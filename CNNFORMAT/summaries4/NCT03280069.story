(firstQuint)Evaluation of Ocular Surface Changes Following RF Electrocoagulation Treatment of the Periorbital Region.

 Subjects with skin laxity and evaporative dry eye will be recruited for enrollment in this study.

 Subjects must present with subjective and objective indicators for periorbital skin laxity and wrinkle grade of 2 or greater out of a 4 point scale.

 To qualify, subjects must present with high symptoms score on subjective Ocular Surface Disease Index(C) (OSDI(C)) Questionnaires (scores 15); Rapid Tear Break up ( 1 of Flourescein Staining in one area of the cornea.

 Each of these parameters are to be assessed prior to treatment and at each follow up visit.

 Treatment is to be performed on periorbital skin only around one eye of the subject using the THERMIeyes(R) standard protocol.

 This may result in some redness of the periorbital skin.

 Subjects are to be seen and treated 2-3 weeks apart for a total of 3 treatments.

 Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after the final treatment.

 A Validated Grading Scale for Crow's Feet will be used to evaluate changes in skin wrinkles and dry eye signs and symptoms scores will be compared with pre-treatment findings.

This protocol will evaluate THERMIeyes(R) for its ability to treat periorbital skin laxity and wrinkles and monitor ocular surface changes and their effect on evaporative dry eye associated with MGD.
