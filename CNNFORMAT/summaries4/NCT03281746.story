(secondQuint)Effect of Prevention Education in Caries Formation in Pediatric Patients With Leukemia.

 Patients treated for leukemia at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center in the department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology are currently receiving oral hygiene instruction at diagnosis.

 In this study, patients will be randomized into two groups at diagnosis: one receiving current prevention education and the other group receiving one-on-one prevention education and counseling with the physician and pediatric dental resident.

 Physician and pediatric dental resident will use motivational interviewing informed techniques during counseling.

 A caries risk assessment will be performed for each patient at diagnosis.

 Caries incidence, plaque scores, mutans streptococci levels, salivary flow rate, and salivary pH will be assessed at week one (diagnosis), week 16 or start of interim maintenance therapy whichever comes second, week 32 or beginning of maintenance therapy whichever is later for all patients enrolled in the study.

 Data will be collected through a clinical intraoral examination and salivary sample.

 Data collected will be used to assess the effect of increased prevention education on factors of importance in caries formation.
