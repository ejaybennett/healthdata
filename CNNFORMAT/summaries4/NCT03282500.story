(fifthQuint)Advances in Treatment: Examining the Effectiveness of a Behavioral Intervention.

.

 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents a significant, adverse life event.

 Among the estimated 634,000 pediatric TBI cases occurring annually in the United States (Langlois, Rutlan-Brown, & Thomas, 2006), some reports suggest that approximately 50% of these children and adolescents will develop emotional and behavioral problems.

 For example, pediatric TBI is associated with negative psychosocial health outcomes including symptoms of internalizing such as depression, (Bloom et al.

, 2001; Fann, Hart, & Schomer, 2009), withdrawal, and anxiety, and symptoms of externalizing such as impulsivity and aggression (Iversion, 2005; Cole et al.

, 2008).

 These maladaptive symptoms are typically correlated with problems in interpersonal relationships and overall social adjustment, contributing to further detriment to social and emotional development (Ganesalingam et al.

, 2011).

 Despite these statistics, our understanding of how to best treat problematic psychosocial sequelae that follow pediatric TBI is largely uncertain and remains an understudied area in the literature.

 Indeed, relatively few empirically rigorous studies have been conducted examining effective treatment methods targeting internalizing and externalizing symptoms among youth with a TBI; yet, this is an essential area of study that needs to be a priority in research efforts (Semrud-Clikeman, 2010).

 Given the beneficial outcomes found with other pediatric populations, it is expected that the MBCT intervention would have a similar, positive impact on adjustment among children and adolescents post TBI.

 Problems in impulsivity, emotional lability, and anxiety are experienced by many children and adolescents with a TBI, suggesting that a MBCT intervention, which focuses on improving attention, regulatory processes, and reducing stress, would be particularly advantageous for this population.

 Youth that meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to either the control group (arts and crafts activities group) or the MBCT experimental condition.

 The treatments will be 75 minute, weekly sessions for 8 weeks.

 Advances in Treatment: Examining the Effectiveness of a Behavioral Intervention.

@highlight

The purpose of this research is to investigate the influence a mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention will have on internalizing and externalizing problems in children and adolescents that have suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

 MBCT is a manualized intervention developed to increase social-emotional resiliency through mindful attention.

 Internalizing problems refer to a set of symptoms in which a person over-controls their emotions and results in social withdrawal, feelings of worthlessness, depression, and anxiety (Bloom et al.

, 2001).

 In contrast, externalizing problems refer to an under-control of emotions which results in conduct problems, impulsive behavior, and aggression.

 Social and emotional difficulties are prominent consequences of childhood TBI.

 Left untreated or undertreated, these problems often persist into adulthood, producing a wide range of challenges adapting in personal and vocational domains.

 At present, there are minimal non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches that effectively treat psychosocial deficits unique to TBI.

 Developing innovative, evidence based methods is essential in helping children recover from the injury.
