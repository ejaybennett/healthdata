(firstQuint)Endothelial Cell Specific Molecule-1 (ESM-1): a Novel Biomarker for ARDS Endothelial Injury.

 70 patients who diagnosed as ARDS were included in this study.

 Then keep blood samples from these patients in the first day, the third day and the seventh day, detect ESM-1 level in plasma by ELISA.

 Record Severity of illness and survival status of every patient within 28 days.

 Objective to evaluate the correlation between the level of ESM-1 in plasma and the prognosis of the patients.
