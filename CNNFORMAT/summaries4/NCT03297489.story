(thirdQuint)Intravital Microscopy in Evaluating Patients With Primary Peritoneal, Fallopian Tube, or Stage IA-IV Ovarian Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers during their standard course of treatment (i.

e.

, surgical debulking).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of fluorescein as a marker of tumor vessel permeability.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorescein sodium injection intravenously (IV).

 Patients also undergo observation of primary and metastatic tumors via microscopy over 15-20 minutes during the course of standard of care surgery.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days, at 1-3 weeks, and then up to 2 years.

 Intravital Microscopy in Evaluating Patients With Primary Peritoneal, Fallopian Tube, or Stage IA-IV Ovarian Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well intravital microscopy works in evaluating patients with primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, or stage IA-IV ovarian cancer.

 Intravital microscopic evaluation of tumor blood vessels, blood flow, immune cell interactions, and drug uptake may be eventually visualized and may lead to valuable prognostic information.
