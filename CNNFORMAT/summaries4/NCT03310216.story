(thirdQuint)The Clinical Application of Artificial Intelligent(AI) Visual Inspection System.

 Patients 90 years old from ophthalmic clinic are enrolled to a prospective, randomized controlled study.

 Patients are assigned to two groups: participants in group I are provided AI visual inspection system first and EDTRS later, while in Group II, the participants are provided EDTRS first and AI visual inspection system later.

 All of the visual inspection methods will be repeated two times.

 Investigators compare the accuracy and repeatability of the AI visual inspection system, time consuming, costs and the satisfaction level between two groups.
