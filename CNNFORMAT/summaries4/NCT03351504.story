(secondQuint)Solar Lighting to Reduce Indoor Air Pollution in Rural Uganda.

 One fifth of the global population relies on kerosene lamps for lighting, yet few studies have focused on kerosene lighting as a source of indoor air pollution.

 In our preliminary studies performed in Uganda, we show that homes using solar lighting have much lower levels of indoor air pollution compared to homes using kerosene lighting.

 The primary goal of this study is to determine the extent to which solar lighting will reduce kerosene use and indoor air pollution in rural Uganda, whether this intervention improves lung health, and to identify the role bacteria in our gut have on determining whether or not people will get sick from indoor air pollution.

 Solar Lighting to Reduce Indoor Air Pollution in Rural Uganda@highlight

This study evaluates the impact of a solar lighting system on kerosene lamp use, levels of indoor air pollution, and health in women living in rural Uganda.

 Half of the participants will receive the lighting systems immediately, while the other half will receive them after an 18 month delay.
