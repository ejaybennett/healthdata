(fifthQuint)SME(Sharing, Mind & Enjoyment) App for Adolescents.

 A cluster randomized controlled trial design was adopted.

 The major subjects of SME (Sharing, Mind, Enjoyment) App Pilot Project RCT Study are 300-500 middle school students.

 Two schools will be recruited and randomized to each group.

 Schools will either be assigned to app intervention group or waitlist control group.

 The students in the intervention group will use the App for one month.

 Daily and Weekly tasks related to SME will be assigned through the App, and information related to mental health will be provided.

 The waitlist control group will be able to use the App after we finish all the assessments.

 There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, one month and three months after) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme.

 In the assessments, students will be asked to complete a questionnaire to measure the changes in SME (sharing, mind and enjoyment) related behaviors, changes of knowledge and attitude towards the anxiety disorder, changes of happiness and well-being.
