(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Macular Changes After Intracameral Moxifloxacin for Prevention of Endophthalmitis.

 Title: Evaluation and Comparison of Macular and Choroidal Thickness after Intracameral Moxifloxacin for Prevention of Postcataract Endophthalmitis Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate if the using of intracameral moxifloxacin cause changes in macular and choroidal thickness.

 Methods: A randomized clinical trial will be conducted in the Hospital of Clinics at State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

 The patients that will be submitted to phacoemulsification surgery will be divided into two groups.

 The first group will receive 0,03ml intracameral moxifloxacin after phacoemulsification surgery, while the second group won't receive any antibiotics intracamerally.

 Both groups will apply eyedrops as usual in the postoperative.

 The investigators will evaluate those patients blindly.

 Each patient will be examined using Spectral Domain - Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Enhanced Depth Imaging - Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT), in the pre-operative, at the 30th postoperative and at the 60th postoperative.

 The data will be collected regarding macular central thickness and choroidal thickness.

 The exclusion criteria will be: - Patients who had any macular changes prior to the surgery (including epiretinal membrane, macular edema, drusen or any other) - diabetic patients - patients who had any complications during the cataract surgery - patients who refuse to participate in the trial, or refuse to sign the consent form After collecting data, the two groups will be compared regarding changes in macular thickness and choroidal thickness from the pre-operative, the 30th and the 60th postoperative.

 The investigators expect that there will be no statistical difference between groups.

 Evaluation of Macular Changes After Intracameral Moxifloxacin for Prevention of Endophthalmitis@highlight

The objective of this study is to evaluate the macular and choroidal thickness of patients submitted to intracameral moxifloxacin during the phacoemulsification surgery for endophthalmitis prophylaxis.

 The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial double-blind.

 The patients will be divided into two groups: one will receive intracameral moxifloxacin injection during phacoemulsification surgery and the other won't.

 Both Spectral Domain - Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Enhanced Depth Imaging - Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) will be performed for each patient pre-operatively and on the 30th and 60th postoperative days.

 After collecting, the data will be compared to evaluate if there was any difference in the macular thickness and choroidal thickness between the two groups.
