(fifthQuint)Frailty Assessment in Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 elderly patients admitted to Meir hospital with acute coronary syndrome will be assessed for frailty twice: the first frailty assessment will be a subjective eye ball testing made by the cardiologist, the second assessment will be an objective one based on Fried frailty score and Edmonton frail scale.

 The cardiologist will not be aware of the objective frailty assessment result.

 The eye ball testing will be compared to the objective frailty assessment (Fried score and Edmonton frailty scale).

 Frailty Assessment in Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome@highlight

Frailty is known as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older cardiac patients .

 It is an important factor on the cardiologist decision between conservative and invasive treatment in older patient with acute coronary syndrome, and is usually made subjectively by the cardiologist known in the literature as eyeball testing.

 in this study the investigators will compare the cardiologists eye ball testing to objective frailty assessment based on Fried score and Edmonton frailty scale.
