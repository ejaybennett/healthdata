(firstQuint)Combination Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Patients With Cervical Cancer.

 This is a single arm, open-label, phase II study to assess progression free survival in patients treated with pembrolizumab, chemotherapy, and bevacizumab for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.

 Progression free survival will be assessed in patients treated with this combination.

 Eligible patients will require tissue biopsy for diagnostic confirmation of metastatic disease, disease recurrence or persistence.

 Patients will be treated with 3 cycles of combination therapy.

 A cycle will consist of pembrolizumab at 200mg (IV), paclitaxel 175mg/m2 or 135mg/m2 (IV), cisplatin 50mg/m2 (or carboplatin AUC 5) and bevacizumab 15mg/kg , on day 1 every 21 days.

 The length of a cycle is 21 days.

 If disease remains following 3 cycles, a second biopsy may be obtained.

 Imaging will be obtained after every 3 cycles to assess for disease response.

 Blood collection will be performed before and after pembrolizumab treatment and at end of study.

 Thirty-nine subjects will be accrued and treated at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC)/University of Miami Hospital (UMH) inclusive of its satellite sites, and Jackson Memorial Hospital for approximately 24 months.

 Therapy will be administered until study completion, withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

 All subjects will be followed for a Safety Evaluation at approximately 30-days (+7 days) after the last dose of study treatment or before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first.

 Thereafter subjects will be followed every 3-months for up to 24 months from the treatment discontinuation for survival data only.

 Combination Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Patients With Cervical Cancer@highlight

The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of standard chemotherapy with bevacizumab with Pembrolizumab in women with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
