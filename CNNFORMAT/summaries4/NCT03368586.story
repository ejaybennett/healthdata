(thirdQuint)Accuracy, Satisfaction and Usability of a FGM System Among Children and Adolescents Attending a Diabetes Summer Camp.

 The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy, satisfaction and usability of a Flash Glucose Monitoring system (FGM) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and attending a 1-week diabetes summer camp, supervised by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers.

 The camp comprised a structured daily routine with five fixed meals: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and evening snack.

 Capillary blood glucose (BG) values were measured in parallel with unmasked Flash Glucose measurements (FGM) using the FGM reader's built-in glucometer at breakfast, lunch and dinner.

 Additional measurements were taken before snacks, between the meals or overnight and BG was measured only in cases of low (15.

0 mmol/L) FGM values or when symptoms were discordant with sensor readings.

 Sensor-related issues were documented and a questionnaire assessing satisfaction and usability of the FGM was completed by patients and caregivers at study completion.
