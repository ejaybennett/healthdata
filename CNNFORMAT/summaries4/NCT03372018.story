(fifthQuint)Promotora-Led Intervention for Metabolic and Mental Health.

 The overall goal of this study is to develop an effective and potentially scalable intervention to prevent diabetes in people with elevated mental health symptoms (EMS) and prediabetes.

 This study focuses on Latinos, a demographic group at particularly high risk for these related conditions.

 Experience from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and related translational studies, suggests that the evidence-based DPP lifestyle intervention is less effective among depressed individuals.

 The proposed Promotora Intervention for Metabolic and Mental Health (PRIME2) will be the first adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention to simultaneously address mental health and prediabetes in a program delivered by promotoras, or community health workers.

 Promotora-Led Intervention for Metabolic and Mental Health@highlight

Evidence-based programs to prevent diabetes among high-risk individuals are less effective among those who also have mental health needs.

 This study involves developing and pilot testing the first adaptation of the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention to simultaneously treat prediabetes and elevated mental health symptoms.

 This project has large potential to impact public health, given that more than half of the U.

S.

 adult population has either of these conditions, and is at risk for developing comorbid diabetes and mental illness.
