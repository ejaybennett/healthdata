The aim of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial for patients undergoing bariatric surgery, comparing the need for opiates with and without administration of a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block using the long acting local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel(R)).

 From this study, the investigators will assess whether use of long acting local anesthetic can reduce the need for opiates in the bariatric population.
