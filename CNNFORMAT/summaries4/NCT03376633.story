(fifthQuint)The Impact of a School-Based, Trauma-Informed CBT Intervention for Young Women.

 The University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab are partnering with the City of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, and Youth Guidance to implement a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of Youth Guidance's Working on Womanhood program in academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19.

 Incoming 9th, 10th, and 11th grade female students in 10 Chicago Public Schools high schools will be screened for eligibility and randomized to either a treatment group that will be offered to receive WOW services over two academic years, or to a control group that will not be offered to receive WOW services over two academic years.

 Control group students will still be eligible to receive other status quo school and community supports.

 Outcomes of interest will be measured using administrative data and a comprehensive student survey.

 WOW is a trauma-informed, in-school group counseling and clinical mentoring program developed by non-profit Youth Guidance.

 Informed by CBT, WOW helps girls challenge unhelpful thoughts and build self-esteem and self-efficacy to make positive and healthy decisions.

 WOW aims to reduce depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, and improve academic and behavioral outcomes.

 WOW delivers a 26-lesson curriculum via weekly small-group counseling sessions during the school day.

 The curriculum is designed around five core values: self-awareness, emotional intelligence, healthy relationships, visionary goal setting, and leadership, and delivered by masters-level social workers and counselors.

 WOW counselors may also provide individual counseling and referrals to other services.

 The WOW program fills a critical gap in the existing set of programs available to these students, by providing services that cater to the unique needs of young women in our most under-resourced high schools.
