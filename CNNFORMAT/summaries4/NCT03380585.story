 Postoperative Pain and PTN and Reciproc@highlight

In this clinical trial, the researchers will investigate the effect of single-file reciprocating file system (Reciproc) versus multi-file rotational file systems (ProTaper Next) on the postoperative pain in adult patients who have necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis.

 The participants will be assigned by chance to separate groups that compare 2 different treatments, reciprocating single-file system (Reciproc) and rotational multi-file system (ProTaper Next).
