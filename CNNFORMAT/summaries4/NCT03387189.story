(thirdQuint)Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Project on Impacted Fetal Head at Cesarean Section.

 Cesarean deliveries performed during the second stage of labor can be difficult due to impaction of the fetal head deep in the maternal pelvis and is associated with increased risk of both maternal and perinatal complications.

 There is little existing data to inform management of deeply impacted fetal heads, therefore these situations can be difficult for surgeons and other healthcare staff when they arise.

 Team simulations for obstetric emergencies have been shown to assist with provider comfort, improved clarity of thinking, and quicker action during emergency situations resulting in improved outcomes.

 This study aims to show that a simulation education project for the entire obstetric team can decrease morbidity of difficult fetal head extraction associated with second stage cesarean deliveries and improve provider and nursing staff confidence regarding anticipation and management of this emergency.

 The simulation education project is not being conducted for the purpose of research, but is a department-wide educational activity and Quality Improvement project.

 Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Project on Impacted Fetal Head at Cesarean Section@highlight

This study is an evaluation of a Quality Improvement (QI) project addressing delivery of the impacted fetal head being conducted at Regions Hospital.

 This study aims to determine the morbidity of second stage cesarean deliveries before and after implementation of simulation protocols that address delivery of the impacted fetal head for Ob/gyn surgeons, nursing staff, and surgical technicians at Regions Hospital.
