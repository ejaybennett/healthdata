(fifthQuint)Trials of Clinical Curative Effect, Follow-up Study and Hemodynamics of Treatment of IA Using Stents.

 Studies showed 3.

6% - 6% for the incidence and 1% - 2% for the ruptctued rate of IA.

The mortality and morbidity account for 22% to 25% in cerebrovascular disease ,which is a growing trend.

 IA is one of the major diseases which relate with people's living standards.

 Endovascular embolization is one of the main treatments of IA with less invasive, Better cure rates and higher safety.

 It has been developed rapidly and improve quality of patients' lives after treatmen.

With the rapid development of neural intervention and the proliferation of specialized stents in IA, stent-assisted embolization technique is becoming more and more common .

Especially, stents play an important role in intracranial aneurysmal aneurysm.

 There are many kinds intracranial stents for clinical surgery, but how to choose the appropriate stent type is one of the key issues that clinicians need to settle.

 And, there is no relevant multicenter cases study about selection strategy of intracranial stent at home and abroad.

 Trials of Clinical Curative Effect, Follow-up Study and Hemodynamics of Treatment of IA Using Stents@highlight

Intracranial aneurysms (IA) regarded the third cause of cerebral vascular disease is the majoy cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

 The mortality and morbidity account for 22% to 25% in cerebrovascular disease.

 More than half of the ruptured IA survivors has serious nerve dysfunction such as hemiplegia, aphasia,which seriously harms to human health.

 Endovascular embolization is one of the main treatment ways of IA.

However,there are no studies on the multicenter cases of stent selection strategy at home and abroad.

Therefore, the investigators conduct a prospective study by comparing the clinical efficacy, follow-up results, and hemodynamics between preoperative and postoperative patients with different types of stent assisted embolization treatment of IA.

The investigators also study the relationship between cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B antisense RNA 1 gene(CDKN2BAS1 gene)of IA patients and the results, for making indication of stents, improving the cure rate, reducing the recurrence rate of IA patients, providing theory gist for interventional therapy of complex IA and simplying slection of stent.
