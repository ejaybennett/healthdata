(fifthQuint)Physiotherapeutic Rehabilitation in Patients After Orthognathic Surgery.

 BACKGROUND: Patients with dental-facial deformity require orthognathic surgery to improve face profile and asymmetry, and to correct malocclusion.

 Positional changes in the mandible, jaw or both jaws during can affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), chewing muscles, surrounding soft tis-sue and symptoms of joint dysfunction (TMD).

 Pain is a natural response of the body to injury and at the same time one of the symptoms defining the inflammatory reaction.

 Orthognathic surgery procedures are often used to correct skeletal deformation II and III of the skeletal class, dental-facial-maxillary deformation, mandibular laterognathion and maximal-facial asymmetry.

 After-care care of the patient aims to minimize the risk of complications and therapy of existing ones.

 Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain is one of the basic activities in post-operative care of the patient.

 Some studies have shown that patients undergo-ing physiotherapeutic care immediately recover from the surgery much more quickly.

 The use of physical treatments allows to obtain a significant faster improvement in the pain and associated swelling after surgery.

 PROBLEM: The motivating factors for patients undergoing orthognathic surgery are: improvement of chewing, speech and swallowing as well as aesthetic and psychosocial factors.

 Correction of occlusal defects requires a group orthodontic, surgical and rehabilitation treatment.

 Surgical techniques that have evolved over the last decades now allow for almost any displacement within the bony structures of the jaw and mandible.

 The pain after orthogonal surgery occurs almost always, although the degree of its severity is the subjective sensation of each patient.

 Patients above all experience pain from mild to severe.

 His post-operative treatment is very important to reduce the stress caused the occurrence itself pain.

 Postoperative pain is often controlled by the use of opioids, which are often used in the United States.

 Cold compresses are also used in the stimulus treatment to reduce pain related associated with the occurrence of edema.

 Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain is one of the basic activities in post-operative care of the patient.

 Pharmacotherapy often necessary also causes a number of adverse effects harmful to the whole organism.

 In order to restore the physical and psychological comfort of patients after orthognathic procedures, physiotherapeutic methods as well as physiotherapeutic devices can be used.

 AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the combined physiotherapeutic method, which uses a slow-changing electromagnetic(ELF EMF) field and light energy, emitted from high-energy LEDs, in reducing pain in patients after orthognathic surgery.

Orthognathic surgery procedures are often used to correct for skeletal II and III skeletal deformation, dental-facial-maxillary deformation, mandibular laterognathy and maxillofacial asymmetry.

 The factors that motivate patients to undergo this procedure are: improvement of chewing, speech and swallowing as well as aesthetic and psychosocial factors.

 Correction of occlusal-facial defects requires team orthodontic, surgical and rehabilitation treatment.

 As with any surgical procedure, various preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative com-plications may occur.

 Late complications that may occur in variously long periods of time from surgery include among others dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, idiopathic atrophy of the condyloid muscles and associated pain.

 After orthognathic operations, pain occurs almost always, although the degree of its severity is a subjective sensation of each patient.

 Regardless of intensity, the fight against pain is one of the basic activities in post-operative care of the patient.

 The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the physiotherapeutic method, which uses a slow-changing electromagnetic field and light ener-gy emitted from high-energy LEDs - light emitting diode, Magnetholedoterpy, in reducing pain in patients after orthognathic surgery Using the Viofor JPS device (Med & Live)
