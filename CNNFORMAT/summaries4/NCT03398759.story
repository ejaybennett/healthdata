(secondQuint)Butorphanol Mitigate Emergence Agitation in Patients Undergoing Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.

 Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid with strong appa-receptor agonist and weak mu-receptor antagonist activity.

 It is commonly used for the management of cancer, postoperative, gynecologic, and obstetric pain.

 Additionally, Butorphanol has less respiratory depression and sedation effects, which make it may become a good medicine to alleviate the agitation.

 However, there is no clinical evidence to confirmation of such effectiveness of butorphanol.

 The objective of present study is to explore the effectiveness of butorphanol in the alleviation of emergence agitation in patients undergoing Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.
