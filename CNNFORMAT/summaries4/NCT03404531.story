(fifthQuint)Project Minority AIDS Prevention: Reaching Black and Hispanic MSM About PrEP and TasP Using Social Media.

 For this Minority AIDS Research Project, the investigators will develop and pilot test an intervention to improve the science of treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake as a public health strategy to decrease new HIV infections among Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men.

 This project uses a 3-phase study design to address the proposed Specific Aims.

 First, the investigators will use focus groups to gather feedback on our existing interactive Men2MenRI website that was developed for and by predominately White men who have sex with men in Rhode Island that includes information on treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as other health and wellness topics to make it more culturally-tailored to Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM.

 Second, the investigators will use cognitive interviewing techniques to develop and assess the acceptability of Information-Motivation-Behavioral/Social Cognitive Theory-grounded social media message content designed to motivate and encourage access to a newly developed and culturally-tailored interactive website.

 Third, the investigators will pilot test a two-arm trial comparing the combination of sending Information-Motivation-Behavioral/Social Cognitive Theory-guided messages plus the newly developed and culturally-tailored interactive website (active arm) to the website alone (control arm) to examine whether the combination approach will: 1) increase treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake (primary outcome); 2) increase knowledge of, more favorable attitudes toward, and increase behavioral intentions of treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis use behaviors (exploratory outcome).

 This study is innovative in the use of a combination approach to treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake that leverages advances in social media as a platform for motivating behavior change.

 Project Minority AIDS Prevention: Reaching Black and Hispanic MSM About PrEP and TasP Using Social Media@highlight

This project has the potential to improve the implementation science of treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake as a public health strategy for reducing new HIV infections in the United States.

 The investigators will develop and pilot test an intervention that combines messages sent over social media plus a newly developed interactive website specifically developed by and for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM to encourage treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis use.

 Findings from this research can guide policy guidelines and recommendations for treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake for high-risk groups.
