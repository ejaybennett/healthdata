(thirdQuint)Panitumumab-IRDye800 Compared to Sentinel Node Biopsy and (Selective) Neck Dissection in Identifying Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if near-infrared fluorescence imaging of panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify metastatic disease in regional neck lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify sentinel nodes with the same accuracy as technetium Tc 99m-labeled tilmanocept (Lymphoseek).

 OUTLINE: Beginning 2-5 days before surgery, patients receive panitumumab IRDye800 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes.

 On the day before surgery, patients also receive technetium Tc 99m-labeled tilmanocept via injection and undergo lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT).

 After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.

 Panitumumab-IRDye800 Compared to Sentinel Node Biopsy and (Selective) Neck Dissection in Identifying Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well panitumumab-IRDye800 works in identifying head and neck cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer.

 Panitumumab-IRDye800 may help surgeons to identify metastatic lymph nodes during surgical removal of the primary tumor and/or lymph nodes of the neck with equal or better accuracy than the current methods.
