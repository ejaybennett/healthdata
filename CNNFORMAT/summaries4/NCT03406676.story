(firstQuint)Pre-treatment With Methylene Blue Prevent Peri-operative Reduced Systemic Vascular Resistance.

 Hemodynamic characteristics of patients with obstructive jaundice are high cardiac output, low peripheral vascular resistance.

 The molecular basis for this feature is the increased production of NO.

 Methylene blue can increase peripheral resistance, the mechanism is: methylene blue is an oxidoreductase inhibitor, can inhibit the increased production of NO in the vascular endothelium, thereby increasing peripheral vascular resistance.
