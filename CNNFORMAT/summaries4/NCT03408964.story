(secondQuint)Valid Biomarkers in Blood to Predict the Response to Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients.

 Participants to the study will be assigned to 4 cohorts according to the stage of disease and planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

 Group 1a (control): the first blood sampling will be performed within 4 weeks since the negative biopsy; subsequent samplings will be done according to a schedule comparable to that of Group 1 up to 1 year or evidence of tumor, whichever occurs first.

 Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3: the first blood sampling will be performed before radical treatment or HT start or CT start, on the basis of the planned antitumor therapy; subsequent sampling will be done after radical intervention at 4 weeks (only for Group 1) and then every 3 months (or more frequently if clinically indicated), up to 3 years or evidence of tumor recurrence/progression (radiological or biochemical), whichever occurs first.

 At the time of recurrence/progression, patients of Group 1 could become part and could be followed as per Group 2, and patients of Group 2 could become part and could be followed as per Group 3.

Participants to the study will be assigned to 4 cohorts according to the stage of disease and planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

 In all patients, 8 ml of blood sample will be collected in EDTA tube for analysis of biological biomarkers in different time points.
