(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Reporting of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors Associated Cardiovascular Adverse reactioN.

 AAs have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination.

 However, AEs can occur.

 Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.

org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of cardiovascular adverse drug reaction following treatment with AAs.

 Evaluation of Reporting of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors Associated Cardiovascular Adverse reactioN.

@highlight

Antiangiogenics (AAs) which are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors might have high grade adverse events (AEs) on the cardio-vascular system.

 This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular toxicity with treatment including VEGF and VEGFR inhibitors using the World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase.
