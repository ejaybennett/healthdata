(fifthQuint)Evaluating an Internet-Based Self-Management Intervention for Borderline.

 In the treatment of psychological disorders, web-based self-help programs can be very helpful, especially when combined with psychotherapy.

 However, up to this point, there are no respective programs for patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), although this disorder is associated with severe personal suffering and requires time-consuming therapy, which, in many cases, cannot be provided, due to the lack of therapeutic supply.

 In this study, treatment effects of the web-based self-help program Priovi on BPD symptom severity when added to treatment as usual will be investigated.

 Priovi is a comprehensive program, which is conceptually and substantially based on the schema therapeutic approach used in BPD patients.

 It contains interactive dialogues that can be accessed via computer or smartphone, illustrations, audios and motivating text messages.

 After a phone pre-screen and a diagnostic evaluation conducted by a psychiatrist, 200 patients suffering from BPD will be randomized into either the intervention group or into the waitlist control group.

 Priovi's duration of use is one year, measuring points will be determined before beginning of treatment (T0) as well as after 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3) and 12 months (T4).

 The primary outcome variable will be the score of the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI), a highly reliable external assessment tool measuring BPD severity.

 Secondary outcome variables will be BPD symptom severity (as assessed by self-ratings), symptom severity of depression and anxiety as well as quality of life.

 The study will be collaboratively conducted by the University of Lubeck and the GAIA AG in Hamburg.

 In this study, Priovi for BPD patients will be tested in a randomized controlled trial.

 It will be used as add-on therapy combined with any guideline therapy available to the respective patients.

 In doing so, the following hypothesis will be investigated: Compared to patients, who exclusively receive treatment as usual, the additional use of the self-help program in question will lead to a stronger decrease in BPD symptom severity.

 Evaluating an Internet-Based Self-Management Intervention for Borderline@highlight

The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel internet intervention (Priovi), which was designed to introduce relevant schema therapy techniques to Persons with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

 Therefore, 200 people with BPD will be recruited and randomized to two groups: (1) a control group, in which they may engage with any BPD treatment (Care-as-Usual, CAU) and receive access to Priovi after a delay of 12 months (i.

e.

, CAU/wait list control group), or (2) to a treatment group that immediately receives 12-month access to Priovi and may also use CAU.

 The primary outcome measure is the score of the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI), collected at three, six and 12 month post-baseline.
