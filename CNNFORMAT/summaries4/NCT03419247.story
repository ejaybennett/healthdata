(fifthQuint)Molecular Profiling of Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers.

 Changes (mutations) in genes have been shown to be an important characteristic in cancers.

 Looking at differences in genes in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer and comparing this information with response to their initial chemotherapy treatment may help to learn which treatments may be better for certain patients after initial treatment.

 Molecular Profiling of Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers@highlight

This is a study where fresh tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected from patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who will be undergoing 1st line therapy with gemcitabine or fluorouracil (5-FU) regimens to see how useful it is to look for changes and characteristics in genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and functioning of the cells) and the genes within the tumour to find characteristics that may be useful in choosing treatments for patients in the future.
