(secondQuint)Study of Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (LN-145) Alone and In Combo With Durvalumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI.

 The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of up to 6 doses of IL-2.

 Patients in Cohort 2 will also receive durvalumab Q4Weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

This study is a Phase 2, open-label, 2-cohort, multicenter study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous TIL therapy (LN-145) alone, (Cohort 1), or in combination with durvalumab (anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] monoclonal antibody [mAb]) (Cohort 2).
