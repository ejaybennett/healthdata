(fifthQuint)Clinical Trial of TCM Collaborative Care Model in Axial Spondyloarthritis.

 The objective of this study is to determine the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of a new model of care in the management of Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) using a pragmatic trial approach.

 In this study, we define TCM physician involved collaborative model of care (TCMCMC) as TCM physician delivered acupuncture as well as TCM physician's history taking, physical examination, non-pharmacological advice and communications with rheumatologists in addition to the usual rheumatological care.

 The TCMCMC involves TCM physicians diagnosing patients based on TCM clinical syndromes and prescribing standardised acupuncture treatment.

 The patient population will still receive their standard of care (drug therapy and physiotherapy) as background therapy.

 The proposed study will not be investigating any therapeutic or medicinal products (drugs).

 Our primary hypothesis is that novel TCMCMC in patients with AxSpA will result in better pain control as compared the usual rheumatological care.

 Secondary hypothesis is that TCMCMC will have greater improvements in other clinical, quality of life, and economic outcomes as compared with those under the usual rheumatological care.

 Clinical Trial of TCM Collaborative Care Model in Axial Spondyloarthritis@highlight

A pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in patients with axial spondyloarthritis who are NSAID inadequate responders.

 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive standard rheumatological care or a Traditional Chinese Medicine physician involved collaborative model of care (i.

e.

 NSAIDs with acupuncture).

 Primary end-point was spinal pain score at week 6 with secondary end-points being evaluated week 24.

 Through this study, we hope to assess a novel model of care in AxSpA and be used as a reference to improve the management of other chronic diseases in Singapore.
