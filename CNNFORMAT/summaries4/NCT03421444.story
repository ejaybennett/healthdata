(fifthQuint)Beijing Children and Adolescents Metabolic Syndrome Study (BCAMS Study).

 A representative sample of 19,593 school children, aged 6-18 years, were chosen from four of the eight urban districts and three of seven rural districts in the Beijing area between April and October, 2004.

 Among these children and adolescents, 4,500 were recognized as having risk factors defined by the presence of any one of the following: overweight, total cholesterol (TC) 5.

2 mmol/L, triglyceride (TG) 1.

7 mmol/L or fasting glucose (FG) 5.

6 mmol/L based on initial finger capillary blood tests.

 Moreover, all subjects at increased risk for metabolic syndrome, together with a parallel reference population of 1,095 children, were invited to undergo medical examinations for verification based on venipuncture blood samples.

 Clinical data, biomarkers including adipokines, and lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet were measured and documented.

 Genetic variants previously reported from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of obesity and diabetes and DNA-methylation were also assessed.

 Further, high-throughput analysis of proteomics and metabolomics of the blood samples were conducted.

 Cross-sectional and follow-up evaluations will be undertaken.

 The unique biochemical and genetic markers for Chinese population will be identified in the BCAMS study.

 The biomarkers will build a solid foundation for progressive study on mechanism of metabolic diseases and lead to early prediction of these diseases.

Base on enriched resources from the Metabolic Syndrome cohort in children, a long-term prospective cohort study will be carried out.

 This cohort is a unique biochemical and genetic database of Chinese population with large number of subjects in the world.

 By collecting information of disease history and lifestyle, measuring clinical and metabolic parameters, especially biomarkers which can reflect the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, we intend to sort out some unique biochemical and genetic markers for Chinese population.
