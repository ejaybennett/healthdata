(firstQuint)Pilot Study for Zoledronic Acid to Prevent Bone Loss After RYGB.

 The investigators are evaluating the ability of a single dose of zoledronic acid given before RYGB to improve bone outcomes after surgery.

 The investigators have previously shown that RYGB has negative effects on skeletal health.

 The purpose of this study is to prevent the bone loss that occurs in adults who have chosen to undergo RYGB.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo.
