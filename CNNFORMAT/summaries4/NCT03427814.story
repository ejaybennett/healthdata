(thirdQuint)Study of BGB-290 or Placebo in Patients With Advanced or Inoperable Gastric Cancer.

 This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized multicenter global phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of single agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor BGB-290 to placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced gastric cancer who have responded to first line platinum based chemotherapy.

 Subjects are randomized 1:1 to BGB-290 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B).

 Randomization will be stratified by geography, biomarker status, and ECOG performance status.

 Patients will undergo tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks, or as clinically indicated.

 Administration of BGB-290 or placebo will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

 After end of treatment, long-term follow-up assessments include tumor imaging every 8 weeks for those patients without disease progression, survival status, and new anticancer therapy.

 Study of BGB-290 or Placebo in Patients With Advanced or Inoperable Gastric Cancer@highlight

This study will enroll subjects with previously-treated advanced or inoperable gastric cancer who have responded to first line platinum therapy into two treatment arms.

 In Arm A subjects will receive BGB-290; in Arm B subjects will receive placebo.

 The purpose of this study is to show that BGB-290 (versus placebo) will improve progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects with advanced or inoperable gastric cancer.
