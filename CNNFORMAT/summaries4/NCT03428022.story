(secondQuint)Apatinib Combined With EGFR-TKI for Advanced Slow-progressed EGFR-TKI Resistant NSCLC.

 Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had treated with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors(EGFR-TKI) and progressed slowly because of resistance are underwent with apatinib mesylate and continuous EGFR-TKI.

 The primary objective is the disease progression free survival of the patients.

 The secondary goals are overall survival, duration of response, objective response rates, disease control rates, quality of life scores and drug safety.

 Currently such patients are treated with EGFR-TKI continuously, but 3 months later, the disease will be progressed rapidly.

 This study will bring a new treatment that are more effective, less toxic and more convenient for NSCLC-patients with EGFR-TKI resistance.
