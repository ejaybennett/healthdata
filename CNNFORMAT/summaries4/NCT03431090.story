(secondQuint)Haploidentical Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Children With Hematologic Malignancies and Myelodysplasia.

 Less than 30% of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) will have an HLA-matched sibling donor.

 There is a high likelihood of being unable to identify a perfect HLA matched unrelated donor, and the time to procure the marrow if such a donor is available is generally >3 months.

 An emerging body of literature suggests that related haploidentical HCT with innovative graft engineering may provide equal, or possibly superior, outcomes to conventional unrelated donors.

 This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that HCT using an T cell / CD19+ B cell depleted graft from partially matched related donors will result in rapid, durable hematopoietic engraftment and rapid immune reconstitution with an acceptably low risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD.

This is a Phase I/II study designed to evaluate the kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution and the incidence of acute chronic GVHD after partially matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation using an TCR/CD19+ cell depleted graft.
