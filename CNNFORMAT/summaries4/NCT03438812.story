(firstQuint)Dehydroepiandrosterone Maintain Mitochondrial Quality of Cumulus Cells in Poor Ovarian Responders.

 Women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment participated, including normal ovarian responders (NORs) and poor ovarian responders (PORs).

 PORs were assigned to receive DHEA supplementation or not before the IVF cycle.

 For all patients, cumulus cells (CCs) were obtained after oocyte retrieval.

 In the CCs, mRNA expression of mitochondria-related genes was measured.

 To compare the mRNA expression of mitochondria-related genes in the CCs among the three groups.
