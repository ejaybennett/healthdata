(thirdQuint)Alzheimer's Disease and Precision Medicine Research With American Indian and Alaska Native People.

 This study will use a mixed methods approach.

 The Investigators will focus on the American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population seen at the University of Arizona/Banner Health facilities in the Phoenix and Tucson areas.

 First, the recruitment strategies for enrolling AI/ANs will be examined in an implementation evaluation of an existing research program (All of Us) designed to assemble an observational cohort for the Precision Medicine Initiative.

 "All of Us" includes the procurement and storage of biological samples for health research integral to precision medicine.

 AI/ANs are underrepresented in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and genetic research and this study will offer stakeholders valuable information on AI/AN perspectives on AD and preferred methods of communicating about AD, as well as developing a cohort of AI/AN people who are interested in AD and Precision Medicine (PM) research.

 To fulfill these goals, the Investigators will develop culturally tailored materials on AD and PM using qualitative methods, namely key informant interviews.

 In the final step, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of culturally tailored versus standard materials for enrolling AI/ANs into the AD-PM Module, and ultimately into a cohort that will be available for studies of AD and PM.

 Potential participants will be identified through the electronic health record or in person during outpatient clinical visits, emergency department visits, or inpatient hospitalizations.

 Enrollees in the All of Us Research Program will be asked whether they wish to participate in a 30 minute optional study on attitudes, knowledge, and willingness to participate in research, ethnic identity and cognition on AD and PM.

 The investigators estimate that 3,000 AI/ANs will agree and be randomized to receive a 3-4 minute presentation on AD and PM in a standard format (control), or to receive the same information presented in the culturally tailored format (intervention).

This mixed-methods, multi-state study will develop and evaluate culturally tailored recruitment materials and test their effectiveness for a) engaging American Indian and Alaska Native participants in a culturally tailored recruitment and engagement module focused on Alzheimer's Disease and Precision Medicine (AD-PM); b) enhancing enrollment in AD-PM clinical trials; and c) improving knowledge and attitudes about AD and PM.
