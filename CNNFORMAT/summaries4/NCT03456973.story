(fifthQuint)Nurse AMIE: A Tablet Based Supportive Care Platform in Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 Goals of the Nurse AMIE software program are to regularly assess psychosocial, functional, and symptom needs among metastatic breast cancer patients and to provide appropriate interventions via YouTube style videos, weekly Skype calls (face to face, tablet to tablet) with a patient navigator at Penn State, and appropriate referrals to phone or in person consultations as needed.

 The proposed Nurse AMIE software program will allow for the provision of resources (YouTube style videos, audio files, exercises) to intervene on many of the common symptoms and challenges experienced by metastatic patients.

 This is an identified need on the part of both metastatic patients and their medical care teams.

 Finally, it will also allow patient navigators to check in with patients, reviewing responses to surveys, discerning whether new or different interventions are needed, and connecting women to palliative care and other services if additional care is warranted.

 Nurse AMIE: A Tablet Based Supportive Care Platform in Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

The investigators propose to build and test a supportive care software platform called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) to be provided to metastatic breast cancer patients on Android Tablets.

 This program will be tested in 50 metastatic breast cancer patients within the Penn State Cancer Institute's 28 county catchment area.

 The company with whom the investigator will partner to develop this application is already working with multiple investigators at the institution (Webster Group).
