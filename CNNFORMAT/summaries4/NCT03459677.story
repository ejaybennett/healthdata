(fifthQuint)Back2School - CBT Intervention for School Absenteeism.

 Primary objective The main objective of this study is to examine the efficacy on school attendance and wellbeing of a modular trans-diagnostic CBT intervention for youths with problematic school absenteeism in a randomized controlled trial.

 Based on previous studies we hypothesize that the B2S intervention will show a significant difference in impact for school attendance, in favor of Back2School intervention as compared with TAU Trial design The study is a randomized controlled superiority trial (RCT) that compares a modular trans-diagnostic CBT intervention (Back2School), treating school absenteeism in youths aged 7-17 years with treatment as usual (TAU).

 The design will follow a two (Back2School and TAU) by four (Time: pre, post, 3-month, and 1-year assessment) mixed between-within design.

 The study is a collaboration project between Aarhus University and Aarhus Municipality, Denmark.

 The setting for both the B2S and TAU interventions are within Aarhus municipality.

 The Back2School intervention is organized and conducted by the University Clinic, at Aarhus University.

 Treatment as usual interventions are organized and conducted by Aarhus Municipality.

 There are considerable negative long-term consequences related to youths with school absenteeism.

 If the B2S intervention proves to be effective in reducing school absenteeism, it could be implemented in other municipalities in Denmark, and help to systematically treat and help youths with school absenteeism.

 This could possibly reduce both personal and societal costs significantly.

 Back2School - CBT Intervention for School Absenteeism@highlight

The main objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of a new psychological intervention, called Back2School, in helping youths with problematic school absenteeism to return to school.

 Furthermore, the study will examine how well this program fares against the treatment or interventions that are usually given to youths with school absenteeism (treatment as usual or TAU).

 Based on previous studies we hypothesize that the Back2School intervention will be better at improving levels of school attendance as compared with treatment as usual (TAU).
