(firstQuint)Improving REsectability in Pancreatic NEoplasms (IRENE).

 Aim of the study is to define the percentage of patients with down-staging and clinical response after having undergone stereotactic radiotherapy + chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intent for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma or "borderline resectable" at the time of diagnosis.

 The study evaluates the response to therapy in terms of resectability, of acute and delayed treatment-related toxicity, of overall survival and progression-free survival and also assesses patient's quality of life.
