(fifthQuint)Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome.

.

 Three different groups of spinal cord stimulation will be compared 1.

 BASE - High Density Stimulation - Sham 2.

 BASE - Conventional stimulation- HDS 3.

 BASE - Sham - High Density Stimulation BASE consists of the baseline where no intervention of stimulation will occur.

 Sequentially, two phases will follow which will last 7 days per phase.

 The conventional stimulation is the stimulation that is generally used.

 The high density stimulation is the new spinal cord stimulation offering lots of advantages improving quality of life.

 The 3 different study designs will be compared against each other according to a questionnaire including pain, need for medication, sleep quality, quality of life, effectiveness.

 Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome.

@highlight

When patients suffer from chronic pain after multiple back surgeries, this is denominated as the 'failed back surgery syndrome'.

 A possible treatment for these patients is spinal cord stimulation.

 This is an invasive treatment where no other treatment options (medication, minimal invasive treaments) can offer progress to the patients' health status.

 In spinal cord stimulation, an electrode will be placed at the spinal cord under local anaesthesia whereas via a battery a painless electrical stimulation will arise.

 Clinical research have demonstrated that a new way of spinal cord stimulation can improve back and leg pain significantly.

 This will lead to a better quality of life for the patients and a decreased use of medications.

 In Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, different manners of spinal cord stimulation will be compared to each other.
