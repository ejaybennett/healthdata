(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Adalimumab Versus Ustekinumab for One Year.

 This study compares the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab versus adalimumab.

 It will consist of screening (within 1- 5 weeks prior to Week 0), treatment phase (Weeks 0 to 52), and follow-up phase (up to Week 76).

 The primary hypothesis is that ustekinumab is superior to adalimumab as measured by clinical remission after one year of treatment.

 Study assessments will include Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), video ileocolonoscopy; CD-related healthcare utilization; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); laboratory evaluations; biomarkers; review of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs); and evaluation of serum concentrations of study agent as well as development of antibodies to study agent.

 All participants will randomly be assigned to receive either ustekinumab or adalimumab.

 No participants will be treated with placebo only.

 Safety and Efficacy of Adalimumab Versus Ustekinumab for One Year@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with ustekinumab or adalimumab in biologic naive participants with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease (CD) who have previously failed or were intolerant to conventional therapy (corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate), as measured by clinical remission at one year.
