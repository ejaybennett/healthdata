 The inhalation of certain essential oils has been found to increase stamina and reduce fatigue among athletes but have not been evaluated for the purpose of reducing fatigue among women who experience fatigue as a result of a hypothyroid condition.

 The essential oils used in this study are inhaled mid-afternoon, the time in which women with hypothyroidism typically experience the lowest levels of energy during the day, otherwise known as the "afternoon slump.

" The essential oil is administered during this time to evaluate both the immediate effects on fatigue as well as the overall effects, with measurements at the end of both the first and second week of the study.

 Fatigue is measured on a multi-dimensional scale, a validated instrument that measures not only physical fatigue but also emotional and mental fatigue.
