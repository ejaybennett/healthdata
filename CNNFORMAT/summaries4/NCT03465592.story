(fifthQuint)Trial of Nivolumab Following Partially HLA Mismatched BMT in Children & Adults With Sarcoma.

 High risk, recurrent, or refractory solid tumors in pediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients have an extremely poor prognosis despite current intensive treatment regimens.

 Johns Hopkins piloted an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) platform using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical) related donors for this population of pediatric and AYA solid tumor patients.

With this strategy, investigators demonstrated that RIC haploBMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is feasible and has acceptable toxicities in patients with incurable pediatric and AYA solid tumors; thus, this approach serves as a platform for post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse and optimize progression free survival.

 In this trial, the central hypothesis is that the efficacy of alloBMT for high risk solid tumors can be improved by developing methods to augment donor T cell responses against antigens selectively or uniquely expressed by tumor tissue.

 Investigators aim to demonstrated that PD-1 blockade with nivolumab will be safe and well tolerated after RIC haplo BMT, initially in a relapsed population (Part A) and ultimately when given pre-emptively (Part B).

 Trial of Nivolumab Following Partially HLA Mismatched BMT in Children & Adults With Sarcoma@highlight

This research is being done to find out if an investigational drug, Nivolumab, can be safely administered after a "half-matched" (haplo) bone marrow transplant (BMT), and if the investigational drug will help to prevent or delay relapse or progression of sarcomas.

 In this study investigators will also be trying to learn more about how the investigational drug changes blood and/or tumors.

 Participants are eligible for this trial if they have recently undergone a "half-matched" (haplo) bone marrow transplant and have either relapsed or are at high risk to relapse.
