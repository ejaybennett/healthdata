(thirdQuint)Azacitidine and Venetoclax as Induction Therapy With Venetoclax Maintenance in the Elderly With AML.

 This is a phase 2 study for elderly patients who have not received previous treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

 Up to 42 patients will be enrolled.

 All patients will be treated with azacitidine and venetoclax until a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative response is achieved.

 Once patients achieve a MRD negative composite response, azacitidine will be discontinued and venetoclax dose will be decreased to "maintenance" dose.
