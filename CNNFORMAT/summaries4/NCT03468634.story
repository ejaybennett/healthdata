(secondQuint)Raman Probe for In-vivo Diagnostics (During Oesophageal) Endoscopy.

 The investigators have already shown that it is possible to tell the difference between healthy and diseased tissue in the laboratory by looking at the light emitted by tissue when illuminated with a low power laser.

 The investigators intend to use this technique, known as "Raman Spectroscopy" to tell if tissue in the oesophagus is cancerous, healthy or at some stage before full blown cancer, which is termed pre-cancer.

 It has been shown in the laboratory that this method will be at least as accurate as the conventional methods used now, but will provide the surgeon with instant results without the delay and cost of a laboratory analysis by pathologists.

 A miniature probe has been developed that slides through a channel in the endoscope (telescope) to the surface of the oesophagus to make near instant assessments of its condition without the need for expensive and distressing tissue removal (biopsies).

 This project plans to move this technique from the laboratory to the clinic by demonstrating that the method is safe and reliable for use in real patients.
