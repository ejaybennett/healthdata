(secondQuint)Plasmodium Immunotherapy for Breast and Liver Cancers.

 This study is to enroll 30 patients in each type of cancer.

 Each patient will be vaccinated with P.

vivax-infected red blood cells containing approximately 0.

3-1.

0 * 10^7 Plasmodium parasites and be observed for the exact infection time, parasitemia condition and infection course; principal clinical symptoms such as fever; gastrointestinal reaction; peripheral blood parameters; the changes in heart, lung, liver and kidney function.

 Preliminarily observe the changes in the primary and metastatic lesions of the cancer, the tolerance of patients to Plasmodium infection, changes in tumor-related parameters and immunological related parameters.

The duration of the planned treatment of each subject is 3-6 months.

 The successful infection will be indicated by microscopic observation of parasitemia in peripheral blood samples, and the time of the treatment course is based on the presence of peripheral parasitemia.

 After 3-6 months, parasitemia will be terminated by antimalarial drugs for terminating the treatment of Plasmodium immunotherapy (the immunological treatment effect may persist after the termination of Plasmodium infection).
