 Study Design This study will be conducted in descriptive qualitative design - case series.

 Descriptive qualitative design is an eclectic and pragmatic approach.

 It presents comprehensive summaries of a phenomenon or events in everyday language.

 It studies a phenomenon to discover patterns and themes about life events intensely.

 Meanings of the data provided by informants should be kept as much as possible in any interpretation of the researcher.

 It helps to in-depth understand the experiences of caring individuals with first episode psychosis in Hong Kong.

 It also allowed them to express their observed social inappropriate behaviors and perceived burdens and coping strategies in their own words.

 Case series is a report on a series of patients with an aggregation of several similar cases and similar outcome of interest.

 It also regards as a collection of patients with common characteristics used to describe related clinical, pathophysiological or operational aspects of a disease, treatment or diagnostic procedures.

 It was used to describe a clinical event of one or several group of patients in a narrative form.

 Sampling Purposive sampling will be employed in this study.

 Purposive sampling allows rich and in-depth data collection as researcher purposely selecting subjects who are judged to be suitable in the population or particularly knowledgeable about the issues under study.

 It is particular well suited to this study as it provides a systematic way of exploring the full picture of the observed phenomenon.

 Using homogeneous purposive sampling can ensure selecting samples for having a shared characteristic or set of characteristics and focusing on one specific subgroup in which all the sample members are similar in a particular level or hierarchy.

 Recent literature suggested the sample size of case series study should be at least five cases.

 The subjects will be recruited from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH) and North District Hospital (NDH) psychiatric specialist out-patient clinic.

 The psychiatrists working in Early Assessment Services for Young People with psychosis (EASY) team will refer the suitable Chinese cases after granted the agreement from potential subjects.

 The Inclusion criteria framed all target subjects were Hong Kong primary caregivers whose offspring was primary diagnosed of schizophrenic spectrum disorder with social inappropriate behavior after onset of illness.

 The patient should be under active care by EASY team.

 The cases of bipolar affective disorder and drug induced psychosis should be excluded from the study.

 In addition, the cases of active substance abuse and presenting active psychotic symptoms were also not suitable for the study.

 Study Population Description Socially inappropriate affectionate behavior was occasionally identified by clinicians in patient with first episode psychosis.

 Socially inappropriate behavior was mainly observed as social inappropriate affectionate behavior, childish behavior and regressive behavior.

 Clinicians observed some patient became excessively dependent on family members and displayed intimate physical contact towards family members.

 Such socially inappropriate behaviors may explain by schizophrenic thinking or schizophrenic regression.

 The concept of schizophrenic regression is commonly associated with the work of Sigmund Freud.

 Freud's view of regression did not assume demonstrable nervous system damage but assume that regression could be spontaneous and influenced by environmental factors.

 It could permit the removal of psychological barriers that were inhibiting mature mental processes when regression occurred.

 According to Sigmund Freud, regression is an unconscious defense mechanism which causes the temporary or long-term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development.

 The term "regression" refers to events in which an individual change from present level of maturity and regains mental and behavioral characteristics shown at an earlier point in development.

 Proponents of classical psychoanalytic theory considered psychosis makes patient return to the period prior to the structuring of the ego.

 It causes a loss or destruction of the characteristics of normal adult thought processes accompanied by a reversion to the more concrete forms of thought characteristic of the young child.

 It was regarded as the one of defense mechanism which allows individual to have self-protection against difficult circumstances.

 Regression used to describe an organism's reversion to functioning in ways characteristic of an earlier period of life.

 Regression in adults can arise at any age and it entails retreating to an earlier developmental stage in forms of emotional, social or behavioral.

 It also viewed as the "backward" movement of the libido from a frustrated present-day object to an object that had been satisfactory at an earlier point in development.

 The earlier stage was a period of fixation which making it attractive to the libido when reality became frustrating and symptoms were associated with characteristics of the early period.

 This is regarded as a movement back in psychological time which behaviors became more childish or primitive when an individual facing trouble, frightened and distressed situation.

 The source of regressive behavior is broad and includes both medical and psychiatric conditions.

 Regressive behavior can be a manifestation of inadequate or maladaptive coping as patients employ immature defense mechanisms to manage their stress.

 Patient who is overwhelmed by stress or frustration might automatically exhibit regressive behaviors.

 In addition, regressive behavior usually regards as attention seeking behavior as well as a mean to communicating individual's distress and provoke others to provide more attention and care.

 Each interview will be conducted around 60 minutes until data saturated.

 The interview will be audio-taped with informed consent from subjects.

 The interview will be audio-taped and being transcribed into verbatim in text material for data analysis.

 The richness of the data could be enhanced with referencing the field notes taken in the interview.

 Data analysis Content analysis will be used for analyzing the content's meaning of the text data.

 It is used for finding numerous textual contents to determine trends and relationship of reality by systematic coding and categorizing approach.

 Phases and key words within the text in verbatim which shared the common ground and meaning were interpreted and divided into related themes.

 Ethical Consideration The study was governed and monitored by NTEC-CUHK Joint CREC.
