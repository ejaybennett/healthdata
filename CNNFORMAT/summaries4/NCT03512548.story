(fifthQuint)Study in Healthy Subjects to Determine the Effect of an Inhibitor on Exposure to Relacorilant and Its Metabolites.

 This is an open label, single sequence, crossover study.

 In Part 1, eligible subjects will participate in 3 treatment periods, in which they will receive the following treatments in turn: 1) In Period 1, a single 350 mg dose of relacorilant administered alone, 2) In Period 2, once daily 200 mg doses of itraconazole administered for 3 days; 3) In Period 3, single 350-mg dose of relacorilant administered with a concomitant 200 mg dose of itraconazole and continued once daily 200 mg doses of itraconazole for three additional days.

 Part 2 of the study may be conducted if the results from Part 1 indicate that itraconazole has a clinically meaningful effect on exposure to relacorilant and metabolites.

 If Part 2 is conducted, eligible subjects will participate in 3 treatment periods, in which they will receive the following treatments in turn: 1) In Period A, 14 days of oral dosing with "higher dose" relacorilant alone; 2) In Period B, 14 days of oral dosing with "lower dose" relacorilant alone; 3) In Period C, 14 days of oral dosing with "lower dose" relacorilant in combination with itraconazole.

 Blood samples will be collected before dosing and at intervals up to 96 hours after relacorilant dose in Part 1, and up to 24 hours after the last dose of relacorilant in Part 2.

 Additional samples will be collected during the itraconazole dosing to confirm exposure.

 Safety and tolerability will be monitored using AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECG recordings, vital signs, and and physical examinations.

 Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on the morning of Day -1 following an 8-hour fast for baseline assessments and will remain confined until completion of procedures.

 Each subject will have a follow-up (FU) visit 14 2 days after the last dose of relacorilant.
