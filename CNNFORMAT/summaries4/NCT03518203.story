(fifthQuint)Eculizumab to Treat Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome -Associated Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients.

 This clinical trial is a prospective single arm multi-institution study in children and young adults undergoing allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who will receive early therapy with eculizumab to prevent TMA-associated MODS after transplantation.

 The purpose of this research study is to examine efficacy of complement blocker eculizumab in HCT recipients with high risk TMA and to determine optimal eculizumab dosing regimen for HCT recipients with TMA using PK/PD studies.

 All patients will receive therapy based on their weight for 24 weeks.

 Survival will be assessed at 6 months from TMA diagnosis.

 Eculizumab to Treat Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome -Associated Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients@highlight

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an understudied complication of HCT that significantly affects transplant related morbidity and mortality.

 The investigators hypothesize that early intervention with complement blocker eculizumab will double survival in HCT recipients with high risk TMA, as compared to historical untreated controls.

 An optimal eculizumab dosing schedule can be determined for this population through eculizumab pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) testing.
