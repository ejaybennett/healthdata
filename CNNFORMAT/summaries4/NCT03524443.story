(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Art-therapy on Alexithymia in Patients Suffering From Anorexia Nervosa and From Bulimia.

 Alexithymia, defined by difficulties to identify and describe feelings as well as a poverty of imaginary life, is found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia (BN) in numerous studies.

 Some publications show that it is a factor of resistance in several forms of psychotherapies and of poor prognosis for these patients who already present a high rate of chronification and mortality because of the complications of the undernutrition and the suicide risk.

 Art therapy is very wide-spread in the care of AN and of BN, but little studied.

 About alexithymia, if there is no psychotherapy having made the proof of its efficiency currently, some studies suggest the interest of art-therapy on alexithymic features, but none, to our knowledge, estimated the effect.

 The investigator suggest to describe the evolution at 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale in 20 items (TAS-20), in patients with AN or BN.

 The investigators shall also describe the evolution at 1 month with the TAS-20 as well as the relationship between variations of alexithymia and BMI in patients presenting AN at 3 months.

 The investigators will also evaluate the effect of depression and anxiety at 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia.

The investigators shall realize an observational prospective multicenter cohort study design.

 Each patient will receive standard care: multidisciplinary and corresponding to the HAS recommendations and semimonthly or weeklies sessions of art therapy, using all types of art.

 Thus, each patient will be her own control before art therapy.
