(thirdQuint)Palbociclib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Rb Positive Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With Activating Alterations in Cell Cycle Genes (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial).

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in pediatric patients treated with palbociclib with advanced solid tumors (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in cell cycle genes.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with palbociclib with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in alterations in cell cycle genes.

 II.

 To obtain information about the tolerability of palbociclib in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

 Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Palbociclib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Rb Positive Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With Activating Alterations in Cell Cycle Genes (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial)@highlight

This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well palbociclib works in treating patients with Rb positive solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders with activating alterations (mutations) in cell cycle genes that have spread to other places in the body and have come back or do not respond to treatment.

 Palbociclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
