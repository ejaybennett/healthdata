(fifthQuint)Omega Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.

 This is a single arm study to assess the safety and performance of the Omega cent Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder in patients with Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

 The study will be conducted in accordance with the ISO standard ISO 14155 (Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice) and other legal requirements as applicable.

 The primary performance endpoint of the study is LAA closure (defined as complete seal or efficient seal with a leak 5 mm) at the 45-60 day visit documented by transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE/TOE), with colour flow Doppler.

 The primary safety endpoint of the study is device-related complications (adverse events) from 7 days to 45-60 days post-procedural.

 The study population recruited will have non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with a CHADS2 score 2 or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 and are deemed unsuitable for anticoagulant therapy.

 Following consent a number of assessments will be undertaken prior to the procedure to ensure the study eligibility criteria are met.

 These assessments include; medical history, physical exams, ECG, blood tests, transthoracic echocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT.

 The implant procedure will usually be performed under general anaesthetic.

 A thin catheter is inserted in the femoral vein in the right groin area and advanced under X-Ray guidance to the right atrium, then a very small needle is used to cross through to the left atrium to allow the delivery catheter to place the Omega in the Appendage, guided by both X-Ray and transesophageal echo.

 A recommended medication regimen for endocarditis prophylaxis anticoagulation is then described post procedure.

 Following discharge, patients will be seen again at 45-60 days then at 6 months.

 Further blood samples will be taken at follow-up as well as; transesophageal echo and adverse event assessments.

 An interim analysis is planned following the collection of 45-60 day data for the first 10 patients implanted with the device.

 Final analysis is planned once the Omega device has been successfully implanted in 50 evaluable patients.

 Omega Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation@highlight

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased risk of stroke mostly because of clot formation in the left atrial appendage, a small alcove in the left atrium heart chamber.

 Plugging this appendage with an implantable plug type device, which is placed via a catheter painlessly in the femoral vein, has been proven to be a reliable alternative to the standard anti-clotting medication in a number of recent international trials.

 The Omega device is a new design of such a plug, made from biocompatible and compressible nitinol and fabric.

 65 patients will be enrolled in this study in Europe and Asia.

 The primary performance endpoint of the study is LAA closure (defined as complete seal or efficient seal with a leak 5 mm) at the 45-60 day visit documented by transoesophageal echocardiogram.
