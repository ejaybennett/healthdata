 Interventions to Attenuate Cognitive Decline: Keys to Staying Sharp.

 The primary objectives is to examine the efficacy of music training to improve central auditory processing (CAP), cognition, and everyday function among older adults.

 The secondary objectives are: - To examine the moderating effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on music training efficacy.

 - To explore mediators of intervention effects.

 Design The design is a two arm randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of music training to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday function in older adults with and without MCI across two time points (baseline and immediate post-test).

 Outcomes The effects of of music training on CAP, cognition, and everyday functional performance will be quantified.

 CAP processing measures will include: Time Compressed Speech 65%, Words-in-Noise, Dichotic Digits Test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, and Adaptive Tests of Temporal Resolution.

 A composite will be derived from principal components analyses.

 Cognition measures will include: Verbal Fluency Test (phonemic fluency, category fluency, and category switching), Trail Making Test, and Digit Coding.

 A composite will be derived from principal component analyses.

 Everyday Function measures will include: Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Test of Everyday Attention.

 A composite will be derived from principal component analyses.

 Interventions and Duration Two types of music training will be investigated.

 The two training conditions will be equivalent in terms of frequency and duration of each session (90 min/day, two days/wk, 10 weeks) and social contact (led by trainer and conducted in groups of up to 10 persons).

 Sample Size and Population In-person screening of a maximum of 500 potential study participants are planned to enroll up to 400 participants.

 The goal is to have at least 200 participants complete the study.

 Individuals with normal cognition and those with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study.

 Interventions to Attenuate Cognitive Decline: Keys to Staying Sharp@highlight

Different cognitive intervention approaches have been developed to attenuate decline (e.

g.

, cognitive engagement, training, or stimulation), but it is not clear which approaches are efficacious.

 It is also not clear when, along the continuum of normal cognitive aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI-a transitional stage before dementia onset), it is most efficacious to intervene.

 This randomized clinical trial will determine the efficacy of a novel cognitive engagement intervention approach (music training) as compared to cognitive stimulation (which will serve as a stringent, active control).

 Grounded in theory, the central hypothesis is that interventions enhancing central auditory processing (CAP), a strong, longitudinal predictor of MCI and dementia, will improve cognition.

 Music training is increasingly recognized as a feasible means to attenuate age-related cognitive decline.

 Prior research and preliminary data suggest that intense piano training enhances CAP and is likely more effective than cognitive stimulation.

 Correlational studies indicate superior CAP, executive function, and other cognitive abilities for adults with formal music training compared to non-musicians.

 The specific aims of the study are to examine the efficacy of music training relative to cognitive stimulation (active controls) to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday function among older adults with and without MCI.

 The efficacy of music training will be established and moderating effects of MCI status will be examined.

 The proposed study further aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of effective cognitive intervention approaches by exploring mediators of training gains.

 The proposed study is the first phase II randomized trial of music training to enhance older adults' cognition.

 Mediation analyses will elucidate the underlying mechanisms of intervention effects.
