(secondQuint)Radio-Immunotherapy Before Cystectomy in Locally Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.

 Patients with locally advanced bladder cancer have a poor prognosis despite radical surgical therapy.

 The addition of perioperative combination chemotherapy did not add significant benefit to surgery alone.

 There is data indicating a synergistic effect of radiation and immunotherapy.

 Therefore, combined application of radiotherapy with Nivolumab before radical cystectomy might lead to improved cure rates and local control in this poor prognosis group with locally advanced bladder cancer.

 The aim of this phase-II study is to assess feasibility and safety of immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant radiation before radical cystectomy.
