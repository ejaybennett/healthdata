(fifthQuint)Bone and Muscle Health in Kids.

 Vitamin D is a modifiable regulator of bone mineral metabolism and muscle function; yet little is known about the role of in utero vitamin D exposure on bone mineral accrual and muscle development in early childhood.

 Observational findings suggest associations between prenatal vitamin D status and infant bone, lean and fat mass and muscle function, but data from intervention trials is either unavailable or limited to early infancy.

 The investigators of the proposed study have previously shown that prenatal vitamin D supplementation safely improves maternal-fetal vitamin D status and perinatal calcium metabolism.

 Given the current interest in the potential role of vitamin D in perinatal health, adequately powered and well-designed randomized trials are required to investigate the effect of maternal vitamin D supplementation on offspring musculoskeletal health and body composition.

 The investigators recently conducted the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth (MDIG) trial (NCT01924013), a randomized placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and lactation in Bangladesh, where severe vitamin D deficiency is common.

 Women at 17-24 weeks' gestation were randomized to 1 of 5 dose groups (range 0-28,000 IU/wk) until 6 months postpartum.

 Enrolment (n=1300) was completed in September 2015, and all infants were delivered by February 2016.

 The MDIG trial was primarily designed to determine the effect of maternal vitamin D on infant length at 12 months of age, with follow-up continuing until infants reach 24 months of age (to be completed in March 2018).

 In the proposed observational follow-up study, the investigators will leverage the design and infrastructure of the MDIG trial to investigate effects of vitamin D on early childhood bone and muscle outcomes in a sample of MDIG participants at 3-4 years of age (n=250).

 The primary objective is to quantify the effects of prenatal vitamin D supplementation versus placebo on offspring bone mineral content and density.

 Secondary objectives are to examine the effect of vitamin D on lean and fat mass, and muscle function.

 Bone, lean and fat mass will be measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

 Muscle strength (handgrip test), anthropometry, dietary intake and vitamin D status will also be assessed, in addition to biomarkers of bone turnover that may affect musculoskeletal health in young children.

 The proposed follow-up study of a large randomized trial will contribute new evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on musculoskeletal health in childhood.

Vitamin D deficiency in childhood leads to poor bone growth and muscle weakness, yet it is unknown if the amount of vitamin D a woman consumes during her pregnancy affects her child's bone and muscle development.

 In collaboration with researchers in Bangladesh, the investigators recently completed a study of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in which women were assigned to 1 of 5 groups containing vitamin D or placebo (no vitamin D).

 The investigators now aim to conduct a follow-up study of a sample of 250 3-4 year old children born to these mothers to test the possible effects of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy on children's bones, their body composition and the strength of their muscles.
