(firstQuint)Effect of Digoxin on PKM2 Binding to Pro-inflammatory Loci and Innate Immune Inflammatory Responses in the Peripheral Blood.

.

 To investigate the effect of orally administered digoxin on innate immune inflammatory responses in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects.

 We hypothesize the reduction in innate immune inflammatory responses will be expected in the peripheral blood with the effect of oral digoxin.

 To investigation of how human peripheral blood immune cells change their inflammatory responses after exposure to digoxin in vitro.

 Effect of Digoxin on PKM2 Binding to Pro-inflammatory Loci and Innate Immune Inflammatory Responses in the Peripheral Blood.

@highlight

To investigate the effect of digoxin on pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) binding to pro-inflammatory loci and innate immune inflammatory responses in the peripheral blood in healthy subjects.
