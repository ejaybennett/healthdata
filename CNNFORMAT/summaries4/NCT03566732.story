(fifthQuint)ERANet-LAC CODE: International Care Of the Dying Evaluation.

 ABSTRACT Background: In order to ensure the highest quality of care is provided for dying patients and their families, one needs to first be able to robustly evaluate the current quality of care.

 One identified method is to assess this from the user-perspective by conducting bereaved relatives' surveys.

 'Care Of the Dying Evaluation' (CODE) is a recognised, validated post-bereavement questionnaire which has been extensively used within the United Kingdom.

 The ERANet-LAC CODE project aims to use CODE in a wider international context.

 In Work Package 1 of the project, CODE will be translated and pilot tested in volunteers and bereaved relatives in the partner countries.

 Using a consensus procedure, a final version of the international CODE (i-CODE) questionnaire will be developed.

 Aims: The present project (Work Package 2) aims to advance the international evidence in care for dying cancer patients by undertaking an observational study of bereaved relatives' views across seven participating countries.

 The overall aims of Work Package 2 (WP2) are to: - Conduct an international survey of bereaved relatives of cancer patients dying in hospitals, using the CODE questionnaire - Use the CODE data to provide feedback about the quality of care and level of family support at an international and national level, allowing for cross-country comparisons - Conduct a web survey of all participating institutions to be able to interpret the survey data in the context of information about each organisation and the level of specialist palliative care provision at each site / country Methods: Bereaved adult relatives, to adult cancer patients who had an 'expected' death in hospital, will be approached face to face, by telephone or in writing and invited to complete the CODE questionnaire.

 The CODE questionnaire pack will be sent out 6-8 weeks after bereavement.

 CODE may be completed via self-completion paper questionnaire, via on-line questionnaire, or facilitated via a researcher using a tablet, telephone or face-to-face interview, according to what is feasible and acceptable in each country.

 The aim is 100 completed questionnaires per country.

 Basic demographics will be recorded for all potential participants and for the patients who died.

 Analysis of results: Data will be analysed using SPSS and according to the CODE user guide, to present a common international report, individual country reports and cross-country comparisons.

 Data will be interpreted in the context of knowledge about the individual sites/countries.

 Conclusions: The expected outcomes from WP2 are an international survey and cross-country comparisons about the current quality of care for dying cancer patients as perceived by bereaved people, including key areas where care needs to be improved.

 WP3 of the project will use the results of the international survey to implement changes to improve the care.

 INTRODUCTION In 2012, 2.

35 million people died from cancer in European and Latin American (EU-LAC) countries.

 Patients with advanced cancer generally experience a number of distressing symptoms and face problems of a psychological, social and spiritual nature as well as physical ones.

 Care for dying patients is an important part of comprehensive cancer care and a central responsibility for health care on the whole.

 Evidence has identified challenges and disparities in the quality of care for seriously ill and dying patients, both within and across EU-LAC countries.

 An international project which engaged both EU and LAC countries (OPCARE9) already identified areas of common research interest and potential learning between continents.

 The present project was proposed in response to the ERANet-LAC 2nd Joint Call on Research and Innovation and approved for funding under the European Commission's 7th framework program.

 The aim of the project is to inform and develop an evidence based approach to systematically standardize assessment and care of dying cancer patients, using relative generated outcomes.

 The project will be conducted in four European and three South American countries three years starting from January 2017.

 The project contains three Work Packages (parts).

 This protocol describes the work to be undertaken in Work Package 2 (CODE International Survey).

 BACKGROUND The delivery of appropriate care for dying cancer patients remains a key medical, social, economic and political issue.

 However, the quality of care for the dying is diverse both within and between EU-LAC countries.

 The Quality of Death Index 2015 ranges 80 countries around the world based on 20 quantitative and qualitative indicators across five categories: the palliative and healthcare environment, human resources, the affordability of care, the quality of care, and the level of community engagement.

 The European countries of the present proposal all fall within the top 30 of this ranking, ranging from positions 1-26, while the South American countries have positions 32, 39 and 42 respectively.

 Several reports on the current state of palliative and end-of-life care in South America have been published in recent years.

 They show that 80 % of Latin American countries do not acknowledge specialist palliative care as a discipline, and consequently do not include it in public health services.

 Only 51 % of patients in terminal stages of disease receive palliative care.

 Even in the United Kingdom, however, ranked as number 1 in the Quality of Death Index 2015, recent reports have shown significant variations in the care of the dying across hospitals in England (National care of the dying audit - hospitals, England 2014).

 In Norway, ranked as number 13 overall, but number 9 in the availability of care category and 7 in the human resources category, there is a lack of robust indicators to evaluate the care given to dying patients, hampering audit and comparisons between services.

 Henceforth, this indicates the need and importance for good process and outcome indicators to be in place within healthcare settings.

 Based on the international evidence base, a set of core principles for care of the dying has been defined.

 These principles are applicable to the care of dying cancer patients, as well as other patients, worldwide.

 Several of the partners of the present consortium have led local, regional or national initiatives to improve care for dying cancer patients, especially by the use of integrated care plans applying these core international principles for care.

 In order to ensure the highest quality of care provisions, one needs to first be able to robustly evaluate the current quality of care.

 One method, as recommended by the End of Life Care Strategy within the United Kingdom, is to assess this from the user-perspective by conducting bereaved relatives' surveys.

 As such, bereaved relatives' evaluations (both by surveys and telephone interviews) have formed a key aspect in evaluation of end-of-life care in many countries, especially within North America, and parts of Europe.

 'Care Of the Dying Evaluation' Questionnaire One such post-bereavement questionnaire is 'Care Of the Dying Evaluation' (CODE) (Appendix 1).

 This is a 42-item self-completion questionnaire, developed within the UK, and focused on the quality of care and the level of support provided to individuals and their families in the last days of life and the immediate post-bereavement period.

 In the UK, the NHS Friends and Family Test has also been included as an additional question within this questionnaire.

 CODE represents a shortened and more user-friendly version of the original instrument, 'Evaluating Care and Health Outcomes - for the Dying' (ECHO-D).

 ECHO-D has been used with over 700 bereaved relatives within a hospice and hospital setting and shown to be valid, reliable and sensitive in detecting inequalities in care and areas of unmet need.

 Both these instruments are unique from other post-bereavement questionnaires as they specifically link with the key components representing best practice for 'care of the dying' in the last days of life.

 ECHO-D was revised and shortened, and the 'key quality indicator' questions (based on validity and reliability measures as well as clinical importance) were used to form CODE.

 These questions include: aspects of symptom control; communication; nursing and medical care; provision of fluids; place of death; emotional and spiritual support.

 CODE has been used and validated with bereaved relatives to patients who died in their own home.

 The validation process included: undertaking cognitive 'think aloud' interviews to assess face and content validity; assessing CODE's stability over time by conducting test-retest reliability analysis; and assessing the construct validity and internal consistency of three key composite scales within CODE.

 The three composite scales that exist within CODE represent the conceptual themes environment, care and communication.

 In addition, CODE contains four key composite variables representing groups of questions which have similar important conceptual themes and nominal response options: symptom control, symptom management, spiritual needs and unmet information needs.

 Subsequently, CODE has been used within the context of the National Care of the Dying Audit - Hospitals which was led by the Royal College of Physicians; and within Merseyside and Cheshire as part of a quality assurance and benchmarking process to evaluate Care of the Dying across hospices, hospitals and community settings.

 Additionally, prior to the present project, there have been six requests for CODE to be used internationally, and over 40 requests for use within the UK healthcare setting.

 In Work Package 1 of the present project, CODE was translated from English into the main language of each partner country according to established international procedures, and pilot tested in volunteers and bereaved relatives to assure understanding and appropriate cultural adaptation.

 Based on feedback from the testing in each country, a common, international version of CODE (iCODE) has been established through a consensus procedure.

 All partners have signed a Material Transfer Agreement for the use of CODE in the present project.

 AIMS & OBJECTIVES The present project (Work Package 2) aims to advance the international evidence in care for dying patients by undertaking an observational study of bereaved relatives' views across seven participating countries, by use of the CODE questionnaire.

 The overall aims of Work Package 2 (WP2) are: - Conduct an international survey of bereaved relatives of cancer patients dying in hospitals, using the CODE questionnaire - Conduct a web survey of all participating institutions to aid in the interpretation of the survey data - Use the CODE data to provide feedback about the quality of care and level of family support at an international and national level, allowing for cross-country comparisons The aims will be achieved by the following objectives: - Recruit the sufficient number of hospitals caring for adult cancer patients as study sites - Recruit at least 100 bereaved relatives as study participants in each country.

 (Due to expected response rates for these types of bereaved surveys, the investigators are anticipating that up to 3-4 times as many questionnaires will need to be disseminated to bereaved relatives.

 The expected response rate is also depending on the method of recruitment, as generally more persons respond to a personal invitation than to a letter in the post.

) - Establish feasible and effective procedures for CODE data collection in each country - Establish safe and effective methods for transfer of study data to a common database - Develop an online survey for mapping information for all participating hospitals - Analyse the CODE data using the CODE user guide and appropriate statistical methods - Interpret the data in view of the organisation and level of palliative care provision at each site / in each country METHODS Study sites The necessary number of hospitals caring for adult cancer patients will be recruited as study sites.

 The study will only be performed in institutions defined as hospitals (not hospices, nursing homes or other care institutions, nor home care services).

 Any type of hospital caring for adult cancer patients may be used: local, central, or regional hospitals, providing secondary and/or tertiary care, with or without a palliative care inpatient unit, with public or private funding.

 Definitions: - Next-of-kin: Defined by the patient and recorded in the patient's hospital record.

 It may be any family relation or friend, neighbour, warden, etc.

 - Expected death: If not possible to check with attending physician: any cancer patient who died in hospital and was not resuscitated the last day of life - Cancer patient: Any patient with a cancer diagnosis (histologically or radiologically verified), not necessarily dying from the cancer.

 Solid tumours as well as haematological malignancies count as cancer.

 Recruitment The relative / next-of-kin must be approached after the patient's death.

 The investigators will approach the person recorded as next-of-kin in the patient's hospital record.

 Only one completed questionnaire will be included per deceased patient, but it may be completed by more than one relative, or by somebody else than the one recorded as next-of-kin.

 Recruitment will be done prospectively.

 However, in the UK, recruitment will also be done retrospectively to be able to reach the desired number of participants, but will be limited to 8 weeks post bereavement.

 The method of recruitment will be adapted as to what is feasible and in the individual country.

 Potential participants will be approached face to face, by telephone or in writing and invited to complete the CODE questionnaire.

 DATA COLLECTION CODE International Survey Data to be collected The CODE questionnaire is the common data collection tool of the study.

 It is described in the Background section above.

 The demographic data included in CODE are the following (all information provided by the participant): Participant: - Relation to the patient - Age (in groups) - Ethnic group - Gender - Religious affiliation Patient: - Illnesses in the last days and hours of life - Age (in groups) - Ethnic group - Gender - Religious affiliation In addition, the following information will be included for all cases, as part of the inclusion procedure: - The patient's length of stay in the hospital - Type of ward the patient died on (general medical or surgical ward, oncology ward, ICU, emergency ward, palliative care unit) - The patient's cancer type (predefined groups) - Whether or not the specialist palliative care team was involved in the care (for patients not dying in a palliative care unit) - Whether or not an individual care plan for the dying phase was used Length of stay, type of ward, cancer type, involvement of the specialist palliative care team, use of an individualised care plan as well as age (groups) and gender of the patient and next-of-kin will be recorded for all eligible cases, included and non-included, to be able to subsequently judge whether the sample is representative of the population as a whole.

 Depending on national regulations, this may require special permission.

 If any of the partners want to include additional items or questionnaires, they are free to do so, provided the necessary approvals are obtained and the add-ons do not negatively influence participation in the main study.

 Method of data collection The CODE questionnaire will be sent to the participants 6-8 weeks post bereavement.

 If not returned, one reminder will be sent, four weeks after the first attempt.

 CODE International Survey was intended as a postal survey.

 However, due to poorly functioning postal services, illiteracy, lack of experience with postal questionnaires or very low response rates in several of the participating countries (South America), other data collection methods (data entry online, face to face interviews and telephone interviews) will also be accepted.

 Poland intends to use computer-assisted personal interviewing using tablets (CAPI; the computer displays the questions on screen, the interviewer reads them to the respondent, and then enters the respondent's answers).

 If CODE is to be completed by the participant in writing, they may have the choice between paper and an electronic version.

 They will receive a letter with the paper version of CODE and a fully self-addressed (or prepaid) envelope, but the letter may also say where they can log on to complete the electronic version, depending on the ethical and data protection stipulations in each country.

 The paper questionnaire will be marked with the unique identifier code when sent out.

 When answering online, the participants themselves must enter their identifier code.

 Sample estimation The aim is to have at least 100 completed CODE questionnaires per country.

 Sample estimation: Minimum acceptable number of questionnaires per country is 100 (with this number, a 95% confidence interval will give a margin of error of +/- 10% of the primary outcome).

 There is no maximum acceptable number of questionnaires per country as increasing response rates only will diminish the margin of error and increase the accuracy of the results.

 Data transfer The electronic version and database for CODE for each country/language will be developed in Norway using the Corporate Surveyor software.

 There will be one database for each country.

 Participants entering their data online will enter them directly into the database.

 For paper questionnaires, either filled in by the participants themselves or by interview, the CODE data will be entered into the database by local project co-workers.

 The databases will be merged in Norway for the final common analyses.

 Data from Corporate Surveyor may be transferred directly to SPSS or other statistics tools.

 As some analyses of the survey data may be conducted by other consortium partners, consent/approval for data transfer is included in the information sheet for survey participants and the ethics application.

 Web survey of study sites Data to be collected In order to provide contextual information for the results of CODE International Survey of bereaved relatives, information will be gathered about each organisation (hospital) and their palliative care provision.

 The following information will be collected: - Type of hospital - categories - Number of beds in hospital; number of beds in included wards - Public/private; if private, profit-oriented or idealistic - Deaths per year - Deaths from cancer per year - Palliative care unit in the hospital - yes/no - Advisory specialist palliative care team - yes/no - Outpatient specialist palliative care clinic - yes/no - Palliative care daycare unit - yes/no - Structured bereavement service - yes/no - Chaplaincy - yes/no - Physicians, nurses, physiotherapists specialized in palliative care - EOL care implemented in hospital's 'mission statement' - Integrated care plan for the dying implemented - yes/no - Level of oncological expertise (comprehensive cancer centre, oncological centre; clear definitions must be given) ('not applicable' included as answer option) - Code status defined/identified - Opioid access / policy Method of data collection and transfer The web survey of study sites will be developed using the Corporate Surveyor software.

 There will be one questionnaire to be used by all participating institutions across all seven countries, and the answers will be entered into one common database.

 The questionnaire will be developed and answered in English.

 DATA ANALYSIS Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical package.

 Initial data analysis of response rates and demographic details will be conducted using descriptive statistics (proportions (%) for categorical data; means and standard deviations for continuous parametric data and medians and interquartile range for continuous non-parametric data).

 A comparison of demographic details for participants and non-respondents will be conducted to assess how representative our sample is compared to the potential population as a whole.

 Pearson X2 statistic will be used for categorical data, independent sample t-testing for continuous parametric data and Mann-Whitney U for continuous non-parametric data.

 The dataset, anonymised at patient, site and country level, will be aggregated at international level to enable an international report.

 Results will be summarised in tabular and graphical format, as appropriate.

 ERANet-LAC CODE: International Care Of the Dying Evaluation@highlight

Providing high quality care for dying patients and their families is very important.

 One way one can assess the care provided is to ask bereaved relatives to complete a questionnaire after their family member has died.

 The questionnaire can ask about their experiences and their thoughts about the care provided to their family member.

 One such questionnaire is the 'Care Of the Dying Evaluation' (or CODE).

 CODE has been developed with the help and support of bereaved relatives and has been used extensively within the United Kingdom.

 In this project the investigators want to use the CODE questionnaire to look at bereaved relatives' views about care provided in seven different countries within Europe and Latin America.

 In the first part of the project CODE was translated into the main language of each country.

 Volunteers and bereaved relatives in each country were asked to give feedback about whether CODE was easy to understand, sensitive, and easy to complete.

 Based on the feedback a common version of CODE that is suitable for use across all the countries was developed.

 In the next phase of the project, relatives who have recently experienced a bereavement where one of their family members has died from cancer in a hospital, will be invited to complete the CODE questionnaire about two months after the patient's death.

 The relatives may complete CODE on paper, using a computer, or by interview.

 The aim is to have 100 completed CODE questionnaires from each of the seven countries.

 The data from the questionnaires will be used to make a report on the current quality of care for dying cancer patients in hospitals across the seven countries.

 It will also be possible to compare the care between the countries and identify areas needing improvement.

 In the next phase of the project, health care professionals, researchers and bereaved relatives together will use their knowledge and experience to find effective ways to improve the weak areas identified, and assess the results of putting these changes into practice.
