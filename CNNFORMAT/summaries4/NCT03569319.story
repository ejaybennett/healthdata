(fifthQuint)Tailored Mediterranean Lifestyle Education in Participants With Subjective Cognitive Impairment.

 This pilot RCT aims to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based, tailored Mediterranean lifestyle education intervention (THINK-MED) to encourage behaviour change among participants who have subjective cognitive impairment.

 This study will be a 6 month randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a total of 30 participants who will be randomised to 1 of 3 groups: 1.

 Group 1 will receive the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory resource on one occasion at baseline (n=10) 2.

 Group 2 will receive the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory resource at monthly intervals for 5 months, with an initial face-to-face visit from the research dietitian (month 1) and accompanied by telephone feedback (month 2-5) (n=10) 3.

 Group 3 is a control group.

 Participants in this group will receive the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory resource after completing the 6 month study (n=10).

It is estimated that 30% of Alzheimer's disease cases globally are associated with changeable risk factors, such as diet and physical activity.

 In particular, a Mediterranean diet (MD) has been associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline and improved brain function.

 The investigators developed educational resources on the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle (THINK-MED) in accordance with the Medical Research Council guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions, based on a systematic literature review and informed by qualitative work with patients with mild memory problems.

The feedback gathered informed refinements and tailoring of the resource and overall MD intervention.

 This study aims to evaluate feasibility of the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean lifestyle educational intervention to encourage dietary behaviour change among community-dwelling people with subjective cognitive impairment.
