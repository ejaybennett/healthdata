(firstQuint)Building Stronger Allies.

 The investigators have focused on the identification of malleable risk factors for preventative intervention in a number of types of psychopathology including suicidality.

 In the case of Perceived Burdensomeness (PB) and Thwarted Belongingness (TB), theory suggests that they may be malleable, though this has received little empirical attention.

 Taken together, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and related empirical literature suggest that targeting PB/TB should offer a novel and important avenue to reduce suicidality.

 This inspired the investigators' efforts to create and evaluate an intervention - called Building Stronger Allies (BSA) - designed to reduce these factors.
