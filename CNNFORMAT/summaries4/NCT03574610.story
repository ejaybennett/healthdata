(fifthQuint)Brain Targets in Patients With Bladder Emptying Difficulties.

 Difficulty in bladder emptying (Voiding dysfunction,VD) is a costly urinary condition that leads to urinary tract infections/stones, sepsis, bladder loss, and permanent kidney damage.

 VD can be present in patients with or without neurologic/brain disorders.

 Currently the only available therapies for VD include bladder catheters or intermittent self-catheterization.

 Catheterization is a burden especially in patients with nerve damage, hand skills may be limited.

 The cost and morbid side effects of catheterizations in patients (blood in the urine, pain, trauma, strictures, and infections) requires us to develop new therapies that are beyond the bladder.

 Such newtherapies could target the brain (where bladder control is located).

 In this proposal, we plan to further characterize the brain regions involved in bladder emptying for each patient and ,perform brain modulation, targeting these regions as a possible therapy for VD.

 Patients with bladder dysfunction will be divided into two groups: Group 1: patients with VD; and Group 2: patients without VD.

 Specific Aim 1: We will evaluate brain pattern in both groups and compare them to each other at the time of bladder emptying.

 Specific Aim 2: We will evaluate reliability of the nerve fibers in the brain and see whether damage to these fibers is related to difficulty emptying the bladder.

 Specific Aim 3: We will perform non-invasive brain stimulation on specific regions of the brain responsible for bladder control to improve bladder emptying.

 This study is an interventional Study: We have completed a well-powered study, on twenty-seven female MS patients during their bladder storage phase.

 Aims 1 and 2 use the data from our previously completed trial and we will perform additional imaging analysis on it.

 Aim 3 is a new and small trial where we plan to modulate the regions of the brain that are related to bladder control.

 Approximately 16 study participants will be enrolled at Houston Methodist, and 16 throughout the study.

 Brain Targets in Patients With Bladder Emptying Difficulties@highlight

The goal of this study is to identify brain centers specifically associated with "initiation of voiding" in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

 Currently there is no study that has evaluated brain centers involved in initiation of voiding in patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction.

 Patients with neurogenic bladder secondary to etiologies such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Cerebrovascular accidents will be recruited in this study.

 Patients will be categorized into 2 groups, those who have trouble emptying their bladder and those who urinate appropriately.

 Our existing and unique functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)/ urodynamics (UDS) platform is an ideal platform to identify brain regions involved in bladder emptying disorders as seen in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction and will be used for this study.

 After characterizing brain regions involved in bladder emptying, we propose to use noninvasive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation in a subset of patients with voiding dysfunction in our aim 3.
