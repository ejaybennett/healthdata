(fifthQuint)A Randomised Controlled Trial of Coenzyme Q10 in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 Coenzyme-Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron-transport-chain in addition to being a potent lipophilic antioxidant.

 Deficits in CoQ10 status have been linked to cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, fatigue, and depression.

 CoQ10 supplementation may have a potential therapeutic value for patients with schizophrenia.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial that will compare neurocognitive performance and symptoms of schizophrenia in participants randomised to active CoQ10 compared to scores from participants who received placebo.

 CoQ10 will be administered at a dose of 300mg/day, delivered in 3 doses of 100mg each.

 Participants will take CoQ10/placebo for 6 months.

 At three time points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months) each participant completes a neurocognitive and psychological battery of assessments.

 Blood pressure is monitored, and blood samples to assess mitochondrial function and plasma CoQ10 status are taken at each assessment.

 A Randomised Controlled Trial of Coenzyme Q10 in Patients With Schizophrenia@highlight

The study is a randomised placebo controlled trial of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) vitamin supplementation in a sample of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

 CoQ10 is produced in the mitochondria of our cells, and is involved in the production of energy.

 However, some people do not produce enough CoQ10, which can result in difficulties with concentration and memory, depressive symptoms, low energy levels and high blood pressure.

 The study will examine the impact of taking oral CoQ10 supplementation on patients with schizophrenia.
