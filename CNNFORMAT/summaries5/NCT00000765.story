(fifthQuint)Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Zidovudine in Preventing CD4+ Lymphocyte Decline in Patients With Primary HIV Infection.

 (One Treatment Arm Receives Placebo).

 Previous studies indicate that intervention with zidovudine during primary HIV infection could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions, and could prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic antiretroviral therapy.

 Patients are randomized to receive either zidovudine or placebo daily for 24 weeks.

 Patients are followed until development of an AIDS-related opportunistic infection or malignancy.

 After week 24, patients meeting standard prescribing criteria may start FDA-approved anti-HIV therapies.

 After study week 48, patients may co-enroll on another clinical trial to receive experimental therapy.

 Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Zidovudine in Preventing CD4+ Lymphocyte Decline in Patients With Primary HIV Infection.

 (One Treatment Arm Receives Placebo)@highlight

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of early treatment with zidovudine for preventing a decline in CD4+ lymphocyte counts in patients with primary HIV infection.

 To determine the natural history of virologic and immunologic changes in primary HIV infection.

 Previous studies indicate that intervention with zidovudine during primary HIV infection could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions, and could prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic antiretroviral therapy.
