(fifthQuint)Dexamethasone in Cryptococcal Meningitis.

 In AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, a correlation has been found between early death and elevated intracranial pressure.

 Since dexamethasone has been found to reduce intracranial pressure resulting from other forms of meningitis, it may be of benefit in AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

 Patients are randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo every 6 hours for 72 hours (days 1 through 3).

 Additionally, standard antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine is given for 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole for 8 weeks.

 Lumbar punctures will be performed daily on days 1 through 3, on days 7 and 14, and at week 10.
