(fifthQuint)Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the safety of immunization with HLA class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in patients with prostate carcinoma.

 II.

 Evaluate the antitumor effects of this treatment as assessed by post-therapy declines in PSA.

 III.

 Evaluate the induction of cellular and humoral immunity in vivo with this treatment.

 OUTLINE: Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy.

 Immunization with irradiated, MHC class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP cells, engineered to secrete approximately 58 ng/24 hr/million cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and approximately 0.

72 U/24 hr/million cells of interferon gamma (IFN-G).

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 12 patients will be entered on the Phase I study; accrual will continue to a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD (Phase II).

 Accrual is expected to require 2 years.

 Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells including natural killer cells to kill prostate cancer cells.

 Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells.

 Combining interferon gamma with interleukin-2 may be a more effective treatment for prostate cancer.

 PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy using interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer.
