(thirdQuint)Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Compared With Epirubicin and Paclitaxel in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the activity and toxicity of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with that of epirubicin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to receive either epirubicin and cyclophosphamide or epirubicin and paclitaxel.

 Each drug combination is given every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 704 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with epirubicin and paclitaxel in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.
