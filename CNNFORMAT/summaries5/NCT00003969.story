(secondQuint)Geldanamycin Analogue in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose for a geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), in patients with advanced malignancies.

 - Determine the toxic effects and dose-limiting toxicity of AAG in this patient population.

 - Determine the safe dose of AAG for a Phase II study.

 - Measure the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of AAG in these patients.

 - Assess time to tumor progression and any antitumor activity in patients treated with AAG.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive a geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), IV over 15-30 minutes every week.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a geldanamycin analogue in treating patients with advanced cancer.
