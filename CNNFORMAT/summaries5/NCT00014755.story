(thirdQuint)Phase I Pilot Study of Total-Body Irradiation, Anti-Thymocyte Globulin and Cyclophosphamide Followed By Syngeneic or Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral prednisone on days 0-10.

 Beginning on day 1, patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until leukapheresis is completed.

 Leukapheresis begins on approximately day 4 and continues until adequate CD34+ PBSC are collected.

 PBSC are collected from syngeneic donors in a similar manner.

 Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily on days -5 and -4.

 Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5.

 Patients undergo autologous or syngeneic PBSC transplantation on day 0.

 Following PBSC transplantation, patients receive oral prednisone on days 7-30 and G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

 Patients are followed at 30, 80, and 90 days, monthly for 6 months, and then at 1 and 2 years.

 Phase I Pilot Study of Total-Body Irradiation, Anti-Thymocyte Globulin and Cyclophosphamide Followed By Syngeneic or Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the toxicity of total-body irradiation, anti-thymocyte globulin, and cyclophosphamide followed by syngeneic or autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in patients with multiple sclerosis.

 II.

 Determine the disease response of patients treated with this regimen.

 III.

 Determine the safety and efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) for PBSC mobilization in this patient population.
