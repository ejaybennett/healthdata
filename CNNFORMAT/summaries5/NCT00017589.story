(fifthQuint)Oblimersen and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Treating Older Patients With Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the complete response rate of elderly patients with relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia treated with oblimersen and gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

 - Determine the overall response rate and duration of response of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and 15-22 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on days 4 and 18.

 Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Oblimersen may help gemtuzumab ozogamicin kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen and gemtuzumab ozogamicin in treating older patients who have relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
