 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the antitumor activity of bortezomib in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

 II.

 Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive bortezomib IV twice weekly for 2 weeks.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
