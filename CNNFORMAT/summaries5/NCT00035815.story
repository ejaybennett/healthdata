(thirdQuint)Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Trial.

 The objective of this trial was to determine whether IGF-1 (MyotrophinTM) slows progression of weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

 Three hundred thirty patients with ALS from 20 medical centers participated in this double blind, placebo-controlled two-year study.

 Half the patients received IGF-1 and the other half received placebo.

 The drug will be administered twice a day.

 ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor neurons.

 IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor essential for normal development of the nervous system and shows protection of motor neurons in animal models and cell culture systems.

 It is thought to block cell death pathways and promote muscle re-innervation and axonal growth and regeneration.

 Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Trial@highlight

The purpose of this multicenter study is to determine if insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) slows the progressive weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.

 Study participants will be followed for 2 years once enrolled.

 They will receive either placebo or the active IGF-I.

 Examinations will take place at approximately 6-month intervals.
