(thirdQuint)Radiation Therapy in Preventing Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival after effective locoregional/systemic therapy in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

 - Determine the neuropsychologic impact of this therapy in these patients.

 - Assess quality of life of patients receiving this therapy.

 - Determine the impact of this therapy on the incidence of CNS metastases in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB), histology (non-squamous cell vs squamous cell), and prior surgery (yes vs no).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 3 weeks.

 - Arm II: Patients undergo observation.

 Patients are followed 3 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2-3 years and then annually thereafter.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,058 patients (529 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 36 months.

 Radiation Therapy in Preventing Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 It is not yet known if giving radiation therapy to the head is effective in preventing CNS metastases in patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy to the head works in preventing CNS metastases in patients who have been previously treated for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
