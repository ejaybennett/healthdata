(secondQuint)Evaluation of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Targretin Capsules in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 This study evaluates the use of Targretin capsules (bexarotene) in combination with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy for their lung cancer.

 Every patient receives a platinum-containing chemotherapy every three weeks for at least four chemotherapy cycles (approximately four months).

 Half of the patients are randomly assigned to receive Targretin capsules once daily in addition to the chemotherapy.

 The other half is randomized to receive a standard platinum-containing chemotherapy without Targretin capsules.
