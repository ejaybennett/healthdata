(secondQuint)Topotecan in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose and duration of prolonged topotecan as maintenance in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with complete clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive oral topotecan twice daily for 21 days.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

 Patients who tolerate course 1 may receive an escalated dose of topotecan for subsequent courses.

 The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose tolerated by the majority of the patients.

 Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 6 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating patients who have advanced ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
