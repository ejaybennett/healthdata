(thirdQuint)Oxidative Stress and Vitamin E Requirements.

 We will be investigating the fractional disappearance rate of tocopherols in cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers.

 This will be accomplished by supplementing individuals with deuterium labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherols.

 Quantification of plasma tocopherols as well as urinary metabolites, alpha- and gamma-carboxy ethyl hydroxychromanol, will be determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.

 In addition, the role of vitamin C as it pertains to its influence on the fraction disappearance rate of vitamin E will also be evaluated.

 Oxidative Stress and Vitamin E Requirements@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if oxidative stress derived from cigarette smoking increases vitamin E requirements.

 The study will also assess the role of vitamin C in modulating vitamin E requirements.

 Vitamin E requirements will be assessed by measuring vitamin E in plasma as well as by measuring the excreted vitamin E metabolite in the urine.
