(thirdQuint)DJ-927 as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with DJ-927 as second-line treatment.

 Secondary - Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the median survival time in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to prior first-line treatment regimen (irinotecan-containing vs oxaliplatin-containing).

 Patients receive oral DJ-927* on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 NOTE: *Patients receive 1 of 2 selected doses to confirm the previously established maximum tolerated dose Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-62 patients (28-31 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.

 DJ-927 as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as DJ-927, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well DJ-927 works as second-line therapy in treating patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (cancer).
