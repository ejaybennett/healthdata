(thirdQuint)Epothilone D in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of epothilone D, in terms of confirmed objective response rate, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer who failed prior initial platinum-containing chemotherapy.

 Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the response duration in patients who achieve complete response or partial response, time to tumor progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug.

 - Compare the power associated with the estimated treatment effect of this drug in these patients vs standard treatment.

 - Correlate efficacy and safety with plasma concentrations of this drug and its major metabolites in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

 Patients receive epothilone D IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33-85 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Epothilone D in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epothilone D, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epothilone D works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy.
