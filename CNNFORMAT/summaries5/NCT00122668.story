(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Occurrence of Lipoatrophy in HIV-1 Infected Naive Patients.

 The study compare the rate of occurrence of lipoatrophy in ARVnaive HIV-1 infected patients receiving either a NRTI-sparing antiretroviral therapy with NRTI and boosted PI,or a standard antiretroviral therapy with 2 NRTI plus PI or NNRTI.

 Patients were randomized (2:1:1) to either PI+NNRTI (Gp1) or standard therapy, 2NRTI+ either PI (Gp2) or + NNRTI (Gp3).

 The study-treatment were lopinavir/r 100/400mg bid or indinavir/r 100/400mg bid for PI-class, for NNRTI-class, efavirenz or nevirapine and all NRTIs except D4T and DDC at usual dosage.

 Lipoatrophy is evaluated by evolution of subcutaneous fat in the limbs measured by DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)and CT-scan of the thighs between baseline and W96.

 Evaluation of the Occurrence of Lipoatrophy in HIV-1 Infected Naive Patients@highlight

The aim of this randomized study is to compare the occurrence of lipoatrophy in HIV-1 infected, naive patients receiving either a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing antiretroviral therapy with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and boosted protease inhibitor (PI), or a standard antiretroviral therapy with 2 NRTI plus either PI or NNRTI.

 Lipoatrophy is evaluated by measurement of fat volume by computed tomography (CT)-scan and DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry).
