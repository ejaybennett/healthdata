(secondQuint)Bone Marrow Stem Cell Mobilisation Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)(REVIVAL-2).

 Experimental studies and early-phase clinical trials suggest that transplantation of blood-derived or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells may improve cardiac regeneration after acute myocardial infarction.

 Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces mobilization of bone marrow stem cells and, thereby, increases the number of circulating stem cells that are available cells for myocardial regeneration.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether stem cell mobilization by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction after successful mechanical reperfusion reduces infarct size.
