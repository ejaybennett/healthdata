(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Preventing AIDS Through Live Movement and Sound (PALMS) Intervention for Minority Adolescents.

 Philadelphia Health Management Corporation (PHMC) is evaluating the Preventing AIDS Through Live Movement and Sound (PALMS) group-level intervention for high-risk, incarcerated or adjudicated youth.

 PALMS uses three theater-based sessions to increase knowledge about HIV/AIDS, increase HIV testing, and reduce risky sexual behavior through increased self-efficacy.

 The intervention is delivered by peers, and peers work with the intervention team to use evaluation results to improve the program.

 The evaluation will recruit male adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years, who are residing in juvenile justice or drug treatment facilities in Philadelphia.

 The evaluation design uses concurrent intervention (N=132) and comparison (N=132) groups.

 Data will be collected at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and at a 6-month post-intervention follow-up.

 The intent of this program is to support the evaluation of an existing intervention and provide feedback to the implementing organization for improved program effectiveness, not to conduct research.
