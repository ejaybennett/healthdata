(fifthQuint)Navrongo Drug Options for IPT in Pregnancy Trial.

 Background Pregnant women, particularly during the first and second pregnancy, have a high risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection and these infections are often asymptomatic but lead to maternal anaemia and low birth-weight.

 One approach to preventing malaria in pregnancy is prompt effective management of clinical malaria.

 In areas of moderate and high transmission however, peripheral parasitaemia is not a sensitive indicator as many women with placental parasitaemia may not have peripheral parasitaemia.

 Another option is to administer full curative doses of an effective antimalarial drug at predefined intervals during pregnancy (IPTp) without screening for parasitaemia.

 The efficacy of IPTp has been studied mostly in areas of high perennial transmission in Kenya and Malawi.

 IPTp has however been little investigated in West Africa where transmission is often intense and highly seasonal.

 It may not be appropriate to translate results between areas with different ranges of transmission intensities across the sub-Saharan African region and there is a need to study the effect of IPTp in highly seasonal intense transmission areas in West Africa.

 IPTp with SP has been shown to be effective in reducing maternal anaemia, prevalence of placental parasitaemia and the incidence of low birth weight.

 SP offers a reasonable combination of ease of use and associated increased compliance, low cost, and relatively good tolerance and safety.

 However, the useful therapeutic life (UTL) predicted for SP is likely to be short, in part due to its prolonged half-life, causing a higher probability of selecting resistant strains and consequent rapid development of resistance.

 The emergence and spread of SP resistance will increasingly undermine this strategy, depleting the currently available and affordable drugs usable for intervention during pregnancy.

 It is therefore important that alternative antimalarials that are safe and effective in pregnancy are identified.

 Specific primary objective To assess and compare the efficacy of a combination of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine used as IPTp, in reducing the incidence of anaemia(Hb 37weeks and birthweight is 2500g Withdrawal from study A withdrawal shall be any enrolled subject who does not complete the study as planned.

 This may be due to (a) withdrawal of consent, (b) reaction attributable to any of the study drugs or (c) termination of pregnancy (abortions or miscarriages).

 A withdrawal form shall be filled for such persons, indicating reasons for withdrawal, and they will be followed up for outcome measures, unless they decline to give consent.

 Navrongo Drug Options for IPT in Pregnancy Trial@highlight

In areas of stable transmission, pregnant women, especially during the first and second pregnancies, have an increased susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, malaria-related anaemia and an increased risk of having low birthweight babies.

 Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy(IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has been shown to be effective in reducing the effects of malaria in pregnancy.

 This has mainly been in areas of perennial transmission and there is a need to study this effect in intense seasonal transmission settings.

 The emergence and spread of resistance to SP is likely to undermine its useful lifespan and it is important that other antimalarials that are safe and effective are identified for use in IPTp.

 The options are however limited.

 Amodiaquine has been shown to be effective in treatment of clinical cases of malaria, even in areas where chloroquine resistance is prevalent, and its combination with SP has been associated with favourable results.

 Both are affordable.

 However, there is limited data on their use in pregnancy.

 This study aims to assess the efficacy of SP in an area of intense seasonal transmission, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of amodiaquine and a combination of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine as possible alternatives to SP for use as IPTp.
