(secondQuint)LEAN Project: Weight Loss and Appetite Suppression.

 Participants will be randomized to either a control or treatment group taking the dietary supplement containing a soy lecithin-derived N-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (NOPE) and caffeine free Green Tea-derived epigallocathchin gallate (EGCG) whose trade name is PhosphoLean.

 The outcome is to determine the effects on indices of weight loss and appetite suppression.

 Participants will return at 6, 12, and 16 weeks for clinical measures.
