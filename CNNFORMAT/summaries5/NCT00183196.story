The purpose of this study is to determine whether, after a period of abstinence, adding 6 weeks of gabapentin (a medication approved to treat seizures) to a standard 16-week naltrexone (an opiate blocking agent approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence) treatment protocol is helpful in decreasing relapse to drinking compared to naltrexone alone or placebo.

 All participants will receive alcohol counseling.
