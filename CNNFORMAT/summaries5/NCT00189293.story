The purpose of this study is to compare the recurrence rate following total clearance of external genital warts (EGWs) when clearance has been obtained by imiquimod (3 applications per week for 4 weeks) followed by ablative therapy (laser or electrocautery therapy) with that from just ablative therapy treatment alone.
