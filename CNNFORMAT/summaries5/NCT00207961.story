(firstQuint)The Threshold Value of Regional Cerebral Oxygenation in Detecting Cerebral Ischemia.

 56 patients has been recruited for the analysis of relationship between the symptoms of cerebral ischemia and the value of cerebral oximeter.

 All patients were recieved spinal anesthesia for the procedure of Ceserean section.
