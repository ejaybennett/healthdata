(thirdQuint)Phase I/II Study of Paclitaxel Plus CPT-11 in Pts.

 With 2nd Line Chemotherapy of Inoperable or Recurrent GC.

.

 Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic gastric cancer were included in this trial.

 Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression disease.

 Starting dose (dose level 1) were CPT-11 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15, Paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and 15.

 DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.

0); Grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia(25000), Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (>38) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomit, appetite loss , general fatigue, alopecia).

 Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level.

 Response rate will be calculated according to RECIST criteria.

@highlight

A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using CPT-11 and Paclitaxel in pre-treated patients with metastatic gastric cancer.

 The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and progression free survival.
