(thirdQuint)A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Almotriptan Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Migraine Headache.

 Almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) is approved for the treatment of migraine headache, with or without aura, in adults.

 This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine headache, with or without aura.

 Patients will be randomized (like with the toss of a coin) to receive almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) or placebo for the treatment of 3 consecutive qualifying migraine headaches.

 After screening, patients will leave the study center with blinded study medication and an electronic subject diary (Personal Digital Assistant [PDA]).

 Patients will self-dose with study medication as soon as headache pain of any intensity begins (that resembles their usual migraine), but no later than 1 hour after headache pain begins.

 Patients will use their PDAs to record assessments such as pain intensity, symptom severity and ability to function as related to the headaches.

 The primary hypothesis of this study is that the percentage of patients who are pain free two hours after taking study drug at the earliest onset of headache pain is greater in the almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) 12.

5mg group than in the placebo group and almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) is generally well-tolerated.

 Almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) 12.

5 milligrams or placebo tablets, one by mouth at the beginning of migraine pain (within 1 hour) for 3 consecutive migraine headaches.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) 12.

5 milligram tablets compared with placebo for the acute treatment of migraine headache at the earliest onset of headache pain.

 Almotriptan malate (AXERT(R)) is approved for the treatment of migraine headache, with or without aura, in adults.

 Patients in this study will take either almotriptan or placebo oral tablets for 3 consecutive migraine headaches.
