(fifthQuint)Selenium in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Brachytherapy for Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effects of selenium vs placebo on tissue biomarkers of prostate cancer susceptibility, using tissue samples from biopsies before and after treatment, in patients undergoing brachytherapy for stage I or II prostate cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the effects of selenium on antioxidant enzyme activities in these patients.

 - Determine, preliminarily, whether there is a threshold effect among patients with low baseline levels of selenium treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium for 3-6 weeks.

 Patients then undergo brachytherapy.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo for 3-6 weeks.

 Patients then undergo brachytherapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months.

RATIONALE: The use of nutritional supplements, such as selenium, may stop prostate cancer from growing.

 Internal radiation, such as brachytherapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Giving selenium before brachytherapy may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying selenium to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating patients who are undergoing brachytherapy for stage I or stage II prostate cancer.
