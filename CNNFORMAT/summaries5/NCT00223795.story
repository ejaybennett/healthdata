(secondQuint)Walking Aids in the Management of Knee Osteoarthritis.

 Knee OA is an important cause of disability and falls in overweight or obese individuals and limits their attempts at exercise and subsequent weight loss.

 Walking aids such as canes have been recommended in the management of knee OA in order to decrease pain by reducing loading across the knee and to increase physical activity.

 Little information is available regarding the impact of walking aids on psychosocial function and quality of life in individuals with limited mobility.

 No randomized controlled trials have studied the efficacy of walking aids on quality of life, pain, and function in overweight or obese individuals with symptomatic knee OA (5,6).

 The proposed research will evaluate the effects of walking aids in knee OA by testing the following hypothesis that the use of a single-point cane ipsilateral and contralateral to the affected limb will decrease pain from knee OA by altering gait biomechanics and will improve walking function and quality of life in overweight or obese individuals with symptomatic knee OA.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether the single point cane will relieve pain and disability in overweight or obese people with knee OA through altered joint biomechanics and what factors influence acceptance of cane use.
