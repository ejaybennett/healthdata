(fifthQuint)TDI Preejection Velocities and Myocardial Viability.

 The objective of the project is to study clinical and prognostic value of new echocardiographic technique, so called positive preejection velocity (+VIC), in patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction indicated for revascularization.

 Pilot studies has shown high accuracy of pulsed Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)-derived resting pattern of +VIC to detect viable myocardium in patients with both acute myocardial infarction and chronically dysfunctional myocardium.

 The aim of the project is to test accuracy of +VIC to predict LV remodeling and long-term prognosis after revascularization in patients with chronically dysfunctional myocardium.

 Study population will consist of two groups of patients with stable ischemic LV dysfunction: group A- patients indicated for revascularization (n=200), group B- matched control group treated conservatively (case-control design) (n=100).

 All patients will be followed for 3 years.

 Endpoints include: 1) LV remodeling at 6 and 24 months and 2) MACE at 6, 12 and 36 months follow-up.

 Our hypothesis is that TDI-derived analysis of +VIC allows to select optimal responders to revascularization; it means individuals with the greatest benefit in terms of LV remodeling and long-term prognosis.

 TDI Preejection Velocities and Myocardial Viability@highlight

The purpose of the study is to test accuracy of positive preejection velocity to predict left ventricular remodeling and long-term prognosis after revascularization in 200 patients with chronically dysfunctional myocardium.

 Patients will be followed for 3 years.

 Our hypothesis is that tissue-Doppler-derived analysis of positive preejection velocity allows to select optimal responders to revascularization; it means individuals with the greatest benefit in terms of LV remodeling and long-term prognosis.
