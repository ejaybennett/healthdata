(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of rEV131 in Allergic Rhinitis.

 Hypothesis: rEV131, a histamine binding protein (derived from tick saliva) with an affinity for histamine 10 - 100 fold that of natural histamine receptors, might attenuate Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) induced allergic rhinitis.

 Methods: Patients with known ragweed allergy will be screened to determine the minimal threshold concentration (PD30) of pollen extract that consistently induces the four key symptoms of allergic rhinitis: itch, sneezing, congestion and mucus production.

 A standardised system of TNSS scoring will be used.

 A total of 112 eligible patients will be randomised in double blind fashion to receive one of four concentrations of rEV131 (0.

63, 1.

25, 2.

5 and 5.

0 mg/ml) by nasal spray 30 minutes prior to NAC or placebo.

 Symptoms will be scored at 15, 30 and 45 minutes post NAC.

 Mean sum of symptom scores of all active medication treated patients will be compared with those of placebo treated patients.

 The primary analysis will be the sum of scores at 15 minutes post challenge for the optimum concentration of rEV131.

 Secondary outcome variables will include comparison of individual symptom and percentage of patients having a clinically significant response.

 Safety and Efficacy Study of rEV131 in Allergic Rhinitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see whether rEV131 when given as a nasal spray in a single dose to each nostril is safe and can reduce the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) caused by an allergen challenge.

 All patients enrolled will be known to be allergic to ragweed pollen and will be given ragweed pollen extract in both nostrils 30 minutes after either rEV131 or innactive vehicle (placebo).

 The signs and symptoms (sneezing, itching, stuffiness and runny nose) will each be given a score from 0 to 3 by the patient and these will be added together and the combined scores from patients treated with rEV131 will be compared with those who received placebo.
