(secondQuint)Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis (EPIC).

 This project is a systematic, national study of incident IC cases and controls matched by age and gender.

 By telephone interview and medical record review, we compare exposures of cases and controls seeking significant differences which may be risk factors for IC.

 This cohort of incident IC cases will initiate a natural history study of the disease.

 Specific Aim 1.

 To test the hypothesis that certain features that precede onset of IC symptoms, e.

g.

, bacterial cystitis, distinguish IC cases from controls matched for age and gender, and may be risk factors for the disease.

 Specific Aim 2.

 To test the hypotheses that patients with IC have higher prevalences of certain non bladder syndromes, e.

g.

, irritable bowel syndrome, than do controls matched for age and gender.

 Specific Aim 3.

 To test the hypothesis that urine APF, HB EGF, and/or EGF are sensitive and specific diagnostic markers for IC in patients with symptoms of y12 months.

 Specific Aim 4.

 To test the hypotheses that, in an incident cohort, patients with IC have remissions and that certain clinical features, e.

g.

, bacterial cystitis at disease onset, are prognostic factors for remissions.

 Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis (EPIC)@highlight

EPIC is a case/control study that seeks to identify the risk factors for interstitial cystitis by comparing the experiences and medical histories of 400 women who recently developed IC with 400 similar people who do not have the disease.
