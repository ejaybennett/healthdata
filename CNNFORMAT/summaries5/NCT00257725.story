(firstQuint)Long Duration Stimulant Treatment Study of Preschoolers With ADHD-Feasibility Study.

 This is a single site, open-label, four-week feasibility study of long-duration beaded methylphenidate (B-MPH), also known as Ritalin LA cent .

 B-MPH is a FDA-approved medication for children 6 years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but there are no studies of its use in preschoolers.

 This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of B-MPH for ADHD treatment in 4-to-5-year old children.

 Total study duration is approximately 5 weeks.

 It includes a screening evaluation and 4 weeks of B-MPH treatment with doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg (based on the individual tolerability and efficacy).

 The study doctor will conduct parent-training sessions during the treatment visits.
