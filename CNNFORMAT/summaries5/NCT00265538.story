 Patients will be randomized to Pure control, intervention control, intervention group a, intervention group b or intervention group c.

 Pure control patients will not receive any study information about diuretics and their providers will not see any patients who receive our study intervention letter.

 Patients in the intervention control group will not receive the intervention but will see providers who have other patients in the intervention groups.

 Patients in intervention group a will receive a customized letter prior to their next primary care appointment with information regarding the patient's specific blood pressure, current blood pressure medication and recommendation for switching or adding a thiazide.

 Patients in group b will receive the customized intervention letter as well as a 20$ incentive for discussing the information with their provider and a copay reimbursement for 6 months if a prescription is written for a thiazide.

 Patients in group c will receive the intervention letter, 20$ discussion incentive, copay reimbursement as well as a phone call reminder 1-2 days prior to their primary care visit.
