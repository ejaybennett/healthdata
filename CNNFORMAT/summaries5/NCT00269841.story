(firstQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody in Patients With Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.

 This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated-dose study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease.

 The primary efficacy outcome of the study is the number of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of open fistulae observed for at least two consecutive evaluation visits.
