(thirdQuint)Phase II Comparator Study of Substitution of Tenofovir or Abacavir Receiving Thymidine Analogue as Part of HAART.

.

 A previous study substituting zidovudine or stavudine to abacavir in patients with severe or moderate lipoatrophy has shown an increase in limb fat (DEXA).

 This study was conducted over a 24 week period and although improved outcomes were documented by objective measures, DEXA scans, subjective observation did not correspond.

 Longer-term follow up of these patients is required.

 This 48 week study is designed to compare the substitution of the thymidine analogues zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (D4T) with either tenofovir DF or abacavir, in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and show improved outcomes on total limb fat mass, improved body shape by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT) scans and improved cholesterol and tryglicerides.
