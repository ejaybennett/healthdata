(fifthQuint)Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the efficacy and safety of a new dosing schedule and dosing level of docetaxel and cisplatin with the chemotherapy regimens used in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) in patients with completely resected stage IA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - Explore the relationship of time to recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival of these patients with levels of circulating DNA and proteomic analysis of serum.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

 Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 15.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving chemotherapy drugs after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with cisplatin works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.
