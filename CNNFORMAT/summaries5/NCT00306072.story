(secondQuint)Effect of Different Doses of Salacinol Extract on Glycemic and Insulinemic Response in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Although we have generated a good quantity of animal and human data on the salacinol extract, we have not explored the effect of the salacinol extract on postprandial glycemia or insulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 We planned to study 66 patients with diabetes in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three-treatment, crossover study.

 While in a fasted state, subjects were to consume one of the following three meals: a standard liquid meal containing 110 g carbohydrate, 18 g protein, 12 g fat, and 620 kilocalories (Control); Control plus 240 mg Salacia oblonga extract; and Control plus 480 mg Salacia oblonga extract.

 Postprandial serum glucose and serum insulin samples were to be analyzed for 180 min.
