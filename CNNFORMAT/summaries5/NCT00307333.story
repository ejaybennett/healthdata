(fifthQuint)Impact of Heart Rate Characteristics Monitoring in Neonates.

 Following randomization, infants will be managed as usual practice.

 The treating physicians of the HRC-display group will be able to utilize the HRC score to assist in the care of the infant.

 The physicians of the no-display group will provide care as per standard.

 Clinical symptoms will be treated according to the medical discretion of each physician.

 Cultures will be obtained and antibiotics administered as per the medical discretion of the physicians.

 Clinical, culture results, antibiotic administration, ventilator use, and outcome at 120 days data will be collected on the infants as well as their HRC score calculated by the HeRO heart rate characteristics monitor.

 Impact of Heart Rate Characteristics Monitoring in Neonates@highlight

Hypothesis: Fewer neonates managed using information from heart rate characteristics (HRC) will require intubation and mechanical ventilation as a result of sepsis and sepsis-like illness.

 Infants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 One group of infants will have the HRC index known to the physicians caring for them, and physicians will use the HRC index as they desire to aid in clinical management.

 Infants in the other group will have the HRC index recorded, but this information will not be displayed to the physicians caring for the infants.
