(firstQuint)PAD Combination Therapy Followed by Thal/Dex for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 Although the overall survival was improved with the introduction of high dose therapy with autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation,it remains as a incurable disease.

 Most patients ultimately relapse.

 Recenlty, targeted therapy using novel agents, such as bortezomib and thalidomide, shows the possibility of improved in this situation.

 PAD does not show any cross resiatance with another effective combination, thalidomide plus dexamethasone.

 We desined prospective multicenter phase 2 study using these combination sequentially.
