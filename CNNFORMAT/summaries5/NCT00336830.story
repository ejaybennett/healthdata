(fifthQuint)Improving Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation in Women and Men.

 There is compelling evidence that a comprehensive CR program comprising the delivery of lifestyle modifying education will reduce mortality, morbidity and improve quality of life in patients following myocardial infarction, angioplasty or, coronary artery bypass.

 However, less than 20% of eligible patients participate in CR programs.

 This study will look at a method of potentially improving enrollment and adherence to a CR program.

 It is expected that patients who receive the MD-endorsed referral will be more likely to attend the initial Orientation appointment and more closely adhere to the 6-month comprehensive CR program, as compared to the patients who receive a standard CR referral alone.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a pre-discharge written personal endorsement to the patient by the patient's attending cardiologist or cardiac surgeon (MD endorsement) to take part in the Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention (CR) program, in addition to the standard CR referral, compared to the standard CR referral alone, on CR program enrollment within 2 months of index hospital discharge following admission for myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass.
