(firstQuint)Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Rotigotine Nasal Spray for the Acute Treatment of RLS Symptoms.

 Each patient of the placebo and rotigotine group performed an Eligibility Assessment, as well 4 treatment days at which subjects performed a repeated 'Suggested Immobilization Test' (SIT) during a 30min pre-dose and a 4 hours post-dose period.

 During these periods the severity of RLS symptoms in the legs was assessed by the subject using a numeric symptom severity scale.

 In addition the leg movements were measured by actigraphy to assess the Periodic Leg Movement Index during Wakefulness (PLMWI, PLM per hour).

 Subjects applied a single dose of treatment on each treatment day (placebo nasal spray or rotigotine nasal spray in 3 ascending doses).
