(thirdQuint)Type 2 Diabetes and the Effect of Probiotics.

 Numerous studies have shown an association between insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes and chronic low-grade inflammation.

 Some probiotics have an anti-inflammatory properties.

 Ingestion of probiotics might therefore, due to this property, increase sensitivity to insulin.

 In this study type 2 diabetics (N=24) and healthy control (N=24) are given the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus NCFM for four weeks.

 The anti-inflammatory effect is examined by evaluating the inflammatory response (White blood cell count, plasma-cytokines) to an iv injection of endotoxin (0,3 ng/kg) before and after the intervention.

 Also the insulin-sensitivity is measured with an hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp before and after L.

 acidophilus NCFM.

 Type 2 Diabetes and the Effect of Probiotics@highlight

Insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes is associated with chronic inflammation.

 Anti-inflammatory actions might increase sensitivity to insulin.

 Since some probiotics have anti-inflammatory properties, ingestion of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus NCFM might increase insulin-sensitivity.

 The inflammatory response to endotoxin injection and the insulin-sensitivity is examined before and after four weeks ingestion of probiotics.
