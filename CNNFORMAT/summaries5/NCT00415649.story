(secondQuint)Safety of and Immune Response to an HIV DNA Plasmid Vaccine Followed by HIV Adenoviral Vector Vaccine in Healthy African Adults.

 Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS-related deaths have lessened in the United States.

 However, these therapies are widely inaccessible to the developing world.

 The need for a safe and affordable vaccine that will prevent HIV infection is of utmost importance.

 To generate a broadly protective vaccine, it is necessary to develop a multivalent vaccine containing a defined combination of immunogens from the most globally prevalent HIV subtypes.

 This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a multiclade HIV-1 DNA plasmid vaccine,VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a multiclade recombinant HIV-1 adenoviral vector vaccine, HIVADV014-00-VP.

 This study will last about 27 months.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 Group A will receive the DNA vaccine at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2, and the adenoviral vector vaccine at Month 6; Group B will receive placebo.

 There will be 20 study visits over 2 years.

 Physical exams, vital signs measurements, adverse event evaluation, and medical and medication history will occur at each visit.

 HIV testing and counseling and blood and urine collection will occur at selected visits.
