(thirdQuint)Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease.

 Despite bypass surgery has been considered as the standard strategy for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesions, several studies have demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the unprotected LMCA is feasible and appears to be an alternative strategy in selected patients.

 However, the safety and efficacy of PCI in patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis are still a matter of debate.

 Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of unprotected LMCA intervention using bare metal stents (BMS).

 There was a favorable initial outcome after LMCA intervention using BMS in low-risk patients.

 However, in-stent restenosis after BMS implantation has emerged as the interference to widely perform PCI for unprotected LMCA lesions and the most important reason for selection of bypass surgery as the first choice for treating LMCA stenosis.

 In-stent restenosis in these patients not only influences long-term survival, but also make repeat intervention more complex.

 Despite endeavors to decrease in-stent restenosis after LMCA intervention using BMS, such as aggressive debulking atherectomy, the restenosis rate still remains at 20-30%.

 The sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) (Cypher, Cordis, Johnson & Johnson Corp, Miami, Florida) markedly decreases in-stent restenosis in elective patients with relatively simple coronary lesions.

 In real-world practice using SES, patients undergoing SES implantation were treated with a less restrictive interventional approach.

 However, the results are very promising similar to the randomized controlled trials.

 These findings warrant new studies to compare the efficacy of SES for more complex lesion subsets including LMCA disease with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

 Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease@highlight

The primary objective of the PRE-COMBAT trial is: To establish the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the sirolimus-eluting balloon expandable stent (Cordis Johnson & Johnson, Warren, New Jersey) compared with bypass surgery for the treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis.

 The alternative hypothesis is that the experimental strategy (coronary stenting with the sirolimus-eluting stents) is not inferior to the standard strategy (bypass surgery).
