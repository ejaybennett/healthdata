(secondQuint)Efficacy of Anti-CFA/I and CfaE Bovine Milk Immunoglobulin Against Challenge With H10407 ETEC Expressing CFA/I.

 This is a Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving up to 33 subjects.

 Subjects will be randomized into one of the following three groups.

 Group N Product 1.

 10 BIgG anti-CFA/I 2.

 10 BIgG anti-CfaE 3.

 10 LactoFree(R) Lipil(R) Volunteers will receive the test article three times daily following meals beginning 2 days prior to oral ETEC challenge (strain H10407).

 Test article will be administered for a total of 7 days.

 Monitoring procedures will assess volunteer safety, the primary endpoint (diarrhea), stool microbiology (H10407 excretion), and ETEC-specific immunology.

 All volunteers will receive antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin) starting 5 days after ETEC challenge or sooner based on pre-defined clinical criteria.

 Follow-up visits for 2 weeks post-discharge will monitor safety and immunological parameters.

 Efficacy of Anti-CFA/I and CfaE Bovine Milk Immunoglobulin Against Challenge With H10407 ETEC Expressing CFA/I@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG safety and to determine protective efficacy of anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG against diarrhea after challenge with H10407, a CFA/I-expressing ETEC strain.
