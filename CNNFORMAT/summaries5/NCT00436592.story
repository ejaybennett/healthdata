(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo in 8-24 Hour Stroke Patients.

 The study is a prospective, single arm treatment feasibility trial to determine the baseline safety and feasibility of the NeuroFlo device in acute ischemic stroke patients whose last known time symptom-free is between 8-24 hours.

 A maximum of 25 patients at 5 US sites and 25 patients at 10 Canadian & European sites may be enrolled in this initial study phase.

 An independent data safety and monitoring board will assess the safety of the treatment on a routine basis.
