(thirdQuint)Glucose in Dialysis Water in Diabetics With Chronic Renal Failure.

 The relationship between blood pressure during dialysis treatment and vasoactive hormones are studied.

 This includes measurements of plasma concentration of glucose, plasma concentrations og insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, renin, angiotensin II, endothelin.
