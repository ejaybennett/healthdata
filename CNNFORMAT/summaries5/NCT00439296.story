(fifthQuint)ABT-751 With Chemotherapy for Relapsed Pediatric ALL.

 All patients will receive the 2 courses of chemotherapy unless medical complications prevent the administration of some of the drugs.

 Treatment for the first 2 courses of therapy will last about 2 months.

 Treatment on this study will consist of a combination of 8 anti-cancer medications.

 The 8 anticancer medicines are ABT-751, dexamethasone, PEG-asparaginase, doxorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide, and 6-thioguanine.

 All the drugs except ABT-751 are well known anti-cancer drugs and have been used extensively in the treatment of cancer.

 During the Phase I portion of this study, when you enroll, you will be given an assigned dose of ABT-751.

 The dose of ABT-751 will be based on doses given in previous studies done with adults and children.

 At each dose level of ABT-751, between 3 and 6 children will receive ABT-751 in combination with chemotherapy.

 If the side effects are not too severe, the next group of children will receive a higher dose.

 The dose will continue to be increased until we find the dose that causes serious side effects.

 Your dose of ABT-751 will not be increased.

 If you have bad side effects, your dose may be decreased.

 The dose used during the Phase 2 part of this study will be determined by the outcome of the Phase I study.

 The highest dose used in Phase I that was tolerated without serious side effects will be the one used in Phase 2.

 ABT-751 With Chemotherapy for Relapsed Pediatric ALL@highlight

This is a phase I/II study of an investigational drug called ABT-751, produced by Abbott Laboratories, given in combination with chemotherapy drugs used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has come back (recurred).

 The phase I portion of this study is being done to find the highest dose of ABT-751 that can be given safely in combination with other chemotherapy drugs.

 A safe dose is one that does not result in unacceptable side effects.

 After a safe dose for ABT-751 given with chemotherapy has been found, the study will add additional patients to find out if ABT-751 (given at the maximal safe dose) when given with additional chemotherapy is an effective therapy for the treatment of children with relapsed ALL.

 It is expected that approximately 15-35 children and young adults will take part in this study.
