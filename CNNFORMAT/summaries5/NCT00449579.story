(fifthQuint)The Diagnostic Benefits of the HyperQTM System in ECG Stress Testing.

 The study population will comprise of 1200 patients referred to stress test in three Maccabi clinics or cardiac medical centers.

 All patients will perform an ECG stress test with high-frequency ECG recording from conventional 12 leads using BSP's HyperQ cent System.

 The recording will be done without affecting or interfering with any aspect of the normal due course of the test.

 Standard Bruce protocol or modified Bruce protocol will be used, with standard test termination indications.

 Two minutes of rest ECG will be recorded prior to stating the protocol.

 Following the test, the physician will interpret the test's results in the conventional manner (e.

g.

 ST changes, chest pain, etc) and decide whether the subject should be referred to additional tests.

 HyperQ cent data will be analyzed in two phases: (i) Interpretation by the physician in a non-blinded manner one day following the stress test and (ii) after performing all the exercise tests of the study group, blindly to the conventional diagnosis and the HyperQ cent analysis done previously, as well as to other outcomes of imaging procedures.

 The first HyperQ cent reading will be used to detect the subjects who were positive according to the HyperQ cent system but negative according to the conventional stress testing.

 These subjects will be referred by the physician to further clinical investigation.

 The first reading will also be used to assess the physician's interpretation in a scenario that represents a realistic clinical setting, while the second reading will be used to examine the unbiased clinical benefit of HyperQ cent data.

 The Diagnostic Benefits of the HyperQTM System in ECG Stress Testing@highlight

The main objective of this study is to determine the usefulness of the HyperQ cent System in improving the positive predictive value of conventional ECG stress testing.

 Patients who are referred for stress test will perform an ECG stress test on a treadmill, with high-frequency ECG recording from conventional 12 leads using BSP's HyperQ cent System.

 Conventional 12 lead ECG, as well as HyperQ cent recordings will be provided by the HyperQ cent System.

 The results of the conventional test and the HyperQ cent data will be compared, using one of three cardiac tests (stress echocardiography, SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging and angiography) as gold standards.

 Statistical analysis will compare the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the conventional and HyperQ cent stress ECG in detecting myocardial ischemia.
