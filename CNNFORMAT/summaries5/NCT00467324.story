 Tongue Advancement for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: An Evaluation of the Aspire Medical Advance System.

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major health problem in the United States and can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular problems.

 The primary treatment for OSA today is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

 Many patients however are unable to tolerate sleeping with a CPAP machine.

 Surgery is one of the main treatment options available today to these CPAP-intolerant patients.

 However, current methods of sleep surgery are painful, morbid, and/or lack decent effectiveness.

 This trial will measure the effectiveness of the Advance System, an implantable medical device to treat OSA.

 In the trial, patients who meet the study entry criteria receive a baseline sleep study (PSG).

 The Advance System is then implanted and 6 months after implantation, another PSG is performed.

 The trial will compare the baseline and the 6 month apnea-hypopnea indices.

The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the Aspire Medical Advance System in obstructive sleep apnea by demonstrating a statistically significant mean reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from baseline to 6 months, measured by polysomnography (PSG).
