(fifthQuint)Memantine as a Supplement to Naltrexone in Treating Heroin Dependence.

 In the proposed trial heroin-dependent patients undergoing detoxification will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (1) Naltrexone + Placebo; (2) Naltrexone + Memantine 20 mg bid.

 Long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone (Vivitrol) will be administered once per month (the total of three injections) while memantine or placebo will be taken daily.

 In addition, patients will receive twice weekly psychosocial intervention that will include motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention.

 The goal of psychosocial intervention is to improve compliance with medication and maintain abstinence.

 A double-blind trial will last twelve weeks with assessments at baseline and at each appointment three times per week.

 After the completion of a double-blind study (experimental phase), participants will continue open label treatment with Vivitrol and therapy for additional three months (study extension phase).

 Repeated assessments will also be completed one, two, and three months following the end of double-blind treatment.

 For the experimental phase of the study, the primary aim is to test the efficacy of memantine in reducing early attrition and improving outcome in opioid-dependent individuals maintained on naltrexone and primary outcome measures will be retention in treatment by the end of the study and heroin abstinence.
