(thirdQuint)Fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET Imaging for Early Detection of Residual Disease in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the sensitivity and specificity of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging in detecting residual disease within 48 hours after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the findings on day 7 after RFA using FDG-PET imaging in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

 Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging at baseline.

 They then undergo percutaneous laparoscopic or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

 Patients then undergo further FDG-PET scans within 48 hours and 7 days after RFA.

 FDG-PET images are evaluated for residual disease, including focal FDG uptake at the site of ablation.

 Beginning 1 month after RFA, patients undergo contrast-enhanced MRI for routine post-ablation follow-up.

 MRI scans are performed at 1, 4, 7, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of RFA.

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging, may be effective in detecting residual disease after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging to see how well it works for early detection of residual disease in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
