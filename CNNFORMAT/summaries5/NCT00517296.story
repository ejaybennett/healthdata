(secondQuint)Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Guided Treatment With Humira for Crohn's Perianal Fistulas.

 Prospective randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of rectal EUS to guide perianal fistula treatment.

 Our hypothesis is that using imaging, in this case endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), to initially evaluate and then guide therapy with an anti-TNF agent (adalimumab) for fistulizing disease will lead to better short- and long-term outcomes.
