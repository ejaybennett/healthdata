(secondQuint)Suicide Prevention by Lithium - the Lithium Intervention Study.

 Several studies have shown that there is a significantly increased risk of suicide related mortality in patients with a positive history of suicide attempts.

 This study is the first prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center trial focussing on the proposed suicide preventive effects of lithium in patients with suicidal behavior but not suffering from bipolar disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder.

 Patients with a recent history of a suicide attempt are treated with lithium or placebo during a 12 month-period.

 The hypothesis is that lithium treatment will lead to a 50 % reduction of suicidal behavior.
