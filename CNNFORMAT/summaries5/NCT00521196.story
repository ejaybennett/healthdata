(fifthQuint)Migraine--Investigational Treatment of Migraine With Noninvasive Brain Stimulation.

 (tDCS- Migraine).

 We will rigorously test whether modulation of the motor cortex by tDCS is an effective treatment for patients with migraine through the following specific aims: A) The primary aim of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation applied to the motor cortex in patients with migraine induces a significant decrease in the pain associated with migraine attacks as compared with sham tDCS.

 We will also measure changes in the number of migraine attacks, abortive drug intake (e.

g.

 opioids, triptans), as well as overall improvement in the quality of life to assess the effects of this treatment.

 B) Determine whether the clinical effects of tDCS are long-lasting.

 We will therefore compare the amelioration of migraine-associated pain between active and sham tDCS after 1, 2 and 4 months of treatment.

 C) Determine whether tDCS changes the threshold for pain detection as compared with sham tDCS.

 Patients with migraine have a lower threshold for pain as compared to healthy subjects and we hypothesize that this threshold as measured by Von Frey Hair Test and Quantitative Sensory Test will increase after stimulation with tDCS.

 D) Finally, we will examine whether 1 month of tDCS treatment is safe for use in migraine patients.

 Safety will be assessed through neuropsychological tests and adverse event reporting.

 Migraine--Investigational Treatment of Migraine With Noninvasive Brain Stimulation.

 (tDCS- Migraine)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a painless and noninvasive procedure called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can be an effective therapy for the treatment of migraine and migraine-associated pain.

 Stimulation of the motor cortex with tDCS has already been shown to relieve pain in patients with other chronic pain syndromes, including traumatic spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia.

 Patients with migraine are usually extremely sensitive to pain.

 A treatment that targets the areas of the brain that are related to the experience of pain may also help decrease pain in patients with migraine.

 Pain control with this localized approach may help avoid the problems due to pain medications that affect all organs in the body.

 We hypothesize that 10 sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over the area of the brain that controls pain and motor function will decrease pain and headache frequency in patients with migraine.
