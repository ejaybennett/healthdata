(fifthQuint)Standard Antiretroviral v.

 Multi-class Therapy in Acutely HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral-Nave Subjects (ADARC 2007-01).

 - DURATION: Subjects will participate for at least 60 weeks and up to 96 weeks if in the opinion of the investigator and patient that continued therapy is in the patient's best interest.

 - SAMPLE SIZE: 36 subjects randomized 2:1 multi-class versus standard antiretroviral therapy.

 - POPULATION: Acutely HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral (ARV) drug-naive ( 7 days of ARV treatment at anytime prior to study entry*) men and women 18 years of age.

 - REGIMEN: At entry subjects will be randomized to one of the following in a 1:2 ratio: ARM A: FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD + darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg QD ARM B: FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg QD + darunavir 800mg/ritonavir 100 mg QD + Raltegravir 400 mg BID + Maraviroc 150 mg BID The three primary objectives are: 1.

 To assess whether a multi-class regimen could completely suppress virus replication in HIV infected individuals based on: - Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 48 weeks - Ultrasensitive < 50 copy assay - 5 copy assay - 1 copy assay - Cell associated HIV-1RNA levels at week 48 - Proviral DNA - Levels at week 48 - Decay rates from week 12 to week 48 2.

 To determine whether multi-class antiviral therapy results in enhanced immune reconstitution in peripheral blood and gastrointestinal mucosa based on flow and immunohistochemistry.

 3.

 To assess tolerability of multi-class compact antiviral therapy to that of standard compact antiviral therapy.

 Multi-class Therapy in Acutely HIV-1 Infected Antiretroviral-Nave Subjects (ADARC 2007-01)@highlight

The researchers are involved in a phase II, randomized, two-arm study, comparing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of open-label ritonavir (RTV)-enhanced darunavir with Truvada to a 5-drug multi-class regimen including truvada, darunavir/ritonavir/maraviroc/and raltegravir on acutely HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral (ARV) drug-naive men and women.

 Subjects will participate for at least 60 weeks and up to 96 weeks if in the opinion of the investigator and patient that continued therapy is in the patient's best interest.

 Hypotheses: - Multi-class antiretroviral therapy (ART) is superior to RTV-enhanced ATV in combination with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF (FTC/TDF) with respect to suppression of viral replication.

 - Multi-class ART is superior to RTV-enhanced ATV in combination with FTC/TDF with respect to immune reconstitution in peripheral blood and in the gastrointestinal mucosa.

 - Multi-class ART is equivalent to RTV-enhanced ATV in combination with FTC/TDF with respect to tolerability.
