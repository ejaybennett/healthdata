(secondQuint)Dose Ranging Study of Dialysate Containing Soluble Iron to Treat Subjects With End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis.

 The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of SFP-containing dialysate solution in maintaining physiological iron levels during chronic hemodialysis, as measured by the primary endpoint of the percent of patients whose Hemoglobin (Hgb) decreased by at least 1.

0 gram/ deciliter (g/dL) from baseline.

 The efficacy and safety findings are to be used to determine the optimal concentration of SFP needed to safely maintain iron levels, compensating for iron losses during chronic hemodialysis.
