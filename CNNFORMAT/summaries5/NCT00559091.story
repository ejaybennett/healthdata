(secondQuint)A Study of Ribavirin to Treat M4 and M5 Acute Myelocytic Leukemia.

 The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is dysregulated in many human malignancies, including a subset of myeloid leukemia (M4/M5 AML and blast crisis CML).

 eIF4E overexpression leads to oncogenic transformation.

 Ribavirin impedes eIF4E mediated transformation in vitro, in primary human specimens and in animal models.

 While ribavirin has been used extensively for the treatment of viral hepatitis C and its safety profile has been well defined, it has never been used in patients with AML.

 This study will establish the efficacy and safety of ribavirin in M4/M5 AML patients.

 In addition, this study will also include correlative studies to determine the effect of ribavirin on eIF4E activity and eIF4E related pathways in M4/M5 AML patients.

 A Study of Ribavirin to Treat M4 and M5 Acute Myelocytic Leukemia@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if ribavirin (a drug commonly used to treat hepatitis C) also has activity in the treatment of patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of the M4 and M5 subtype.
