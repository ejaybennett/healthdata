 The primary aims and hypotheses of this study are: 1.

 To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of 12 weeks of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline for increasing the point prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 weeks among cigarette smokers.

 Hypothesis: The combination of bupropion SR plus varenicline for 12 weeks will increase the point prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 weeks among cigarettes smokers.

 2.

 To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline for decreasing craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms among cigarette smokers trying to achieve smoking abstinence.

 Hypothesis: 12 weeks of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline will significantly decrease craving and nicotine withdrawal among cigarette smokers trying to achieve smoking abstinence.

 Chantix & Bupropion for Smoking Cessation@highlight

The overarching goal of this line of research is to increase smoking abstinence rates using a combination of existing pharmacotherapies.

 The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and compliance as well as obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy and effect on craving and nicotine withdrawal of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline.

 We will compare the efficacy estimates in this study with historical smoking abstinence rates with varenicline.

 To accomplish our aims, we will enroll 38 cigarette smokers in an open-label, phase II clinical trial.
