(firstQuint)Study Evaluating the Addition of Fulvestrant to Erlotinib in Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 Erlotinib is an oral drug which is able to block endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).

 EGFR stimulates cancer cell growth.

 Fulvestrant (faslodex) block estrogen hormone from gaining access to tumor and stimulating the tumor cells to grow.

 Both of these drugs are already approved by FDA but have not been studied in this combination.

 We will study if the combination of these drugs will delay treatment failure.

 Lung cancer tumors in both males and females can be sensitive to estrogen.

 Only patients whose tumor expresses the estrogen will be eligible for the trial.

 Estrogen sensitivity will be tested on previously removed tumor specimens.

 Study Evaluating the Addition of Fulvestrant to Erlotinib in Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

The main purpose of this research study is to see if adding fulvestrant (Faslodex) to erlotinib (Tarceva) is effective in patients with stage IIIb/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
