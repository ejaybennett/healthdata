(thirdQuint)Deferasirox in Treating Patients With Iron Overload After Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the safety of deferasirox given over 6 months in reducing liver iron concentration in patients with transfusional iron overload after undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

 Secondary - To evaluate the efficacy of deferasirox in reducing liver iron overload in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
