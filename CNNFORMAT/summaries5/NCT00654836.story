(fifthQuint)Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the progression-free survival of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and bevacizumab as first-line therapy.

 Secondary - To determine the response rate in these patients.

 - To determine the overall survival of these patients.

 - To evaluate the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and bevacizumab IV on days 1, 22 and 43.

 Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8 ,15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archived tumor tissue samples are assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for various biomarkers.

 Levels of Notch-1, Notch-4, cyclin A, cyclin B, Jagged-1, and DLL4 in tumor-associated endothelial cells are correlated with response in both estrogen- and progesterone-positive and negative tumors, and independently of p53 status.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.

 Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

 Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

 Giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
