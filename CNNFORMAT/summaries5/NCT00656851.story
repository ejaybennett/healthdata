(fifthQuint)Myocardial Function & FFA Metabolism in HIV Metabolic Syndrome.

 We hypothesize that myocardial free fatty acid and glucose utilization and oxidation rates are dysregulated in HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome in comparison to HIV+ people without The Metabolic Syndrome, and in comparison to HIV-seronegative people with and without The Metabolic Syndrome.

 We hypothesize that dysregulated myocardial fatty acid and glucose metabolism is associated with impaired heart function (diastolic dysfunction) in HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome.

 We will use myocardial positron emission tomography, radioactive isotope tracers of palmitate and glucose, and echocardiography to evaluate myocardial metabolism and function.

 HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome will receive 16wks of exercise training or pioglitazone (Actos), and we will evaluate their potential beneficial effects on myocardial metabolism and function.

 Myocardial Function & FFA Metabolism in HIV Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

We hypothesize that the hearts of HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome use and oxidize fats and sugars inappropriately, and that this may impair the heart's ability to pump blood.

 We hypothesize that exercise training or pioglitazone (Actos) will improve fat and sugar metabolism in the hearts of HIV+ people with The Metabolic Syndrome.

 This study will advance our understanding of cardiovascular disease in HIV+ people, and will test the efficacy of exercise training and pioglitazone for improving insulin resistance, heart metabolism and heart function in this at risk population.
