(secondQuint)Computer Assisted Volumetric Analysis of CT-Identified Metastatic Pulmonary Or Hepatic Lesions.

 This is a Pilot Study that will evaluate if metastatic liver and lung tumor measurements made by the MeVis cent software program can provide more accurate information about the size and changes of the tumor compared to the current evaluation method, RECIST(Response Evaluation In Solid Tumors).

 This study will also collect information about the kind of treatment each subject receives.

 Subjects will receive standard of care surveillance CT examinations(a baseline to document tumor size and interval CT exams as indicated by the Oncology Department Protocols); the tumor will be measured according to the current standard-RECIST by Radiology personnel not involved in the study.

 The CT data will then be analyzed by investigators using the MeVis cent software.

 Computer Assisted Volumetric Analysis of CT-Identified Metastatic Pulmonary Or Hepatic Lesions@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a new type of CT computer program(MeVis cent )to accurately analyze and measure the size and changes in metastatic Liver and Lung tumors.

 This study will evaluate the data from current CT evaluation methods using the MeVis cent 3-D software.
