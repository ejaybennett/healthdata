(secondQuint)Maintenance Bee-Venom Immunotherapy Administered at 6-Month Intervals Does Not Protect Against re-Stings.

 Background: The intervals at which maintenance venom immunotherapy (MVIT) is administered have been progressively extended over the years.

 Objective: To examine whether the administration of bee venom (BV) maintenance dose (MD) at 6-month interval is safe and efficacious.

 Methods: The usual 3-month interval at which venom allergic patients were receiving their MVIT was gradually extended to 6 months.

 Systemic reactions (SRs) to immunotherapy injections or to field stings were regularly recorded.

 BV allergic patients were deliberately sting-challenged after reaching the 6-month interval.

 Maintenance Bee-Venom Immunotherapy Administered at 6-Month Intervals Does Not Protect Against re-Stings@highlight

Maintenance venom immunotherapy administered at 6-month intervals to bee-venom allergic patients failed to provide protection from systemic reactions after sting challenges.

 These patients should continue their immunotherapy at 1-3 month intervals.
