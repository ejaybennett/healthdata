(secondQuint)Neoadjuvant Dasatinib and Radical Cystectomy for Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder.

 OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

 This is a pilot study designed to determine the safety and feasibility of treatment with dasatinib 100 mg administered orally once daily for 4 weeks duration prior to radical cystectomy for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder ineligible for and/or willing to forgo neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.

 If surgery delay is imperative, dasatinib therapy should continue until at least 24 hours before planned surgery.
