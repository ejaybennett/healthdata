(fifthQuint)Effect of the Number of Inseminated Spermatozoa on Subsequent Human Embryonic Development in Vitro.

 1.

 BACKGROUND In human in-vitro fertilization procedures, oocytes are usually inseminated with concentrations that vary between 50 000 and 150 000 spermatozoa per ml fertilization medium.

 It has been shown that increasing the concentration of spermatozoa to >200 000 per ml, results in decreased fertilisation rates (66,7% in the group inseminated with 200 000 spermatozoa/ml versus 79,7% in the group inseminated with 10 000-90 000/ml; p mu l fertilization medium with a maximum of 5 oocytes.

 After incubation at 37C, oocytes are inseminated by adding 30 mu l of the sperm sample with either the low or the high concentration.

 Fertilization is evaluated 18-20h after the insemination.

 Embryo quality is evaluated on day 2, 3 and 5 (cleavage stage, morphology and symmetry).

 Depending on the number of fertilized oocytes and on the number of previous cycles, embryo transfer is performed on day 2, 3 or day 5.

 According to the transfer policy of the Belgian law (Koninklijk Besluit, 1 juli 2003), the best embryo(s) (based on cleavage stage, morphology and symmetry) are transferred into the uterus.

 On the day of transfer all surplus embryos of sufficient quality are cryopreserved.

 - Outcome variables and Power calculation The primary outcome variable of this study is the embryo development evaluated by the number of good quality embryos on day 2 and day 3 (in 7 or 8 cell stage).

 To test the hypothesis that the percentage of 7 to 8 cell-embryos in the group with the low insemination concentration (150 000/ml spermatozoa) is significantly higher (40%) than the percentage of the group with the high insemination concentration (30%), power calculation revealed that 299 embryos are needed in each group on day 3 (beta= 0.

8 and alpha <0.

05).

 Other outcome variables of this study are the fertilization rate, the incidence of polyspermy, pregnancy rate and implantation rate per transferred embryo.

 Effect of the Number of Inseminated Spermatozoa on Subsequent Human Embryonic Development in Vitro@highlight

In order to reach fertilization in the context of IVF, the presence of high concentrations of spermatozoa is associated with a higher degree of sperm metabolism and a higher concentration of sperm degradation products, which may adversely affect not only sperm and oocyte viability and the fertilization rate.

 The effect of a high concentration of sperm used for oocyte insemination appears also to be negative on embryo development (Dumoulin et al 1992*).

 If that is true, lowering the sperm concentration for oocyte insemination might improve embryo quality and result in a higher implantation rate per embryo.

 Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the percentage of 8 cell-embryos on day 3 after IVF is significantly higher (40%) after insemination with a low sperm concentration (150 000/ml spermatozoa) than after insemination with a higher sperm concentration (30%; group 600 000/ml spermatozoa).
