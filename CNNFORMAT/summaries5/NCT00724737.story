(secondQuint)Presurgical Planning With Functional MRI (fMRI) Mapping of Motor Cortex in Patients With Cerebral Tumors.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if fMRI is precise enough to be used in preoperative decision making for patients who have brain tumors.

 Before a patient has brain surgery to have the tumor removed, functional mapping of the brain takes place either intra-operatively or post operatively after a subdural grid implant has been placed.

 Mapping helps the surgeon determine which areas of the brain are responsible for different important body functions.

 During this mapping procedure the surgeon determines if they can safely remove all or part of a brain tumor.

 The investigators are hoping to show that fMRI is just as accurate in mapping out different areas of the brain, without having to utilize an invasive form of brain mapping.

The purpose of this study is to determine if functional MRI is precise enough to provide information about the location of brain functions in patients who have brain tumors.

 This might allow physicians to use a non-invasive procedure to assist with brain mapping prior to surgery
