(secondQuint)Increasing Adherence to Follow-up of Breast Abnormalities in Low-Income Korean American Women.

 The purpose of this study is to design an intervention to assist Korean American women who have been identified with a potential breast abnormality through the Breast Cancer Early Detection Program and who have missed their first follow-up appointment (at risk women).

 Intervention activities will include reminder phone calls or home visits by a trained peer navigator to explain the importance of follow-up procedures, emotional support, help with transportation to follow-up appointments, translations, organizing care for children or grandchildren during medical appointments, and other assistance to overcome barriers to follow-up identified during the initial phase of the study.

 The investigators will collect extensive process measures including number and type of intervention activities requested and delivered in order to estimate the feasibility for institutionalizing intervention activities.

 The investigators will conduct chart reviews and a follow-up survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing adherence to follow-up procedures.
