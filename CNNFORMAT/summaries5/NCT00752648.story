(thirdQuint)TMC435350-TiDP16-C106: A Phase I Trial to Compare the Bioavailability and Plasma Pharmacokinetics After a Single Oral Dose of TMC435350 of 2 Different Solid Formulations Relative to a Powder Blend Capsule.

 This is a Phase I, open-label, 3-way crossover trial in 12 healthy adult volunteers to compare the oral bioavailability of a single 200 mg intake of TMC435350 salt, formulated as 2 different solid formulations (a tablet and a capsule) to that of a single 200 mg intake of TMC435350 salt, formulated as a powder blend in a capsule.

 TMC435350 is a protease inhibitor in development for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

 During 3 sessions, each volunteer will receive 3 treatments according to a classical 6-sequence, 3-period Williams design.

The treatments administered are: Treatment A: single dose of 200 mg TMC435350 salt, formulated as a powder blend filled in a capsule.

 Treatment B: single dose of 200 mg TMC435350 salt, formulated in a tablet.

 Treatment C: single dose of 200 mg.

 MC435350 salt, formulated in beads filled in a capsule.

 All medication intakes will be oral and under fed conditions.

 There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between medication intakes in subsequent treatment sessions.

 Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC435350 will be determined up to 72 hours after administration in each session.

 Safety and tolerability will be monitored continuously throughout the trial.

 Treatments A, B and C: TMC435350 200mg on Day 1 of each session.

Intakes will be oral and in fed conditions.
