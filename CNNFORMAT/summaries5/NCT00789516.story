(fifthQuint)The Change of Coagulation Markers in Children With -thalassemia Disease After Stem Cell Transplantation.

 Hypercoagulable state is well recognized in patients with -thalassemia.

 Evidences of hypercoagulability include abnormal expression of phosphatidylserine on red blood cell (rbc) surface and consequent increased platelet activation and thrombin generation.

 In addition, a reduction of anticoagulants i.

e.

 proteins C and S and antithrombin (AT) was demonstrated.

 However, coagulable state in patients with -thalassemia following stem cell transplantation (SCT) has not been characterized.

Therefore, the objective is to compare coagulation markers and anticoagulants among -thalassemics with and without SCT and normal control (NC).

The subjects will be classified into 3 groups; -thalassemia post SCT (Thal-SCT), -thalassemia treated with regular transfusion (Thal-RT) and NC.

 Blood samples will be tested for annexin V (an index of abnormal expression of phosphatidylserine on rbc surface), markers of activation of coagulation system (thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment (F1+2), and D-dimer) and anticoagulants (proteins C and S and AT).
