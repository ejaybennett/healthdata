(thirdQuint)A Scandinavian Sarcoma Group Protocol for Patients With High-risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities and Trunk Wall.

 SSG XX, the third adjuvant STS protocol by SSG, is a phase II non-randomized trial in patients with high risk to develop metastases.

 SSG XX is based on a previous SSG trial (SSG XIII) regarding use of prognostic markers to identify high-risk tumors and include very similar chemo- and radiotherapy treatment schedules compared to SSG XIII, but the new protocol also includes a treatment arm with preoperative chemo- and radiotherapy for patients with an obvious risk for intralesional surgery initially.

 Patients: In this new adjuvant protocol SSG adopts an inclusion decision algorithm based on the following criteria: 1.

vascular invasion or 2.

 presence of at least two of the risk factors: tumor size =>8 cm, necrosis or infiltrative growth(all defined microscopically by the pathologist.

 The system was developed retrospectively by evaluation of 434 primary histologically high grade (III-IV) STS from the SSG registry, and was later validated in a series of 175 patients in which patients with a high risk for metastases (>40 %) and low risk ( 18 y and 70y: 50mg/m2 and 5g/m2 ).

 Dependent on surgical resection margins, 36Gy or 45Gy (1,8Gy per fraction, two fractions daily) will be given interpolated with chemotherapy.

 Conclusion: SSG XX will evaluate chemo-and radiotherapy given adjuvantly to patients with STS and high risk for metastases (arm A).

 In a specified group of patients also preoperatively given therapy will be studied(arm B).

 Other sarcoma centers are invited to participate in the study.

 A Scandinavian Sarcoma Group Protocol for Patients With High-risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities and Trunk Wall@highlight

SSG XX is a phase II trial for high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities and trunk wall.

 Prognostic factors (histopathological markers) are used to identify high-risk tumors.

 SSG XX will evaluate chemo- and radiotherapy given adjuvantly to these patients.

 In a specified group of patients also preoperatively given therapy will be studied.
