(thirdQuint)A Study of the NeoVista Ophthalmic System for the Treatment of Subfoveal CNV Associated With Wet AMD in Patients That Require Persistent Anti-VEGF Therapy.

 Therapeutic advances in the arena of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have provided multiple treatment options for the disease.

 Brachytherapy has been studied in multiple clinical trials in the past with many studies showing a therapeutic benefit.

 Treatment with radiotherapy and anti-VEGF compounds is a promising approach to treating AMD.

 The current treatment for neovascualar AMD involves multiple injections over an indefinite period of time.

 This trial will evaluate whether treatment with brachytherapy can reduce or eliminate the need for continued injections.

The objective of the MERITAGE Trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of focal delivery of radiation for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in patients that require persistent injections of Anti-VEGF therapy to maintain an adequate response to treatment.
