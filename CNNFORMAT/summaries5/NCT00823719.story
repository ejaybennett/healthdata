(thirdQuint)Phase II Study of Ofatumumab Plus Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, Etoposide (ICE) or Dexamethasone, Cytarabine, Cisplatin (DHAP) Chemotherapy Regimen in Relapsed/ Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

 Rituximab combined with anthracycline based chemotherapy is the most common first-line treatment for subjects with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

 Subjects requiring second-line therapy will most often receive rituximab in combination with salvage chemotherapy as an induction therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant.

 With rituximab being in first-line therapy, the response rates for subjects receiving rituximab plus salvage chemotherapy has significantly decreased.

 Treatment with ofatumumab may be able to overcome the resistance to rituximab in the second-line setting and offer improved response rates.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate of ofatumumab in combination with ICE or DHAP chemotherapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant.

 Additional objectives are to evaluate the complete response rate, ability to mobilize cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab used in combination with ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE) or dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin (DHAP) salvage chemotherapy regimens in subjects with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant.
