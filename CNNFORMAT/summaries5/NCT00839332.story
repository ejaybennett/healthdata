(thirdQuint)A Study for Participants With Pancreatic Cancer.

 Phase 1 included a dose escalation of LY2603618 doses from 70 milligrams/meter squared (mg/m^2) to 250 mg/m^2 divided into 5 cohorts.

 Each participant was assigned to a single cohort with no intra-participant dose escalation.

 Phase 1 also included an expansion cohort where participants received a flat dose of 200 or 230 mg LY2603618.

 Participants received gemcitabine on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by LY2603618 on Days 2, 9, and 16 of each 28-day cycle.

 The purpose of the Phase 1 portion was to determine the maximum tolerated LY2603618 dose to be carried into the Phase 2 portion of the study.

The purpose of the Phase 1 portion of this study was to determine the dose of LY2603618 that can be safely administered 24 hours after gemcitabine treatment.

 This dose was then used for the Phase 2 portion of the study.

 The Phase 2 portion of the study evaluated whether LY2603618, when administered 24 hours after gemcitabine therapy, was an effective treatment for participants with pancreatic cancer.
