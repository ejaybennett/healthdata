(firstQuint)Assessment of Arformoterol for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Using Hyperpolarized 3He MRI.

 Hyperpolarized Helium Lung imaging has already been tested and proven to be scientifically possible in patients with a number of pulmonary disorders.

 However there is limited data on the sensitivity of this imaging technique, which would be essential for clinical use.

 This study is a double blinded study with two cohorts, each cohort being made up of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COPD.

 One group will receive a placebo while the other will receive treatment.

 A comparison of the data will resume once twenty patients have been consented and completed the study procedures.
