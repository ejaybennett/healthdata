(secondQuint)Gene Therapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral injection of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 gene in women with metastatic breast cancer.

 - Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive a single dose of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 intratumorally via percutaneous needle placement under ultrasound guidance.

 Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically for immunological laboratory studies.

 Samples are analyzed for serum cytokine levels by ELISA; qualitative analysis of immune biomarkers by IHC staining; and immune cell biomarker analysis by FACS.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Gene Therapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into breast cancer cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.
