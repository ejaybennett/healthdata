(fifthQuint)Behavioral Intervention Study for Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women.

 Despite considerable progress in U.

S.

 cancer control over the past 20 years, certain ethnic minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities.

 Recent immigrants including Korean Americans (KA), face an unequal cancer burden related to the significant language and cultural barriers they face in attempting to navigate the U.

S.

 healthcare system.

 KA women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence.

 Not only are their breast and cervical cancers diagnosed at significantly later stages than those of whites, but they are also the least likely racial/ethnic group to receive early breast and cervical cancer screening.

 This community-based behavioral intervention is designed 1) to evaluate, in a randomized controlled trial, the effects of our health literacy-focused cancer control intervention, delivered by trained CHWs, on the primary outcomes: mammography and Papanicolaou(Pap)test screening adherence, in a sample of 360 KA women, 2)to test the effects of the proposed intervention on the secondary outcomes: level of health literacy, breast and cervical knowledge, and decisional balance, in the KA sample.

 Behavioral Intervention Study for Better Breast and Cervical Cancer Control for Korean American Women@highlight

The long-term goal of this study is to build a sustainable,community-based outreach program using Korean American community health workers (CHWs) to promote breast and cervical screening among Korean American women, thereby reducing related morbidity and mortality.

 The study is designed to determine the effectiveness of a health literacy-focused tailored breast and cervical cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs.

 The investigators hypothesized that, compared to KA women in the delayed intervention group, KA women who receive a health literacy-focused CHW intervention will demonstrate: (1) higher levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer, (2) greater levels of health literacy, (3) higher levels of breast and cervical cancer knowledge, and (4) improve decisional balance.
