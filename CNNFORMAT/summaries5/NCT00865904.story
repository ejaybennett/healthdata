(secondQuint)Study of VX-809 in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects With the F508-CFTR Gene Mutation.

 This was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study of orally-administered VX-809 in participants with CF who are homozygous for the specific CFTR mutation known as F508 or F508del.

 Enrollment was planned for 90 participants at approximately 20 centers.

 Participants were planned to be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 1 of 4 doses of VX-809 or placebo once a day for 28 days in a parallel design.

 Participants were outpatients during the study, except for overnight stays on Day 1 and 28.
