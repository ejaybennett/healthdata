(firstQuint)The Influence of Dimensional Anatomic Variables on the Outcomes of Maxillary Sinus Grafting Procedures.

 Inadequate alveolar bone height as a consequence of tooth loss is a common limitation for properly placing endosseous dental implants in the posterior maxilla.

 Grafting of the maxillary sinus has been regarded as one of the most reliable surgical alternatives to correct this problem.

 Several sinus grafting techniques, using different materials, have been reported showing high survival rates.

 However, there are many factors that may alter the outcomes of this procedure.

 The maturation and consolidation of the grafted area relies on the proper formation of a functional graft-vital bone complex.

 This maturation process requires an adequate migration of osteogenic cells from native bone, that could be limited in situations where the dimensions of the maxillary sinus are excessive.

 Hence, the purpose of this research project is to determine the influence of the distance from the lateral to the medial wall of the maxillary sinus on the outcomes of a sinus augmentation procedures performed using the lateral approach using clinical, radiographic and histomorphometric analysis.

The hypothesis of this study is that there is a significant difference in bone maturation after sinus grafting determined by the distance from the buccal to the palatal wall of this cavity.
