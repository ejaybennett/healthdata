(secondQuint)A Study of Neutropenia and Anemia Management in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy.

 This is a multi-center international observational study of patients receiving myelotoxic regimens, with an investigator assessed risk of febrile neutropenia 20%, for the treatment of solid tumors (breast, ovarian and lung).

 This is an observational study in which patient risk factors were qualitatively (but not quantitatively) assessed, and adherence to G-CSF primary prophylaxis was at the discretion of physicians and not mandated by the protocol.
