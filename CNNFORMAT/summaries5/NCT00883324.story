(fifthQuint)Comparison of Fetal Fibronectin (fFN) Specimen Collection Methodologies: With Speculum Versus Without Speculum.

 The study population will include pregnant women who may be at risk for preterm delivery and require the fFN test, as determined by their doctor to aid in patient management.

 The subjects may or may not present with symptoms related to preterm labor and must satisfy the device's approved labeling and the eligibility criteria.

 For pregnant women with signs of labor, the Fetal Fibronectin (fFN) test is approved for use as an aid to assess the risk of preterm delivery in 7 or 14 days from cervicovaginal sample collection that have intact amniotic membranes and minimal cervical dilation (50ng/mL and a negative fFN test with concentrations 24 weeks and 34, 6 days in symptomatic women and at the gestational age of 22 weeks, 0 days and 30, 6 days in asymptomatic women.

 A finding of substantial equivalency would support a modification to the labeling to allow the collection of specimens for fFN determination with or without a speculum examination.

 Hypothesis: The method of fFN specimen collection without a speculum is not inferior to collection with a speculum within a 5% margin of non-inferiority.

 Comparison of Fetal Fibronectin (fFN) Specimen Collection Methodologies: With Speculum Versus Without Speculum@highlight

Observational study to determine whether the proposed method of fFN specimen collection without a speculum is substantially equivalent to the approved method with a speculum examination when obtained at the gestational age of 24 weeks and 34, 6 days in symptomatic women and at the gestational age of 22 weeks, 0 days and 30, 6 days in asymptomatic women.

 A finding of substantial equivalency would support a modification to the labeling to allow the collection of specimens for fFN determination with or without a speculum examination.
