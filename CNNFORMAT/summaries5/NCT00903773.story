(fifthQuint)VX-950-TiDP24-C132: A Study to Investigate the Effect of Renal Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Telaprevir.

.

 This is a Phase I, open-label trial to investigate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (TVR) in 12 participants with severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) 10 years) and BMI ( 20%).

 Open-label means that the study doctor and the participants know what treatment will be assigned to them.

 All participants will receive a single 750-mg dose of TVR.

 Pharmacokinetic profiles of total TVR up to 24 hours postdose will be determined.

 A 24 hour urine collection test will be performed to estimate the CrCl.

 In addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and unbound plasma concentrations of the sum of TVR and VRT-127394 will be assessed.

 Tolerability and safety of TVR will be assessed throughout the trial period.

 Illnesses and side effects will be checked at every visit.

 Blood and urine samples will be taken at screening, on Day 1, 2 and at the 2 follow-up visits.

 ECG and vital signs will be taken at screening, twice on day 1, on day 2 and at the first follow-up visit.

 At the second follow-up visit vital signs alone will be determined.

 A physical examination will be done at screening, on the day before TVR intake, on day 2 and at both follow-up visits.

 All participants will receive a single 750-mg dose of telaprevir (TVR) given by mouth as 2 tablets of 375 mg.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of severe renal impairment or failure on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (TVR).

 Pharmacokinetics means how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body.

 In addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and unbound plasma concentrations of the sum of TVR and its R-diastereomer VRT-127394 will be assessed.

 (Diastereomers are substances whose chemical structures are mirror images of each other).

 Finally, the short-term safety and tolerability of TVR in participants with severe kidney disease will be determined.

 The results of this study will guide dose recommendations for TVR in subjects with kidney disease.
