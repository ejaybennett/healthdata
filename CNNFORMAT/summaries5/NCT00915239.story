(firstQuint)Symptom Evaluation After Cessation of a Proton Pump Inhibitor in Healthy Volunteers.

 Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) has been shown to cause rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid.

 The clinical significance of this phenomenon is however unclear.

 This study aims to examine whether or not healthy volunteers, who over a relatively short period of time treated with a PPI, develop dyspeptic symptoms after cessation of therapy.

 Dyspeptic symptoms will be measured subjectively using a validated questionnaire, which is filled out each day.

 Gastric acid will be measured indirectly with measurement of acid secretion markers (Gastrin and chromogranin-A).

The purpose of this study is to determine whether proton pump inhibitor (PPI) induced hypersecretion leads to acid related symptoms after treatment in healthy volunteers.
