(secondQuint)Chest Wall Repair of Rib Fractures After Trauma.

 Hypothesis: Rib fracture repair utilizing open reduction and internal fixation with commercially available rib plating systems improves outcomes (i.

e.

, infectious complications), decreases hospital stay and mortality.

 Study Design: This is a prospective, observational study of 50 patients who, due to their injury pattern, are operative candidates for open reduction and internal fixation with commercial available rib plating systems for one of the following indications: 1.

 Flail chest with/without failure to wean from the ventilator 2.

 Significantly displaced rib fractures with/without lung impalement 3.

 Symptomatic multiple rib fractures - Failure of pain control Outcome measures to be evaluated include: 1.

 Hospital Mortality 2.

 Ventilator free days 3.

 Need for tracheotomy 4.

 Infectious Complications (pneumonia, bacteremia, UTI, empyema) 5.

 Hospital & ICU Days 6.

 Disposition following discharge.

 Chest Wall Repair of Rib Fractures After Trauma@highlight

This is a prospective, observational trial of 50 patients who have multiple, severe rib fractures following trauma.

 The investigators will follow their hospital stay for outcomes (infections, length of stay and medical care) as well as their early post-hospital course.
