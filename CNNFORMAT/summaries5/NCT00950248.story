(fifthQuint)Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS).

 Objective: The goal of this study is to assess the safety, therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action of idebenone in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) patients.

 Study Population: Adult, untreated patients with PP-MS with disability ranging from none to moderately severe will be included in the trial.

 The upper age limit in this study has been set at 65; setting an age limit should permit us to focus on the potential neuroprotective effect of idebenone in PP-MS and limit the confounding factor of the natural aging process and its known negative influence on neuro-regeneration.

 Published data indicate that higher doses (10-50 mg/kg) of idebenone per day are required for beneficial effects on neurological disability in comparison to the lower doses (5-10mg/kg) that are sufficient for beneficial effects on cardiac/systemic functions in Friedreich s ataxia (FRDA) patients.

 Therefore, in order to target the CNS compartment, we will use a daily dose of 2250mg (750mg 3 times per day), which will provide target values of 10-50mg/kg for virtually all adult patients.

 Design: This is a Phase I/II safety/efficacy trial with an adaptive trial design: one year of pretreatment baseline period serves the dual purpose of collecting patient-specific biomarkers of disease progression and collecting longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data for selection of primary outcome measures.

 This baseline period is then followed by a double-blind, idebenone versus placebo treatment phase for a total of 2 years.

 Based on preliminary sample size estimates, current enrollment calls for a total of 66 patients (33 per arm).

 Outcome Measures: Quantitative neuroimaging measures of central nervous system (CNS: i.

e.

 brain and spinal cord) tissue destruction and clinical and functional (i.

e.

 electrophysiological) measures of neurological disability will be collected every 6-12 months.

 Additionally, biomarkers focusing on analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress will be collected every 12 months.

 The trial is currently powered using progression of brain atrophy as detected by SIENA methodology as the primary outcome measure.

 However, this may not be the most sensitive outcome available.

 In recognition of this, the trial has an adaptive design: i.

e.

 it incorporates analysis of progression of CNS tissue destruction as measured by quantitative MRI markers and clinical/paraclinical markers defined as secondary outcome measures in the first 30 enrolled patients during the one year pre-treatment baseline, before randomization.

 All defined outcome measures collected in the first 30 enrolled patients will be transformed into z-scores and compared for the robustness of longitudinal change over the coefficient of variation.

 This will permit to select the most sensitive and most accurate outcome measure for detecting progression of CNS tissue damage.

 As a result, the primary outcome measure of this trial will be the comparison of individualized rates of brain atrophy progression between the idebenone and placebo groups after 2 years of treatment, unless the predetermined analysis of the pre-treatment baseline period in the first 30 enrolled subjects determines that one of the predefined secondary outcome measures has a higher z-score than brain atrophy measurement.

 In this case, the primary outcome would be the efficacy of idebenone versus placebo in inhibiting patient-specific slopes of functional or structural deterioration as measured by this more sensitive biomarker of CNS tissue destruction, yet to be defined by the analysis of the 1-year longitudinal data from pre-treatment baseline.

 Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS)@highlight

Background: - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that progressively weakens and destroys the pathways of the nervous system.

 About 10 percent to 15 percent of patients develop primary-progressive MS (PP-MS), characterized by progressive accumulation of disability from the disease onset, without any marked improvements or relapses.

 There are currently no effective treatments for PP-MS.

 - Idebenone is a manmade drug that is similar to a naturally occurring compound known as coenzyme Q10, a common dietary supplement.

 Research data suggest that idebenone may be able to limit demyelination and death of brain cells and thereby slow or halt the progression of neurological dysfunction such as that occurring in MS.

 Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using idebenone to treat primary progressive MS.

 Eligibility: - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

 Design: - The study will last 3 years and will be divided into two parts: a 1-year pretreatment baseline and 2 years of treatment with either idebenone or a placebo.

 - Pre-treatment study: approximately 5 clinic visits over 1 year.

 - Visit 1: Comprehensive medical history and neurological examination, with brain scans and neurological tests.

 - Visit 2: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine and lymphocytapheresis (withdrawal of white blood cells for testing).

 - Visit 3: Lumbar puncture.

 - Visit 4: Skin biopsy.

 - Visit 5: Repeat MRI of the brain and spinal cord, as well as neurological tests; these tests will be scheduled over 2 days.

 - After the five pretreatment visits, patients will receive a 6-month supply of study medication (either idebenone or a placebo) to take three times a day with food - Patients will continue to have regular followup clinic visits with brain MRI scans, blood tests, and other evaluations of brain and nervous system function.

 Randomly selected participants will have additional MRI scans for further safety precautions.
