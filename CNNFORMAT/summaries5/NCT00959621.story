(fifthQuint)Low Molecular Weight Heparin and/or Aspirin in Prevention of Habitual Abortion.

 Background: The prevalence of spontaneous abortions is 1000-1500/10000 pregnancies per year meaning that 10-15% of all pregnancies will end in an abortion; 1/10 of these abortions are recurrent (1 % of all pregnancies).

 In about half of women with habitual abortions (HAB) hereditary (F V Leiden, F II (prothrombin) mutation, Protein C, S deficiency and anti-thrombin) or acquired (antiphospholipid antibodies) thrombophilia are observed.

 Efficacy of the medical treatment of patients with a history of HAB has yet to be completely demonstrated.

 We have recently shown that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as effective as unfractionated heparin in prevention of thromboembolic complications in pregnant women and causes less bleeding complications (UFH) and has no osteoporotic effect.

 LMWH could be safer than UF-heparin during long treatment periods (7-8 months).

 Study design: Randomised placebo controlled multicenter study.

 Centers: Helsinki (2), Oulu (1), Stockholm (1), Leiden (1) Number of patients per study: 90 patients per group, 270 altogether Timetable: Starting 2/2002, finishing 31.

 Time frame: one year since entering the study with primary end-points:livebirths (> 37 weeks of gestation) and premature livebirths (> 24, but 37 weeks of gestation), premature livebirths (> 24, but 40) , lupusanticoagulant, or AT III deficiency.

 During next pregnancy the patient, with inclusion criteria fulfilled, will be asked to sign informed consent and she will be allocated into one of the three treatment groups.

 The treatment will be started before 7 weeks of gestation.

 At baseline and follow-up visits plasma, serum and 20 ml morning urine will be frozen (analysed later for antithrombin, protein S, C, APC ratio, PAI1, PAI2, U-PAR, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, CRP, TNFalpha(+ receptor), ICAM, VEGF(+receptor), urinary stabile metabolites of thromboxane and prostacyclin.

 Follow-up: US/Doppler + obstetric check-up at 8, 10, 14, 18, 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks of gestation Ending: In the group of combined medication, tablets will be stopped at 36 weeks of gesta-tion.

 LMWH will be started in all patients after delivery and continued 6 weeks postpartum.

 Low Molecular Weight Heparin and/or Aspirin in Prevention of Habitual Abortion@highlight

1 % of all pregnancies end in habitual/recurrent abortion.

 In about half of women with habitual abortions (HAB) hereditary or acquired (antiphospholipid antibodies) thrombophilia are observed.

 The investigators wanted to test whether antithrombotic treatment (Low-Molecular Weight Heparin, LMWH, ASA or both combined)would prevent these women from a subsequent abortion.

 Depending on thrombophilic status the women included in one of the three sub-studies: HABENOX 1 (mild, single thrombophilia), HABENOX 2 (no known thrombophilia), HABENOX 3 (moderate to severe thrombophilia, with combined thrombophilia or moderate to high titer antiphospholipid antibodies).

 Study design: Randomised placebo controlled multicenter study.

 Number of patients per study: 90 patients per group, 270 altogether.

 Timetable: Starting 2/2002, finishing 31.

 Time frame: >37 weeks of gestation and >24, but 37 weeks of gestation), premature livebirths (24, but <37 weeks of gestation) Secondary end-points: Bleeding complications, intrauterine growth retardation (<-2SD), pre-eclampsia, abruptio placentae, Ending: In the group of combined medication, tablets will be stopped at 36 weeks of gesta-tion.

 LMWH will be started in all patients after delivery and continued 6 weeks postpartum.
