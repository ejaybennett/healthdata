(firstQuint)Intravitreal Ranibizumab in Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachments.

 Pigment epithelial detachments (PED) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been excluded from practically all study populations of ranibizumab studies so far.

 PED represents a special entity in AMD.

 As yet, no standard treatment has been established for this disease.

The stimuli that induce PED are not very well known, but there is evidence suggesting that angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also play a role in the pathogenesis.

 Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF antibody fragment that blocks VEGF activity in patients with neovascular AMD.
