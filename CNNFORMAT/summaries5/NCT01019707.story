(fifthQuint)Safety Assessment of Atomoxetine With MA IV Administration.

 The safety of using atomoxetine in MA users will be characterized by measuring the cardiovascular effects of MA and by determining the occurrence of adverse reactions during treatment with atomoxetine and placebo.

 We will evaluate atomoxetine (0 and 40 mg, BID) and MA doses (0 and 30 mg, IV).

 Participants will be randomized to atomoxetine or matched placebo for 6 days.

 Study drug will be administered once daily at 40 mg/day on the first two study days, twice daily for days 3-5, & once on day 6.

 After discharge from the first component, and at least a 2-week washout period, participants will be re-admitted to the UCLA GCRC and switched to the opposite study medication for an additional 6 days.

 Methamphetamine/saline will be administered non-contingently on component I day 13, and component II day 7, over 1 min using a syringe pump activated by the study physician or nurse practitioner in order to assess safety and tolerability of atomoxetine.

 During drug administration sessions, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored frequently.

 A code team will respond if required.

 Vital signs must remain within values specified under Stopping Criteria for initiation of MA administration.

 The physician or nurse practitioner will administer the MA/placebo and will be available in-house on pager for at least 4 h after each infusion.

 In addition, heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed three times daily throughout the inpatient portion of the protocol.

 Safety Assessment of Atomoxetine With MA IV Administration@highlight

This is a study of 4 nontreatment seeking individuals who were MA-dependent and the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine.

 This double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study is to determine the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine.

 MA abusing participants will undergo a 1-day outpatient screening and if it is safe for the participants to proceed with the study they will participate in two inpatient components of the study that will occur in the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) General Clinical Research Center (GCRC).

 The first inpatient stay will be 15 days, and the second will be a 9 days stay that includes drug administration and assessments.

 There will be at least a two week interval between inpatient components.

 During the inpatient components participants will receive alternating study drugs; atomoxetine or placebo and four sessions of IV MA administration or saline.
