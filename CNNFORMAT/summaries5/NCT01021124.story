(thirdQuint)Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients.

 All adult bone marrow transplant recipients admitted to Asan Medical Center will be enrolled.

 Quantiferon-Gold In-Tube assay will be performed.

 Isoniazid prophylaxis will be given only to patients with clinical risk factors (i.

e.

 recent contact with active pulmonary TB patient or inadequate treatment history with abnormal CXR).

 However, isoniazid prophylaxis will be not given based on positive TST or positive Quantiferon-Gold In-Tube assay.

 Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients@highlight

The aim of this study is to estimate the usefulness of a T cell-based assay (i.

e.

 Quantiferon-Gold In-Tube assay) for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in bone marrow transplant recipients.

 For this purpose, the investigators enrolled bone marrow transplant recipients and observed the developement of tuberculosis after the transplantation.
