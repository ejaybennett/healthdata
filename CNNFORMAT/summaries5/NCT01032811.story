(fifthQuint)Pilot Study Of Primary And Secondary Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Among Survivors Of Childhood Cancer.

 1.

 This study will investigate the feasibility of assessing symptoms of developmental ADHD and "secondary ADHD" (S-ADHD) among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer using a structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure.

 (S-ADHD describes an acquired clinical presentation that is consistent with the diagnostic criteria of ADHD).

 2.

 This study will provide preliminary estimates of the rate of occurrence of ADHD/S-ADHD among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer as compared to the prevalence of developmental ADHD in the general population.

 3.

 The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and laboratory measures traditionally used to assess specific components of attention (e.

g.

, CPT) in survivors of childhood cancer.

 4.

 The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and smoking (including intentions, behaviors, and motivators) among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer.

 Pilot Study Of Primary And Secondary Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Among Survivors Of Childhood Cancer@highlight

This is a pilot study that will be an exploratory investigation of the rate of occurrence of ADHD/S-ADHD in adolescent cancer survivors.

 The procedures that will be used for identifying attention problem symptoms, determining the frequency and severity of such symptoms, and characterizing the level of impairment resulting from the symptoms are novel to pediatric oncology research.

This pilot study will draw from the approach used in traumatic brain injury research of post-injury effects to illuminate more clearly the nature of attentional late effects experienced by survivors of childhood cancer.
