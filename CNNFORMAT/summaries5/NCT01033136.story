(thirdQuint)Exposure Therapy For Veterans With PTSD And Panic Attacks.

 With the increasing number of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) Veterans returning from war-zone areas, many will experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD and comorbid problems.

 Currently, about one in every six OIF/OEF Veterans experiences PTSD and co-occurring PD.

 Although effective treatments exist for treating one or the other, we do not yet have treatments that can simultaneously target PTSD and PD.

 Thus, recent attention has focused on the development of multi-component treatments that simultaneously address PTSD and PD.

 This study is the first systematic investigation of a time-limited, multi-component cognitive-behavioral treatment for Veterans with specific comorbid anxiety problems.

 The purpose of the second phase of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component cognitive-behavioral treatment in comparison to standard PTSD treatment in military personnel returning from active duty.
