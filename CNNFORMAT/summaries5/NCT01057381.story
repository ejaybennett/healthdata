(secondQuint)Dexmedetomidine in Pediatric Tonsillectomy.

 Dexmedetomidine, an alpha 2 agonist provides some analgesia without respiratory depression.

 Children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy occasionally have episodes of respiratory obstruction in the recovery room following administration of opioids.

 As dexmedetomidine provides some analgesia without respiratory depression,an intra-operative dose of dexmedetomidine may provide adequate analgesia without significant side effects thereby allowing for quick post operative recovery.

 Dexmedetomidine in Pediatric Tonsillectomy@highlight

The hypothesis of this study is that the administration of an intra-operative dose of dexmedetomidine will result in adequate analgesia without respiratory depression thereby resulting in an early discharge from the post anesthetic care unit following adenotonsillectomy.
