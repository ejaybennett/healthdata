(thirdQuint)A Feasibility Study to Assess Critical Aspects of Fluorescence Affinity Sensor (FAS) Performance and Safety Over Several Hours.

 The FAS glucose monitoring system is a minimally invasive glucose monitoring device which is not yet approved by the FDA.

 The FAS system will be used in this study to monitor glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) performed in Dr.

Orzeck practice.

 The FAS measures glucose levels in skin tissue of the forearm or the abdomen at a depth of less than 1 mm by inserting a small needle-like device.

 During the 4-hour GTT, the needle-like FAS is left in the skin tissue.

 The FAS performance has indicated in prior experiments that it is more stable than competitive commercial glucose-sensing devices.

 Due to its unique design, its glucose response is more accurate, and less affected by certain drugs (such as pain medicine).

 A Feasibility Study to Assess Critical Aspects of Fluorescence Affinity Sensor (FAS) Performance and Safety Over Several Hours@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about a new minimally invasive glucose monitoring device called Fluorescence Affinity Sensor (FAS).

 In this study, the FAS will be used to determine its effectiveness for glucose monitoring.

 Researchers want to find out how the device performs at two different body sites (forearm and abdomen) over 4 hours.

 The safety and comfort level of the device will also be studied.
