(fifthQuint)Induction Docetaxel/Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (TPF) as Selector for Chemo Radiation Therapy (RT) Versus Partial Laryngectomy in Advanced Laryngeal Cancer.

 The optimal treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer remains controversial.

 Standard treatment options have included laryngectomy with or without radiation (RT) and radiation alone with surgical salvage (RTSS).

 Because of the significant functional morbidity associated with laryngectomy, the Department of Veterans Affair Cooperative Studies Program completed a randomized, prospective study of 332 patients that compared a new organ preservation treatment strategy to conventional laryngectomy and radiation.

 The experimental treatment arm involved three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive radiation among patients who had a partial (>50%) clinical tumor response.

 Final results of this study demonstrated comparable 2, 3, 4, and 10 year survival rates between treatment groups, with successful laryngeal preservation in 66% of the surviving patients randomized to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 This study led to a dramatic re-assessment of the treatment approach for advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer patients, who face total laryngectomy.

 Based on these results, Second approach was designed and tested in a Phase II study at the University of Michigan .

In this study, 97 patients were treated with one cycle of induction chemotherapy.

 Seventy-five percent had a >50% reduction of tumor and were treated with chemo-RT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 x 3 cycles), and 25% were non-responders who underwent total laryngectomy followed by RT.

 The overall 3-year survival rate was 85%,and the larynx preservation rate was 70%.

 This study included over 30 percentage of patients with advanced stage 4 disease, however did not specifically evaluate there outcome and therefore did not directly address the role of organ preservation in advanced disease which is considered a controversial issue in head and neck literature.

 In this study all patients (25 %) who did not respond to the initial chemotherapy were referred to total laryngectomy and therefore there were 30 %of patients who eventually underwent total laryngectomy.

Lately several series suggest the option of partial laryngectomy as an alternative to total laryngectomy as initial treatment for advanced larynx cancer ,in cases in which the cricoids cartilage and arytenoids are not involved.

Supracricoid subtotal laryngectomy spares at least one arytenoid and offers organ preservation and can also be performed according to many articles as salvage surgery in cases of radiation failure,and therefore if performed in the right indications can improve the percentage of total laryngectomy free patients without compromising survival.

 This will reflect of course on quality of life It has been suggested lately that the use of aggressive induction chemotherapy may improve outcome.

 The combination of Taxotere with Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil has been shown to be more effective than the standard cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil without an elevation in side effects .

It has been suggested that the three cycles of induction chemotherapy may lower the rate of distant metastases which is high in advanced disease Objectives Primary To determine the laryngeal preservation rate in a treatment paradigm that uses clinical response to a single cycle of induction chemotherapy to select patients for either concurrent cisplatin-radiation or surgery(if possible organ preserving partial laryngectomy) as compared to historical controls To determine the survival rate among T4 laryngeal patients in a treatment paradigm that uses clinical response to a single cycle of induction chemotherapy to select patients to either ,two more cycles of induction followed by concurrent cisplatin-radiation or surgery .

 Secondary To determine the survival rate in a treatment paradigm that uses clinical response to a single cycle of induction chemotherapy to select patients for either concurrent cisplatin-radiation or surgery including organ preserving partial laryngectomy (if possible) as compared to historical controls.

 To determine if the use of three cycles of induction chemotherapy lowers the rate of distant metastases in advanced cases; namely: positive nodal disease and T4.

 To evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of this treatment paradigm.

 To evaluate partial supracricoid laryngectomy as salvage to chemoradiation failure.

 compare PET scan results with the pathological specimen of the larynx.

 To determine correlation between changes in biological markers such as EGFR degradation EGFR mutation, p53 overexpression, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 expression, and HPV observed in tumor biopsies taken shortly after the administration of TPF, compared with pre-treatment biopsies.

 And compared to those found in the completion of treatment in cases of failures.

 Study Design Chemotherapy/Radiation/Surgery schedule Days #1-4: Patients will undergo induction chemotherapy with (TPF) docetaxel (Taxotere) 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-FU CI 750mg /m2 /24 hours days 1-4.

 See section 7.

 Day #22: Patients will undergo a direct laryngoscopy with biopsy the biopsy will be done with in 3 days.

 Patients will also undergo a repeat CT scan of the neck within a week (+/-) of their perspective biopsies.

 Patient with a 2 positive lymph nodes, perineural invasion, or positive margins).

 Cisplatin will be dosed 35 mg/m2 weekly at the discretion of the prescribing physician.

 See section 7.

2 for prescribing details for cisplatin.

 Responding patients with > 50% response will be divided to two groups those with N2 disease or stage T4 will undergo two more cycles with induction TPF others will directly undergo treatment with RT (Total dose 70 Gy) in combination with cisplatin weekly (35mg/m2 ).

Those who receive two more chemotherapy courses will be assessed clinically and by CT scan if no PD will continue to chemo and RT ,those with PD will undergo surgery Eight weeks following the completion of RT, patients will undergo a repeat direct laryngoscopy and a PET scan.

 The primary tumor site will be biopsied.

 Neck nodes that are persistent, clinically suspicious nodes, including PET positive nodes, will be biopsied.

 Patients with positive laryngeal biopsies following chemoradiation will undergo salvage surgery if possible supracricoid partial laryngectomy, otherwise laryngectomy.

 If the laryngeal biopsy is negative but clinically positive neck lymph nodes remain, patients will undergo neck nodal dissection.

 Once patients are disease-free following chemoradiation and nodal neck dissections (if needed), patients will be followed every 6 weeks in the first year, followed by every 3 months in the second, every 6 month between 2 and 5 years.

 Patients whose physical examination or whose imaging studies are concerning for recurrent disease will undergo biopsy.

 If positive, they will undergo salvage laryngectomy.

 Induction Docetaxel/Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (TPF) as Selector for Chemo Radiation Therapy (RT) Versus Partial Laryngectomy in Advanced Laryngeal Cancer@highlight

Treatment of patients with one cycle of induction chemotherapy to select for organ preservation of the larynx has been proven as a standard approach.

 When compared to historical controls.

 The investigators propose to study patients with a similar treatment strategy (i.

e.

 one cycle of induction chemotherapy followed by two more chemotherapy cycles, in advanced nodal disease, followed by chemoradiation for those responding to the initial chemotherapy.

 Those who fail to respond or fail in radiation will directly undergo surgery.

 The novelty of the proposed study is that non responders and failures will be given the opportunity of larynx preserving supracricoid laryngectomy.

 The investigators will attempt to reduce toxicity from induction chemotherapy and improve potency with the use of docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (TPF) in place of the standard regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF).

 Emerging data demonstrates that induction regimens containing triplets with platinum, 5-fluorouracil, and taxanes produce higher response rates and less overall toxicity when compared to induction strategies utilizing PF
