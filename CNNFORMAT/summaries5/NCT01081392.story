(secondQuint)Inflammatory Markers in Sputum After LPS Inhalation.

 Endotoxins are inflammatory substances present in the environment.

 In man, the inhalation of the lipopolysaccharride moiety (LPS) induces measurable immune responses.

 With an inhaled single dose of 20 micron, the inflammatory response in man is sub-clinical.

 During bronchoprovocation tests with allergens, the particle size determines to a large extent the intensity of the response.

 the response to LPS as a function of particle size is not known and will be studied in this study.

 Inflammatory Markers in Sputum After LPS Inhalation@highlight

The purpose of the study is to measure inflammatory biomarkers in sputum and peripheral blood in healthy volunteers after inhalation of single doses of LPS (20 mcg) administered as particles of different sizes.
