(fifthQuint)Nutrition Education Intervention in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Resource Poor Setting.

 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health challenge.

 Low-income individuals are among those observed to have poorer long term outcomes of diabetes management and to spend a higher proportion of their income on diabetes care.

 Therefore, diabetic individuals from resource poor settings require special attention and effective management strategies to assist them improve their health outcomes.

 Patient self-management education, including nutrition education is a feasible strategy in resource poor settings.

 The nutrition education programme in this study is based on the target group assessed needs, as tailored education is shown to be more effective in improving health outcomes.

 The experimental group will receive nutrition education in group format on a weekly basis for eight weeks, this will include a vegetable gardening component offered in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture.

 In addition written education materials will be provided (pamphlet and wall/fridge flyer).

 A follow-up intervention on a monthly basis will follow the group education.

This is to revise the learnt content and for group problem solving activities.

 The control control group will receive usual care plus the written education materials.

 Nutrition Education Intervention in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Resource Poor Setting@highlight

The purpose of this study is to implement a nutrition education programme that was developed for type 2 diabetic adults in a resource poor setting and to evaluate the programme's effectiveness on health outcomes A randomized controlled clinical trial study design will be used.

 One group (experimental group) will receive the nutrition education while the other group (control group) will receive the usual care.

 Setting: Two Community health centres in Moretele Health Sub-District, North West Province, South, Africa Effectiveness of the nutrition education will be evaluated for the following outcomes: - clinical - blood sugar control based on HbA1c levels (primary outcome) - lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density cholesterol, high density cholesterol and triglycerides) - blood pressure - body mass index - dietary intake - others -diabetes knowledge, attitudes towards diabetes Outcome measurements- at six and 12 months, this will be compared with the baseline data.

 Hypotheses: - the experimental group will have a significantly lower HbA1c compared to the control group - the experimental group will have significantly better outcomes for dietary intake, blood lipid profile, blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes knowledge and attitudes towards diabetes and its treatment.
