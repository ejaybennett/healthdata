(firstQuint)Temodar (Temozolomide), Bevacizumab, Lithium and Radiation for High Grade Glioma.

 Treatment of high grade glioma (HGG) with anti-angiogenic therapy results in clinical improvement and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS).

 However, mant patients experience diffuse recurrence and treatment failure.

 This is a phase II trial testing the feasibility of adding lithium carbonate, previously shown to have anti-invasive properties in HGG, to bevacizumab and chemoradiation following surgical resection of HGG.
