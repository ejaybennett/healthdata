(firstQuint)Effect of Nicotinic Acid on Cardiovascular Risks Indices in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.

 Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common hormone problem in young women and, as a result of it, they can experience irregular periods, reduced fertility, acne and increased body hair.

 Frequently, increased weight is a feature.

 Research suggests that they could have a higher risk of diabetes, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, angina, heart attack and stroke.

 The fat from the diet is transported from the stomach into the blood and then taken up by the liver, muscles and fat tissues to store or use as an energy source.

 Delayed removal of fat from the circulation resulting rise of fat after a meal has been known to happen in PCOS.

 High fats after a meal are a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 Niacin has been in clinical use to lower bad cholesterol and to increase good cholesterol for many years.

 It has been proved to be effective in reducing risks of heart disease in patients with diabetes.

 However the effect of niacin on reducing cardiovascular risks and reducing fat level after a meal in PCOS has not been studied and this is why we plan to do this research.

Niacin will improve postprandial hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular risks indices via its lipid lowering as well as via pleiotropic effects in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
