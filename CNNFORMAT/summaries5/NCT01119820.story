(firstQuint)Tissue Donation for Myoblast Culture.

 Study the ability of healthy human skeletal muscle to produce myoblasts, and to determine how many cells would be needed to regenerate a certain section of injured muscle.

 As part of this research, we hope to gain a better understanding of the effect of age on muscle and how normal skeletal muscle can regenerate itself by producing myoblasts.

 The information gathered from this study will be specifically used in future research for treating Anal Incontinence.

 Tissue Donation for Myoblast Culture@highlight

Analyze human skeletal muscle and learn more about the ability of adult muscle to produce myoblasts (young muscle cells).
