(secondQuint)Bioequivalence Study of Azacitidine for Injection in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Patients.

 This study is an open label, multi-center randomized, single dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, two-way cross-over, relative bioavailability study of Azacitidine for Injection for suspension use manufactured for Bioniche Pharma USA LLC compared with Vidaza(R) manufactured by Celgene Corporation in MDS patients under fasting conditions.

 Patients who are on a stable 75 mg/m2 dose of Vidaza will be randomized to study drug sequence Azacitidine on C1D1/ Vidaza(R) on C2D1 or Vidaza(R) on C1D1 / Azacitidine on C2D1.

 Randomization will be in a 2:2 ratio.

 Thirty-six (36) patients will be enrolled to ensure 28 evaluable patients.

 Patients will not be blinded to their treatment assignment.

 After randomization, fasted patients will receive 1 dose of assigned study drug (either Azacitidine for Injection or Vidaza(R)) subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on C1D1.

 On Days 2-7, they will receive their normal Vidaza(R) treatment.

 Following a 21 day rest period, patients will cross over to receive the alternate treatment on C2D1 followed by their normal Vidaza(R)) treatment on Cycle 2 Days 2-7.

 The Final Patient Visit will be conducted 7 days following the last dose of Vidaza(R).

 The total duration of the study for each patient will be up to 56 days including the Screening period and Post Study Visit.
