(fifthQuint)Bivalirudin/Prasugrel Versus Abciximab/Clopidogrel in Patients Presenting With STEMI.

 Background: In the setting of STEMI, adjunctive pharmacological therapy plays a key role in the acute management.

 Along with the clear benefit of mechanical reperfusion strategies, several drugs showed to be beneficial.

 On top of clopidogrel, heparins and IIB/IIIa glycoprotein, other drugs have been recently introduced showing encouraging results.

 These "new" drugs, namely prasugrel and bivalirudin, have only been compared separately.

 Primary hypothesis: the combination of prasugrel/bivalirudin is superior to the combination of clopidogrel and heparin/abciximab in terms of net adverse clinical events, i.

e.

 ischemic events plus hemorrhagic events Setting: - patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI Mechanical reperfusion: -primary percutaneous coronary intervention Pharmacological Interventions: - Two arms: Clopidogrel plus heparin/abciximab vs Prasugrel plus Bivalirudin Follow up: - 1 year Measurements: - efficacy end points in terms of reduction of ischemic events - safety end points in terms of reduction of bleeding events.

 Bivalirudin/Prasugrel Versus Abciximab/Clopidogrel in Patients Presenting With STEMI@highlight

In the setting of ST elevation myocardial infarction newer therapies has been recently studied and, following encouraging results, introduced into the clinical practice.

 Prasugrel showed to be a valid alternative to overcome limitation of clopidogrel therefore providing a better ischemic protection.

 On the other hand, bivalirudin is at least as beneficial as heparin/abciximab as anticoagulant agent but associated with fewer hemorrhagic events.

 The primary hypothesis of the study is that the combination of prasugrel plus bivalirudin can be associated with a better risk/benefit profile.
