(secondQuint)Do Low High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Levels Predict Treatment Outcome in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Viral Infection?.

 Lipoproteins are closely connected to the process of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

 Metabolic syndrome predicts negative treatment outcome in HCV infection.

 Aim: to assess the association between lipids components of the metabolic syndrome and sustained viral response (SVR).

 Do Low High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Levels Predict Treatment Outcome in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Viral Infection?@highlight

The working hypothesis is that the low HDL serum level predict favorable response to anti viral treatment in chronic HCV (genotype 1) viral infection.

 This might be used to improve the rate of sustained virologic response.
