(thirdQuint)Biomakers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck Previously Treated With Cisplatin With or Without Cetuximab.

 OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the association between ERCC1 expression and clinical outcomes (response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival) in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received cisplatin with versus without cetuximab on clinical trial ECOG-E5397.

 OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 expression by IHC.

 ERCC1 levels (low or high) are assessed by an H-score and AQUA, a quantitative IHC analysis.

 Each patient's ERCC1 level result is then compared with the patient's clinical outcome.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck previously treated with cisplatin with or without cetuximab.
