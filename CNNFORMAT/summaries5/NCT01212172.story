(thirdQuint)Comparison of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Two Different 810 nm Diode Lasers for Hair Reduction.

 This side-by-side split body, blinded, randomized single-center study is comparing two different 810 nm diode laser technologies for the purpose of permanent hair reduction to determine the effectiveness and subject's tolerance for hair reduction.

 Twenty volunteers will be enrolled into this study.

 Subjects will receive a total of 5 treatments of either axilla or lower legs.

 10 patients will have both axilla treated while the other 10 subjects will have the lower legs treated.

 Placement to the axilla treatment group vs.

 the lower leg treatment group is random.

 Treatment areas will be randomized to receive Soprano SHR treatment or Light Sheer/Duet treatment.

 One extremity (example: right axilla) will receive Soprano SHR treatment and the contra-lateral extremity (example: left axilla) will receive Duet treatment.

 The treatments will occur every 6 - 8 weeks and then there will be follow up visits at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after the last treatment.

 Comparison of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Two Different 810 nm Diode Lasers for Hair Reduction@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to compare two different 810 diode laser systems (Soprano XL (SHR Mode)and Light Sheer Duet) for laser hair removal.

 The goal is to determine if each laser system is effective at reducing the amount of hair on the lower legs or the axilla (arm pit).

 Another goal is determine the subject's perspective on the treatment including tolerability and effectiveness.
