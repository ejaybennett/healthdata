(firstQuint)Treatment of Primary Basal Cell Carcinomas of the Skin With Combination of Topical Imiquimod and Cryosurgery.

 Evaluation of efficacy: - Number of patient: N=50 - Inclusion criteria: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin proven with biopsy - Exclusion criteria: (1) Size of the tumors >2cm; (2) Distance from the eyelid 5 Treatment protocol: Patients will apply imiquimod daily for 14 days on the tumor and a rim of 2mm around the tumor.

 On day 14 a session of mild cryosurgery (2 cycles of 10-15 seconds, with open spray liquid nitrogen) will be applied and the patients will continue application of imiquimod for another 3 weeks before being evaluated again.

 Persisting erosion will be considered as persistence of the tumor and imiquimod will be continued for another 3 weeks with/or without a cryosurgery session.

 The patients will be evaluated at 1,3,6,12 months after discontinuation of imiquimod and yearly thereafter for relapse.

 In case of clinical relapse, it will be confirmed by biopsy.
