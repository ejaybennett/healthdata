(thirdQuint)Acute Neurocardiogenic Injury After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

.

 The cardiac metabolic disturbance are assessed by a 18F-FDG PET/CT in the first week after SAH and monthly until normal result.

 The myocardial sympathetic innervation is assessed by a cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy in the first week after SAH and six months later.

 Clinical outcome is assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale, modified Rankin Scale and MOS-SF36 at 1, 3 and 6 months after SAH.

 Acute Neurocardiogenic Injury After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

@highlight

The aim of this study is to describe acute neurocardiogenic injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage assessed with cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT during the first week and the first six months after SAH.

 The study hypothesis is that the evolution of the cardiac disturbances follows the clinical evolution.
