(thirdQuint)Liraglutide Efficacy and Action in Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.

 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is responsible for an increasing prevalence of liver disease and is becoming the commonest cause of liver disease in the western world.

 NAFLD is recognised to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities characterised by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, hypertension and dyslipidaemia.

 In its mildest form there is an accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis) without any liver damage, however in many cases it progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis.

 Current treatment options for NASH are limited in efficacy, necessitating the development of more effective options.

 New agents such as Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists that improve diabetic control and facilitate weight loss have been suggested as therapies in NASH.

 No published studies to date have assessed the impact of the GLP-1 agonist, Liraglutide, on liver histology and metabolism in obese patients with NASH.

 This study hypothesises that treatment with liraglutide will result in a significant improvement in histological disease activity in overweight patients with NASH, in the presence or absence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM).

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 48 weeks treatment with once-daily injections of liraglutide improves liver disease (liver fat, inflammation and scarring) and related metabolic parameters in overweight patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, enough to warrant further investigation.
