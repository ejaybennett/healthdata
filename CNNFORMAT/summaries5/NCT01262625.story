(fifthQuint)Randomized Evaluation of Patients With Stable Angina Comparing Diagnostic Examinations.

 The Randomized Evaluation of Patients with Stable Angina Comparing Utilization of Diagnostic Examinations (RESCUE) is a multi-center randomized, controlled trial responding to the need for comparative analysis of these imaging technologies and the role of OMT in clinical care.

 A total of 4300 patients will be randomized to CCTA or SPECT MPI/ICA for diagnostic assessment of angina at up to 80 institutions internationally.

 This study builds on the results of the COURAGE trial by comparing CCTA and SPECT MPI/ICA integrated into a care paradigm featuring initial treatment with OMT for patients diagnosed with CAD without significant disease in the left main coronary artery.

 Participants will be followed for a composite endpoint of MACE and cross-over to revascularization over a follow-up period up to two years (two to six time points depending on diagnostic results and time of enrollment into the trial).

 The primary endpoint of the study is a combined endpoint of occurrence of MACE and revascularization.

 We will calculate differences in the combined MACE/revascularization endpoint between the CCTA and SPECT MPI/ICA arms.

 Participant outcomes will be assessed by age, gender, comorbidity, and angina classification class at presentation.

 Several comparative-effectiveness analyses will be performed.

 We hypothesize that the CCTA arm will be associated with no increase in MACE or revascularization, decreased cost, reduced risks (e.

g.

, less radiation exposure), additional insights into or alternate explanations of chest pain, and increased cost-effectiveness in comparison with SPECT MPI/ICA.

 Findings are expected to result in validation of an evolving new standard of care for patients with stable angina that takes advantage of CCTA and OMT to more cost-effectively drive appropriate care while reducing the need for invasive diagnosis and increased radiation exposure with SPECT MPI/ICA.

 Randomized Evaluation of Patients With Stable Angina Comparing Diagnostic Examinations@highlight

This randomized, controlled, diagnostic, multicenter trial will compare two diagnostic imaging pathways--coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)--to determine the incidence of major adverse coronary events (MACE), defined as myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac-related death, and cross-over to revascularization.

 CCTA may be used to direct patients with symptoms of stable angina or angina equivalent to optimal medical therapy (OMT).

 The use of CCTA as a diagnostic tool for angina symptoms will be associated with no increase in MACE or revascularization, decreased cost, reduced risks (e.

g.

, less radiation exposure), additional insights into alternate explanations of chest pain, and increased cost-effectiveness in comparison with use of SPECT MPI/invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
