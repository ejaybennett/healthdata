(firstQuint)Evaluation of [18F] FMH3 and PET as a Marker of Histamine-3 Receptor Activity in Subjects With AD Compared w/ HC.

 Approximately 10 subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 8 healthy control (HC)subjects will be recruited to participate in this study.

 All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations.

 Subjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of [18F]-FMH3.

 Subjects will undergo serial PET imaging scans and plasma sampling for measurement of [18F]-FMH3 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 8 hours.

 The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, [18F]-FMH3.

 At least 2 weeks following the initial imaging visit, subjects may be asked to return for a second injection and scanning procedure to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure.

 Subjects may decline to participate in the second scan.
