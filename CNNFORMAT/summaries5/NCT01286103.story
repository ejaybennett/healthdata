(secondQuint)A Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Once-Daily and Twice-Daily Dosing With Canagliflozin in Healthy Adult Volunteers.

 This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned), single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy adult volunteers.

 Canagliflozin (a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

 Patients in Cohort 1 will be randomized to receive Treatment A (one 300-mg tablet orally, by mouth [PO] once daily for 5 days) followed 10 days later by Treatment B (one 50-mg and one 100-mg tablet PO twice daily for 5 days) or Treatment B followed by Treatment A.

 Patients in Cohort 2 will be randomized to receive Treatment C (one 100-mg tablet PO once daily for 5 days) followed 10 days later by Treatment D (one 50-mg tablet PO twice daily for 5 days) or Treatment D followed by Treatment C.
