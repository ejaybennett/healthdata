(secondQuint)Functional Outcomes of Surgical Management of Deep Endometriosis Infiltrating the Rectum.

 The study compare digestive and urinary functional outcomes following surgical management of rectal endometriosis by either colorectal resection or conservative surgery (shaving or full thickness excision of rectal nodules).

 Patients managed for rectal endometriosis are randomized in two arms, and followed up for 24 months.

 The assessment of digestive and urinary functions is performed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months using standardized questionnaires.

 Postoperative complications and improvement of endometriosis related pain are also recorded.

 Functional Outcomes of Surgical Management of Deep Endometriosis Infiltrating the Rectum@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether performing colorectal resection in deep endometriosis infiltrating the rectum is responsible for a higher rate of postoperative digestive and urinary dysfunction when compared to rectal nodules excision (conservation of the rectum).
