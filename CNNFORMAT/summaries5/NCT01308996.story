(firstQuint)Clinical Study of INFUSE Bone Graft Compared to Autogenous Bone Graft for Vertical Ridge Augmentation.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate INFUSE(R) Bone Graft as an alternative to autograft for alveolar ridge bone formation in the posterior mandible prior to dental implants.

 A subject must have a defect behind the canine of 2-4 teeth for at least 2 months and be a candidate for dental implants.
