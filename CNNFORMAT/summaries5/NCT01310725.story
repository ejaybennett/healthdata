(thirdQuint)Evaluation of Graft Material in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).

 Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting are included in the study.

 Each patient receive a radial artery graft and a vein graft harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue to the right and left side of the heart respectively.

 The left internal mammary artery is used for the left anterior descending artery in a skeletonised or non-skeletonised fashion.

 The evaluation is made with angiography up to 5 years after surgery.

 Evaluation of Graft Material in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)@highlight

The aim of the study is to evaluate the patency in different kinds of vessels used as graft material in coronary artery bypass grafting.

 The hypothesis is that vein grafts harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue have the same, or better, patency compared to radial grafts and that skeletonisation of the left internal mammary artery does not effect the patency for this graft.
