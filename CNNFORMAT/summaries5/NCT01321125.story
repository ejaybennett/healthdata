(thirdQuint)Chlorhexidine Against Sodium Hypochlorite as Skin Antiseptics.

 Sodium hypochlorite at 10% has been widely used as antiseptic in patients on dialysis as well as for irrigation of wounds and burns.

 Since it has been used successfully in caring for the exit side of hemodialysis catheters, it is reasonable to propose its use for the insertion and care of central intravascular catheters, as well as for skin preparation before surgery.

 Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the agent most commonly used, are costly or ineffective.

 In a recent study perform by our group it was demonstrated that 10% sodium hypochlorite was not inferior than povidone-iodine.

 It has been demonstrated as well that 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol is superior to povidone-iodine.

 The aim of this study is to know if 10% sodium hypochlorite has a similar effect that the best current option for skin antisepsis.

 Chlorhexidine Against Sodium Hypochlorite as Skin Antiseptics@highlight

The physicians have few options for skin antisepsis.

 Alternatives for common use antiseptics are costly or ineffective.

 In order to have more options, this study is needed.

 The investigators want to know if there are differences between the use of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol or 10% sodium hypochlorite.
