(secondQuint)High Sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) and Copeptin as Prognostic Parameters in Patients With Elective Total Endoprosthesis.

 Consecutively, high sensitive troponin T and copeptin will be measured in all patients with elective knee and hip endoprosthesis in the orthopedic department of the University of Heidelberg.

 The blood is taken during the routine blood testes if possible, on admission and the days 1-4 following the operation.

 Usual baseline characteristics are taken as well as usual blood results (hb, cholesterol and so on).

 Primary endpoint is the detection of perioperative myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.

 High Sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) and Copeptin as Prognostic Parameters in Patients With Elective Total Endoprosthesis@highlight

Summary: The purpose of the study is to prove if the biomarker high sensitive troponin T (hsTnT) and the biomarker of endogenous stress copeptin can serve as surrogate parameter of prognosis in patients with elective knee and hip total endoprosthesis.
