(secondQuint)Relevance of Biomarkers in the Process of Weaning.

 Artificially ventilated patients on our intensive care unit will be monitored if specific biomarkers have a relevance in risk stratification, optimizing therapy, outcome and success in the process of weaning.

 Therefore, consecutively, specific blood parameters will be taken at time of intubation,day 1 of weaning and extubation.
