(firstQuint)Compare Sacrospinous Fixation Versus High Uterosacral Ligament Fixation for Uterus Vaginal Prolapse III/IV.

 Hysterectomy is often the traditional approach for women with uterovaginal prolapse.

 However, hysterectomy alone does not address the underlying problem of deficient apical support.

 Surgical options for patients with apical prolapse include transvaginal suspension procedures using pelvic structures for fixation, such as the sacrospinous ligament or uterosacral ligaments.

The objective of this study is to compare the sacrospinous fixation with high uterosacral in the treatment of uterine prolapse POP-Q stage 3 or 4 in terms of recurrence of prolapse,quality of life,complications,post-operative recovery, hospital stay.
