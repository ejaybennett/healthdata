(firstQuint)Influence of Extracorporeal Circulation on Platelet Function of Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.

 Patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery are planned to be included.

 At several intra- and postoperative measuring point, blood is drawn for multiple electrode aggregometry to investigate ex-vivo platelet aggregation as a surrogate for platelet function.

 Transfusion rate of allogenic blood products as well as postoperative blood loss is planned to be recorded.
