(fifthQuint)Low Dose OC Therapy in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Impact of BMI on Hyperandrogenism.

 Clinically, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder of functional androgen excess and the features of PCOS can run through a spectrum of severity.

 The optimal modality for long-term treatment of PCOS should positively influence androgen synthesis, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production, insulin sensitivity, the lipid profile, and clinical symptoms including hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles.

 Combined oral contraceptives have been a key component of the chronic treatment of women with PCOS; improving androgen excess and regulating menstrual cycles.

 The effect of OCs on ovarian folliculogenesis significantly decreases androgen production.

 This mechanism was confirmed in both healthy women and women with PCOS.

 In obese patients with PCOS, it is likely that the suppression of androgen production is not as significant.

 It is thus possible to hypothesize that the effects of OCs in PCOS could be dependent on body weight and what is needed is a head-to-head comparison.

 The aim of this study is to compare the effect of 6 months of a low-dose oral contraceptive regimen of 24/4 DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.

02mg/levomefolate calcium 0.

451 mg on androgen profiles, cardiometabolic measures, B-vitamin status, and menstrual cycle regulation in three groups, normal (BMI 18-24.

9 kg/ m2) overweight (BMI 25-29.

9 kg/ m2) and obese (BMI 30-35 kg/ m2) women with PCOS.

 Low Dose OC Therapy in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Impact of BMI on Hyperandrogenism@highlight

The classic description of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is that it is a disorder characterized by menstrual irregularity, chronic anovulation, androgen excess, and abnormal gonadotropin secretion.

 Use of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) in women with PCOS effectively reduces circulating androgens.

 Although OCs are the most common and one of the oldest symptomatic treatment modalities for androgenic skin symptoms and for irregular menstrual cycles caused by hyperandrogenism, the data concerning the effect of treatment of PCOS women with different body mass index (BMI) are limited.

 This study is being done to compare the hormone and metabolic changes after treatment with low-dose oral birth control regimen of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.

02mg/levomefolate calcium 0.

451 mg (Beyaz cent ) in women with PCOS with different body weights.
