(firstQuint)Oral Alfacalcidol and Coronary Artery Calcification in Predialysis Chronic Kidney Disease.

 Active vitamin D compound is used frequently in the treatment of hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease.

 Recent evidence from animal studies suggested that low dose of active vitamin D may be protective against vascular calcification, whereas high dose could precipitate it.

 The present study will examine the effect of low dose oral alfacalcidol on coronary artery calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients with hyperparathyroidism.

Active vitamin D at therapeutic dose may prevent vascular calcification but in supraphysiologic dose may precipitate it.
