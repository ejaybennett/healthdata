(firstQuint)Antimicrobial Activity of IV Clear Dressing - Prevention of Antimicrobial Regrowth.

 A single center, within-subject randomized study design in healthy adult subjects with a history of high bacteria counts on their upper back, meeting the inclusion criteria.

 Antimicrobial efficacy will be measured by determining the mean number of Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per square centimetre (cm) of skin prior to treatment (baseline measurement), following preparation with 70% isopropyl alcohol, and following post treatment samples.

 The goal of this study is to demonstrate that IV Clear cent is as effective as or better than Tegaderm cent CHG dressing in preventing regrowth of cutaneous microbial flora on test subjects.
