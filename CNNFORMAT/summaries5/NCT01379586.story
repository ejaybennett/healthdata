(thirdQuint)A Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in Healthy Volunteers.

 This is a first-in-human study of ONO-4053 in healthy volunteers.

 This study consists of three parts.

 Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when single ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner.

 Part B will investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in the fed and fasted state in an open-label manner.

 Part C will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when multiple ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner.

 Doses for Part B and C will be determined after data from Part A are available.
