(thirdQuint)PDM08 Clinical Trial in Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Phase I study, open, dose escalation, in adult patients with advanced solid tumours, to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending PDM08 doses administered twice a week cycles of 4 weeks.

 After checking the safety of the first drug doses, a new dose escalation was proposed and approved by the Ethic Committee and the Medicines Agency.

 This clinical trial is carried out in adult patients with advanced solid tumours whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which there is no standard antineoplastic therapy, or are refractory to it.

 In pharmacodynamic non clinical studies, PDM08 presented antitumour activity against different tumour models including, renal, colon, lung, prostate and breast cancer models.
