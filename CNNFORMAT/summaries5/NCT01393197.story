(secondQuint)Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization With KMG Microsphere Treating Advance-stage Hepatocellular Carinomas (TACE-KMG).

 The most important part of effect in TACE is embolization .

But there is no clinical trials on which one is better,KMG microsphere or lipiodol? what effect did chemo play in the TACE treating HCC? Which one is better,routine dose or low dose? Experts in USA and Japan had their own researches and standpoints.

We think it is important to push a clinical trail to answer these problem.

 Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization With KMG Microsphere Treating Advance-stage Hepatocellular Carinomas (TACE-KMG)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with KMG microsphere in treating HCC.

 And to determine which one is better,KMG microsphere or lipiodol?
