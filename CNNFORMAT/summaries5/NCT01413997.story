(firstQuint)Connective Tissue Motion Measure.

 The differential motion between specific connective tissue strata will be measured during tissue displacement (linear oscillation) initiated by a computer-controlled needle stimulus tool (NST).

 The CTMM will be suitable as an outcome measure for mechanistic and clinical studies of CAM interventions.

 The CTMM also will potentially serve as a clinical diagnostic and treatment-monitoring tool for manual therapists, acupuncturists, and CAM clinicians interested in assessing the functional status of a patient's connective tissue.

The goal of this project is to develop a biomarker - the Connective Tissue Motion Measure (CTMM) -quantifying the functional behavior of perimuscular connective tissues.
