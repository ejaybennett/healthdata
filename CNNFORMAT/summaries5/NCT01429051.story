 This is a clinical trial with 12 weeks treatment of Intranasal fentanyl (INFS) in cancer patients with breakthrough pain (BTP).

 It was composed of a dose titrated, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, cross-over efficacy phase, combined with a titration and a tolerability phase assessing the safety and nasal tolerability of INFS.

 The trial is set up with a screening period and three treatment phases: a titration phase (I), an efficacy phase (II) and a tolerability phase (III).

 The entire trial period for each completed patient consisted of the one week screening period and 12 weeks treatment with INFS.
