(firstQuint)Lens Wear Schedules and End-of-Day Comfort.

 This study was conducted in a cross-over design with two phases.

 Each phase consisted of four cycles approximately 12 hours in length.

 During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for 2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80 minutes.

 A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear.

 A 12-hour lens-free wear period preceded each phase.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of lens-free (recovery) intervals of varying lengths on end-of-day comfort and tear film changes with daily contact lens wear.
