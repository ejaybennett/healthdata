(firstQuint)Chloroquine in Combination With VELCADE and Cyclophosphamide for Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Chloroquine may help chemotherapy drugs work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

 Giving bortezomib and cyclophosphamide together with chloroquine may kill more cancer cells.
