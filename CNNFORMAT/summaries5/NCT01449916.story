(thirdQuint)Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol in Zambia.

 In recent years, evidence-based protocols of bundled therapies have improved survival of severe sepsis in developed countries.

 However, in sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such as IV fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized.

 Furthermore, although tuberculosis is a common cause of severe sepsis in the region, accurate and timely diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis remains elusive.

 The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based protocol for severe sepsis, (2) To evaluate the cost of implementation for a simplified severe sepsis protocol (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic score for identifying tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis (4) To assess the performance of the Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis.

 Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol in Zambia@highlight

This study is a randomized control trial assessing the impact of a simple evidence-based protocol for the treatment severe sepsis in Zambia.

 The intervention protocol consists of a scheduled fluid regimen, early blood culture and antibiotics, and dopamine and blood transfusion when necessary.

 It is hypothesized that the protocol will significantly decrease in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis.
