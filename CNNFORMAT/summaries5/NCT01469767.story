(firstQuint)Efficacy of Fluocinonide Cream 0.

1% (Vanos(R)) in Reducing Itch in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of short-term treatment with fluocinonide cream 0.

1% (Vanos(R)) in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).

 Our hypothesis is that subjects will have a reduction in Investigator's Global Assessment scores at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline.

 Secondary objectives include the use of actigraphy monitoring to determine the ability of Vanos(R) cream to reduce itch, and thus nocturnal scratching, in AD.

 Our hypothesis is that subjects will have a reduction in nocturnal scratching activity, as measured by actigraphy movement count per hour, at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline.

 Other secondary outcome measures include Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, body surface area involvement and Visual Analog Scale for itch.

 The investigators hypothesize that each of these measures will be improved at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline.
