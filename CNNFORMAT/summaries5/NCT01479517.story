(secondQuint)Open-Label Study of Efficacy and Recommended Dose of Kovacaine Mist for Anesthetizing Maxillary Teeth.

 This is a Phase II single-center, open-label clinical trial with three dosing regimens, designed to determine the efficacy and optimal dose of the Kovacaine Mist intranasal delivery system for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4-13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar).

 Kovacaine will be administered intranasally on the same side of the midline as the tooth on which the procedure will be performed in three dosing cohorts [four 100 1/2L, two 200 1/2L, or one 200 1/2L spray(s)] of 10 subjects each.

 The first cohort receiving 4 sprays will be completed before initiating study of the remaining two cohorts, which will be treated using a randomized, parallel-group design.

 Administration: Subjects in the 4- and 2-spray cohorts will be administered the same total dose of 12 mg tetracaine HCl/0.

2 mg oxymetazoline HCl.

 The 4-spray cohort will be treated with a sequence of four 100-1/2L sprays at intervals of 4 minutes.

 The 2-spray cohort will be treated with a sequence of two 200 1/2L sprays 4 minutes apart.

 The 1-spray cohort will be administered one 200 1/2L spray, a total dose of 6 mg tetracaine HCl/0.

1 mg oxymetazoline HCl, which is half the dose of the 2-spray cohort.

 Rescue: If the study drug does not provide sufficient anesthesia to allow for completion of the dental procedure, a rescue injection of articaine will be administered.
