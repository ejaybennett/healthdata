(fifthQuint)90 Y-BC8-DOTA Monoclonal Antibody, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Total-Body Irradiation Followed by Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the tissue localization of 111In-BC8-DOTA antibody therapy (Ab) and establish reproducibly favorable biodistribution.

 II.

 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation delivered via 90Y-BC8-DOTA Ab when combined with fludarabine phosphate (FLU) and 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) as a preparative regimen followed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related or unrelated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for patients with multiple myeloma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the potential efficacy of this approach, within the limits of a phase I study, by examining disease response, duration of remission, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 (90Y-BC8 Ab).

 Patients receive 90Y-BC8 Ab intravenously (IV) on day -12 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2.

 Patients undergo TBI and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

 Patients also receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180 or on days -3 to 100 with taper to 180; and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO BID on days 0-27, or 0-40 with taper to 96.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

 Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

 When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8, fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening and may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.
