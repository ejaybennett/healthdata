(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of a Breast Cancer Vaccine Plus Poly-ICLC for Breast Cancer.

 The study is a single arm, open label, pilot study of safety and immune efficacy of peptide vaccination with poly-ICLC in patients with stage IB-IIIA resected breast cancer.

 Participants will be patients who have completed their last dose/treatment of any single treatment or combination of adjuvant surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or trastuzumab therapy between 45 days and 6 months (180 days) prior to enrollment.

 Each vaccination will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, and 78.

 All participants will receive 9 class I MHC-restricted synthetic peptides (restricted by HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31) and a class II MHC-restricted tetanus helper peptide mixed with 1mg poly-ICLC and administered in sterile water.

 The vaccine will be administered intramuscular (IM) (1 ml) and intradermally (ID) (1 ml) at vaccination sites in the arm and leg.

 (Each vaccine given IM and ID at one site; site to alternate between arm site opposite the breast cancer and an anterior thigh site.

) Participants will be screened for HLA type and must be HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31 (80% of the Virginia population in prior studies1).

 Annual follow-up for progression and survival for 3 years after study withdrawal/completion.

 Pilot Study of a Breast Cancer Vaccine Plus Poly-ICLC for Breast Cancer@highlight

Despite advances in surgical, radiation and medical therapies of early stage breast cancer, some patients will experience disease recurrence.

 Because recurrence may not happen for years after definitive treatment, there is a period of time between resection and relapse when micrometastatic disease may be amenable to immune eradication or modulation.

 While the ultimate goal of any cancer treatment is clinical efficacy, the immediate urgency in breast immunotherapy is to define treatments that have immunologic efficacy.

 In this study, the investigators will determine whether a vaccine consisting of nine-class I breast specific peptides plus a class II tetanus toxoid helper peptide is immunogenic when administered with poly-ICLC to participants with stage IB to IIIA breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.
