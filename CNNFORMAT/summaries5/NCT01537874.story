(secondQuint)MassCONECT (Massachusetts Community Networks to Eliminate Cancer Disparities Through Education) 4 Kids: Promoting Smoke-free Homes.

 Involuntary secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in homes is an entirely preventable public health threat that disproportionately burdens young children in communities of low socioeconomic position.

 Breathe Free For Kids is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative to evaluate the effectiveness of Ml compared with usual best practices (UBP) by having parents voluntarily adopt smoke-free home policies to protect children from SHS.

 The Motivational Interviewing intervention protocol was developed in conjunction with community partners, integrated into a health department-sponsored home visiting program for high-risk children and other community-based agencies serving children, and delivered by trained community health workers.
