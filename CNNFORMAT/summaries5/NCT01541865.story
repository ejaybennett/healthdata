(secondQuint)Treatment of Resistant Hypertension Using a Radiofrequency Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty Catheter.

 This study will evaluate the hypothesis that the Vessix V2 Renal Denervation System can be employed to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 6 months as compared to pre-treatment baseline blood pressures.

 Patient blood pressure will be measured by in the office according to recognized international techniques and standards.

 Procedural success shall be defined as ability to complete the renal denervation treatment using the V2 balloon catheter device and RF generator.
