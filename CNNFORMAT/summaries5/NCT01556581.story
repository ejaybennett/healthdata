(fifthQuint)Comparative Effectiveness of Early Physical Therapy Versus Usual Care for Low Back Pain.

 The specific aims of this study are the following: 1.

 Compare the effectiveness of two primary care management strategies for patients with a recent onset of combat-related LBP.

 We hypothesize early physical therapy access for these Soldiers will result in greater improvements in function and quality of life over 1 year as compared to a stepped care strategy.

 2.

 Compare the subsequent healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies for patients with a recent onset combat-related LBP.

 We hypothesize early physical therapy access will result in decreased healthcare utilization over 1 year as compared to a stepped care strategy.

 3.

 Evaluate the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of treatment.

 Comparative Effectiveness of Early Physical Therapy Versus Usual Care for Low Back Pain@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two management strategies for patients with a recent onset of low back pain (LBP).

 One is based on usual care and the other is based on early access to physical therapy following a pragmatic treatment-based classification approach.

 The secondary purposes are to compare the subsequent healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies as well as to evaluate the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of treatment.

 The overall hypothesis guiding the study is that the additional initial treatment expense incurred by early implementation will result in superior short-term clinical effectiveness, and will be more cost-effective in the long-term due to reduced healthcare utilization.

 We will also explore the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both treatment groups, which may provide insights for further improving treatment strategies.
