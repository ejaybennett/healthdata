(secondQuint)Role of Proteasomes in a Dermatological Autoimmune Disease: Bullous Pemphigoid.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: To compare the following parameters between the 3 groups: - plasmatic proteasome concentrations - plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity To explore the potential relationships between: - plasmatic proteasome concentrations - plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity - plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations - measures of disease severity for dermatological auto-immune diseases To characterize plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibodies in patients suffering from bullous pemphigoide and other dermatological auto-immune diseases (other bullous auto immune diseases: pemphigus, cutaneous lupus, .

.

.

).

 To characterize the expression and the activity of proteasomes in skin samples, in plasma and in circulating mononuclear cells in patients with bullous pemphigoide.

 Role of Proteasomes in a Dermatological Autoimmune Disease: Bullous Pemphigoid@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to describe and compare plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations among three distinct groups: (1) patients suffering from bullous pemphigoide; (2) patients suffering from other dermatological auto-immune diseases; (3) an elderly control group.
