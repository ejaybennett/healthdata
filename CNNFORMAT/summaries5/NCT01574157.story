(secondQuint)Investigations of the Optimum Serum Bicarbonate Level in Renal Disease.

.

 Diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common problem in Veterans and progresses to end-stage renal disease in many people.

 It is important to identify treatment strategies that will help prevent the progression of CKD to overt kidney failure.

 The purpose of this study is to see if sodium bicarbonate reduces urinary markers of kidney damage in Veterans with diabetic CKD and normal serum bicarbonate levels.
