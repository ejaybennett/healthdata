 This is a feasibility study to examine if an intervention in a primary care setting can recruit and retain adolescents and young adults and influence future planning behaviors.

 We will address the following research Aims: 1.

 To assess the feasibility of a career development program provided to low income adolescents and young adults in a pediatric primary care setting.

 To assess the receptiveness of adolescents and young adults in pediatric primary care setting to future planning interventions.

 3.

 The Healthy Futures Program is an interactive, multi-session training program.

 There will be participants in 3 different intervention tracks (College/vocational school, Job, and Career Planning).

 Tracks are assigned to participants based on interest and age.

 During the screening process, participants who are 16 years old or older will be asked if they are interested in participating in a program designed to help them apply to college or job training services.

 Based on their preference, they will be assigned a college or job track.

 Participants who are 14 and 15 years old will automatically be assigned to the career planning track.
