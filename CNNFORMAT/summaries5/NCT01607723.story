(thirdQuint)"NAVA-PAV" Study: a Cross-over Comparative Study of 2 Advanced Modes.

 Twenty patients will be enrolled.

 They will be ventilated with PAV+ and NAVA for one day, each in a randomized crossover order.

 The oxygenation,ventilator comfort, patients -ventilator asynchronies, and sleep pattern will be compared.

 "NAVA-PAV" Study: a Cross-over Comparative Study of 2 Advanced Modes@highlight

Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and Proportional Assist Ventilatory Plus (PAV +) are new modes of mechanical ventilation that delivers ventilatory assist in proportion to the electrical activity of the diaphragm for NAVA and to patients efforts for PAV +.

 The goal of this trial is to compare oxygenation,ventilator comfort, patients -ventilator asynchronies, and sleep pattern between NAVA and PAV+.
