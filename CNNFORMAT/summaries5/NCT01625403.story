(secondQuint)Recombinant BNP on Heart and Renal Function in Acute Heart Failure.

 Patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and acute renal injury (AKI) will be randomized to receive standard of care with or without additional rhBNP.

 Clinical heart function, LVEF, SCr, GFR and other laboratory parameters will be evaluated.
