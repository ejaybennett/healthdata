(firstQuint)Chemo-immunotherapy (Gemcitabine, Interferon-alpha 2b and p53 SLP) in Patients With Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer.

 Recurrent ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis and there is a pressing need to identify more efficient therapies.

 Ovarian cancer is highly immunogenic and good survival is tightly linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells and the absence of immunosuppressive immune cells.

 This anti-tumor immune response might be primed by chemotherapy.

 Gemcitabine has immune-modulatory properties in addition to its direct cytotoxic effect in platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

 Additionally, Peg-Intron allows the full maturation of dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response.

 Moreover, the tumor-associated self-antigen p53 is commonly over-expressed in ovarian cancer and can serve as a target for immunotherapy.

 Therefore, chemo-immunotherapy with gemcitabine and Peg-Intron plus/minus p53 SLP vaccination seems an attractive treatment for recurrent, p53+ ovarian cancer patients.

This study investigates the feasibility and immunogenicity of the triple combination of gemcitabine, Peg-Intron and p53 SLP vaccination in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
