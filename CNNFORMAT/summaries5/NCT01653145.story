(fifthQuint)Positive Energy I Through Overfeeding.

 The purpose of this trial is to examine the metabolic and behavioral effects of a positive energy balance induced by adding food to the usual level of activity.

 During this study, we will induce a positive energy balance for two days by increasing food intake to 140% of baseline energy requirements and keeping energy expenditure constant.

 The following three diets, which vary in dietary fat and energy density (kcal/g), will be used to induce the positive energy balance in a within subjects or cross over design: 1) high fat/high energy density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density.

 Food intake and activity will be measured for 4 days after each diet to quantify the response to positive energy balance and manipulation of dietary fat and energy density.

 Positive Energy I Through Overfeeding@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to examine the metabolic and behavioral effects of a positive energy balance induced by adding food to the usual level of activity.

 It is hypothesized that: 1) food intake will not differ significantly after 2 days of positive energy balance induced by a high carbohydrate vs.

 high fat diet when both diets are low in energy density, and 2) food intake will be higher after a positive energy balance induced by a high fat/high energy dense diet vs.

 a high fat/low energy dense diet.
