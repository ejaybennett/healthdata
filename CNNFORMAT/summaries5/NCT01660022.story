(firstQuint)Safety Tolerability & Pharmacokinetics of Co-administered Single Doses of OZ439 & Piperaquine to Healthy Subjects.

 Placebo-controlled, double-blind, five-cohort, 2-period (per cohort) dose-escalation study.

 For each subject, the study included a screening evaluation (within 21 days of the 1st dose), dosing on 2 separate occasions (Period 1 and Period 2) and a follow-up visit (6 weeks following the final dose).

 Within each cohort, subjects were randomised into two sequences to receive OZ439 in Period 1 and OZ439 plus piperaquine in Period 2 (sequence 1, 8 subjects) or OZ439-matching placebo in Period 1 and OZ439/piperaquine matching placebos in Period 2 (sequence 2, 4 subjects).

 Safety and tolerability were evaluated: Physical examination, ECG assessments including a full baseline matched profile of ECG tracings, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, in particular liver function tests and adverse events.
