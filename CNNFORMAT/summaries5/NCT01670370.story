(firstQuint)Trial of R-GemOx Regimen in Previously Untreated Elderly Patients With DLBCL.

.

 Previous studies showed that the combination of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) achieved high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in relapsed and refractory DLBCL.

 This regimen might be considered a putative treatment option for elderly patients.

 To our knowledge, the efficacy and safety of R-GemOx when given as first-line therapy in elderly patients with DLBCL remains unknown.

 The investigators therefore developed a two-weekly regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen as first line treatment in elderly DLBCL and investigate its efficacy and safety.
