(secondQuint)Telemedicine as a Means to Achieving Good Diabetes Control Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Type-2-diabetes is a growing healthcare problem.

 Both because of the increasing amount of patients and because of the complications of diabetes.

 Non-pharmacological treatment is considered fundamental in the treatment of patients with type-2-diabetes.

 In the Community of Copenhagen, all patients diagnosed with diabetes receive rehabilitation.

 The rehabilitation consists of counseling with regards to nutrition, physical activity, smoking cessation and education about diabetes.

 Some patients however, remain poorly regulated despite rehabilitation as well as pharmacological treatment.

 A total number of 165 patients will be randomized to intervention group or standard care.
