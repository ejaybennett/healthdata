(thirdQuint)Xenon Combined With Intraoperative Thoracic Epidural Analgesia.

 The first step is divided into 3 parts.

 9 patients will be sequentially enrolled (3 patients in each part).

 The patients will be followed during 45 days and the following rules will be used to assess the safety: First part: if no toxicity: initiation of the randomised part.

 If 1/3 toxicity: start of the second part.

 If 2 or 3/3 toxicity: end of the study.

 Second part: same rules and possible start of the third part.

 Third part: if no toxicity: initiation of the randomised part.
