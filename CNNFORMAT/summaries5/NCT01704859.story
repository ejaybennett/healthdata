(fifthQuint)Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids (VITAL Trial): Effects on Fractures.

 The VITAL: Effects on Fracture Study is an ancillary study of the parent VITAL trial (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL).

 The study will require the adjudication of all self-reported incident fracture events among 25,874 men and women.

 Findings from this ancillary study will inform clinical practice on the role(s) of vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplements in fracture prevention.

 Because of the very high prevalence of low vitamin D levels and fractures in older adults, this trial will enable us to prove or disprove whether high-dose vitamin D and/or fish oil supplementation is effective in the primary prevention of age-related osteoporotic fractures in the U.

S.

 These nutritional supplements may offer low-cost preventative interventions and reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures with the potential for substantial individual and public health benefits.

 Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids (VITAL Trial): Effects on Fractures@highlight

The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is a randomized clinical trial in 25,874 U.

S.

 men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these illnesses.

 This ancillary study is being conducted among participants in VITAL and will examine whether vitamin D or fish oil will (1) reduce incident total fractures and (2) reduce incident hip and non-vertebral fractures.
