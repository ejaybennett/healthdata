(firstQuint)Availability of Poor Quality Embryos.

 Day-3 poor quality embryos are related to significant lower clinical pregnancy,so freezing numerous poor quality embryos are clinical impractical.

 To ensure the successful pregnancy and to enhance the availability of the poor quality embryos, day-3 poor quality embryos are further cultured to different developmental stage and then cryopreserved.

 The viability of these embryos are tested in frozen-thawed transfer.
