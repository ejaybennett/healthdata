(firstQuint)Long-Term Follow-Up of Transplanted Human Central Nervous System Stem Cells (HuCNS-SC) in Spinal Cord Trauma Subjects.

 The investigation is a multi-year observational study following the completion of the open-label, single dose Phase I/II study involving transplantation of allogeneic HuCNS-SC cells into 12 subjects with thoracic spinal cord injury.

 Subjects will be monitored at routine intervals for safety and preliminary efficacy for four years.

 The LTFU study will commence following the one year post-transplantation termination visit of the Phase I/II investigation.
