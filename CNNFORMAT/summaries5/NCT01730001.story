(secondQuint)Early Versus Late Intubation Trial in Physician Manned Emergency Medical Services.

 The ELITE trial is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare competent EARLY-intubation to LATE-intubation in patients with on-scene Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9 and short ambulance transport times (< 20 min) to hospital.

 The study aims to establish if advanced airway management with endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the field by specially trained Emergency Medical Services (EMS) physicians - compared to endotracheal intubation (ETI) performed by physicians in the emergency department in the same group - improves outcome in terms of 30-day mortality, degree of disability at discharge, complications and length of hospital stay, and neurologic outcome at 6 months.
