(firstQuint)Validation of Hand Held Dynamometer for Assessment of Lower Limb Muscle Strength in Multiple Sclerosis.

 Purpose of this study is to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of a hand-held dynamometer (HHD) in the assessment of lower limb strength in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

 Also to establish a standardized strength testing procedure for key lower limb muscle groups using a HHD fo research and clinical purposes in Multiple Sclerosis.
