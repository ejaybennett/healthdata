(firstQuint)Comparison of O-type Hybrid Knife and IT Knife in ESD.

 Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been accepted as an minimal invasive alternative to surgery for localized early upper gastrointestinal neoplasms recently.

 However, the procedure remains to be technically challenging and time consuming.

 Many modified methods or newly developed devices were developed to simplify the procedure.

 A new insulated tip dissecting knife (O-type Hybrid knife) has been recently developed with both injection and lateral cutting capability.

 The aim of this study was to investigate whether ESD procedure could be shortened with this new device.

By combining injection and dissection capability together, O-type Hybrid knife could possibly shorten the endoscopic submucosal dissection procedure for upper gastrointestinal neoplasms.
