(thirdQuint)Quality of Life in Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiosurgery.

 Study Design (for example, hypothesis, research question, standard and experimental procedures, special or unusual equipment or procedures): The main goal of this study is to evaluate quality of life outcomes and changes in patient reported symptoms (e.

g.

 urinary, bowel and sexual function) in patients receiving SBRT treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer.

 Validated quality of life questionnaires will be administered in a deidentified, prospective fashion.

 Eligible subjects will be patients undergoing SBRT treatment for prostate cancer.

 Hypothesis: Patients undergoing SBRT will have similar cancer control and symptoms as men who are treated with other radiation therapy modalities.

 Primary objective: To evaluate quality of life outcomes (e.

g.

 fatigue, urinary, bowel and sexual function) for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with SBRT.

 Secondary objectives: Prospective data on cancer control and toxicity following SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer.

 Quality of Life in Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiosurgery@highlight

Quality of life data following SBRT for prostate cancer has been obtained in only a small numbers of patients.

 A prospective study using validated quality of life questionnaires is needed to determine outcomes after treatment with SBRT.

 Our study will be the first essential step in developing a better evidence base on the comparative risks and benefits of SBRT treatment with regards to quality of life assessment and outcomes.
