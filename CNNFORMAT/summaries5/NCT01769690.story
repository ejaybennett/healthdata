(secondQuint)The Effect of Low Frequency STN DBS on Sleep and Vigilance in Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients.

 In the proposed study, we will use a within-subject randomized clinical trial to measure objective changes in sleep architecture with DBS "on" and to compare effects of different DBS stimulation parameters on sleep architecture as measured by sleep studies.

 The study design will allow us to address our hypothesis that low frequency deep brain stimulation parameters are more effective than the conventional settings at improving sleep architecture and wake-time vigilance.

 If our hypothesis is correct, low frequency settings could be used during sleep and this would prolong stimulator battery life, therefore decreasing the frequency of required surgical battery changes for DBS.

 These data will be valuable in considering clinical treatment strategies and provide insight into the basic mechanisms of sleep dysfunction in PD.

 The study may also contribute to understanding how to achieve maximum clinical benefit from DBS while minimizing morbidity and cost.

 The Effect of Low Frequency STN DBS on Sleep and Vigilance in Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients@highlight

The study design is a within-subject randomized cross-over design to evaluate the effects of DBS on sleep architecture, as measured by polysomnography, and on wake-time vigilance, as measured by a virtual reality street-crossing simulator.
