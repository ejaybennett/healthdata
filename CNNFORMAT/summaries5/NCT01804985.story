(fifthQuint)De- Escalation and Stopping Treatment of Imatinib, Nilotinib or sprYcel in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.

 The next definitive UK phase III trial in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) will be SPIRIT3, which will open shortly.

 This will incorporate a de-escalation and stopping strategy for patients who achieve excellent responses after at least 3 years of treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

 DESTINY is to act as a pilot for this strategy in SPIRIT3, by defining the proportion of patients that relapse during 12 months of TKI de-escalation followed by 24 months of cessation.

 DESTINY also includes scientific bolt-on studies, quality of life assessments and health economic evaluation.

 De- Escalation and Stopping Treatment of Imatinib, Nilotinib or sprYcel in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether some patients with excellent responses to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) treatment are being overtreated, and can remain well on either a lower dose of treatment or without treatment at all.

 The dose of imatinib (Glivec), nilotinib (Tasigna) or dasatinib (Sprycel) treatment will initially be cut to half the standard dose for 12 months, and then treatment will be stopped completely for a further two years.

 The trial information will also help to develop a de-escalation and stopping strategy for future newly diagnosed CML patients in the next British national CML study (to be known as SPIRIT3).
