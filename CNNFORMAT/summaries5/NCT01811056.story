(secondQuint)Exploring a Patient-centered Approach to Mifepristone Administration in Medical Abortion.

 This study will investigate the uptake of mifepristone administration outside of the health center for pregnancy termination and its acceptability to women and to their providers.

 In addition, we plan to evaluate rates of follow-up, adherence, efficacy, complications, days of missed work and/or school, and lost income.

 This will be a prospective, comparative, non-randomized, open-label study.

 All women who are seeking medical abortion will be offered participation in the study.

 Women who enroll in the study will be given a choice between taking the mifepristone outside the center or in the center setting.
