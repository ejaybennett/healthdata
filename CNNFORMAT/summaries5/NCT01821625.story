(fifthQuint)Study of Quadruple Therapy With Eltrombopag for Chronic Hepatitis C.

 SQUELCH-C is an investigator-initiated, single arm, non-blinded pilot study on the use of eltrombopag in combination with ribavirin, pegylated-interferon, and boceprevir, for patients who would not otherwise be treatment candidates because of low platelet counts (less than 75x10^9/L).

 Administration of the drugs ribavirin and boceprevir will be standard of care, with one exception for interferon.

 The total drug treatment period for the study patient will range from 32 - 56 weeks, depending on liver disease stage and viral response.

 Follow-up will take place at 12 and 24 weeks post treatment to evaluate for sustained viral response.

 Total study participation may require 1.

5 years.

 Study of Quadruple Therapy With Eltrombopag for Chronic Hepatitis C@highlight

This study will provide chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with low platelets (less than 75x10^9/L) the opportunity to undergo treatment and possible cure of their virus.

 The main hepatitis C drugs will be administered as standard of care, with the addition of the study drug eltrombopag.

 The investigators hypothesize that providing eltrombopag to CHC patients with low platelets (less than 75x10^9/L) will permit the initiation and completion of antiviral triple therapy with boceprevir, ribavirin, and pegylated-interferon.
