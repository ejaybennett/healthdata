(secondQuint)Metabolic and Cognitive Parameters Following Partial Sleep Deprivation.

 It is predicted that partial sleep deprivation negatively affects the hormonal status, e.

g.

 upregulating ghrelin and other hunger-promoting hunger hormones, while showing impaired memory functions.

 It is also predicted that participants will tend to increase their desired portion sizes after partial sleep deprivation, compared with after a normal night's sleep.
