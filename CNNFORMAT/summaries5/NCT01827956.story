(fifthQuint)Role of FCRIIIA and FCRIIA Receptor Polymorphisms.

 Hypothesis: Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, is used with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced and inoperable upper aerodigestive tract cancers.

 Actually, no predictive biomarkers of Cetuximab antitumor activity are known in this setting.

 It has been shown recently that FCRIIIA and FCRIIA receptor polymorphisms played a role in antitumor activity of trastuzumab and cetuximab.

 We therefore hypothesized that FCRIIIA and FCRIIA receptor polymorphisms may play a predictive role in Cetuximab effectiveness in upper aerodigestive tract cancers with recurrence or metastatic disease that make them inaccessible to loco regional treatment.

 This study is a multicentre prospective pharmacogenetic observational study, conducted on locally advanced and inoperable upper aerodigestive tract cancers.
