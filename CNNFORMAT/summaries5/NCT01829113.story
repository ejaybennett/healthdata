(secondQuint)Phase II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed +/- OGX-427 in Untreated Stage IV Non-Squamous-Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

 Modern doublet chemotherapy improves survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with supportive care alone, with non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with platinum/pemetrexed living longer than patients treated with platinum/gemcitabine.

 Despite these advances, poor outcomes with advanced disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action.

 Preclinical evidence in lung cancer models shows promising antitumor activity with OGX-427 in combination with platinum based therapy or pemetrexed.

 In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study, pemetrexed and carboplatin plus OGX-427 followed by maintenance pemetrexed and OGX-427 will be compared with pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by maintenance pemetrexed and placebo in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

This randomized phase II study will compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed with and without OGX-427 in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
