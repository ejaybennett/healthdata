(secondQuint)Safety and Effectiveness Study of CPI-613 and/or Gemcitabine to Treat Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.

 Data from dose-escalated Phase I trials indicate that CPI-613 is safe and effective against metastatic pancreatic cancer (Lee et al.

 2012; Retter et al.

 2012).

 Accordingly, this Phase II trial is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 Primary Outcome Measure: - Overall Survival (OS) Secondary Outcome Measures: - Changes in CA 19-9 - Quality of Life (QOL) assessment - Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Safety.
