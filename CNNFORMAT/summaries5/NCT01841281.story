(fifthQuint)L-arginine in Severe Asthma Patients Grouped by Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels.

 We hypothesize that a subset of adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care medications.

 We hypothesize that these patients will have lower exhaled NO concentrations ( 25 ppb.

 The major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy to define the underlying mechanisms of arginine benefit in asthma.

 This follows our initial 20 subject trial of L-arginine in asthma subjects (Kenyon et al.

, Pharmaceuticals 2011) that was designed to determine how L-arginine was metabolized (by testing serum markers) and whether certain participants had clinical benefit.

 To do this, we will recruit a total of 50 ATS-defined severe asthmatic subjects with ongoing asthma exacerbations in past two months and enroll them in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over designed trial of L-arginine and placebo.

 We will compare 25 subjects with "low" FeNO 25 ppb.

The major impact of this study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy.

 The investigators hypothesize that a subset of adult severe asthma patients will respond to supplemental L-arginine and derive clinical benefit from the addition of this therapy to standard-of-care asthma medications.

 The investigators hypothesize that the patients that benefit most will have low exhaled nitric oxide concentrations (< 20 ppb) at baseline.
