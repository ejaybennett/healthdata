(firstQuint)Safety of Autologous M2 Macrophage in Treatment of Non-Acute Stroke Patients.

 Our primary hypothesis is that autologous M2 macrophage transplantation via intrathecal introduction is feasible and safe after non-acute stroke.

 Our secondary hypothesis is that autologous M2 macrophage transplantation is associated with improved neurological outcome after non-acute stroke.
