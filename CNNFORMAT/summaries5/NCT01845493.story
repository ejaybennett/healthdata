(secondQuint)Sulforaphane Supplementation in Atopic Asthmatics.

 This pilot study will examine if oral SFN supplementation can induce NRF2 and NRF2-dependent phase II enzymes in nasal epithelial cells of allergic asthmatics.

 Subjects will receive both a SFN-rich broccosprout homogenate preparation and an alfalfa sprout homogenate (placebo) in a crossover fashion.

 mRNA levels of NRF2 and NRF2-dependent phase II enzymes will be compared between the active and placebo periods.

The investigators will perform a pilot study of daily treatment with oral sulforaphane (SFN) for 3 days to determine if Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) induction is possible with this supplementation regimen in individuals with allergic asthma.
