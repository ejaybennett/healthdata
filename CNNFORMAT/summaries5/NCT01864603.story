(fifthQuint)Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health.

 The SEARCH study aims to test evidenced-based innovative community based interventions that lead to the elimination of HIV in rural communities in East Africa using a multi-disease approach.

 The first phase of the study will quantify the health, economic and educational impact of early HIV diagnosis using a streamlined and immediate ART (antiretroviral therapy).

 This first phase will be completed in July 2017.

 The second phase of the study, will quantify the health, economic and educational impact of targeted Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), targeted HIV testing and targeted care interventions in the context of universal treatment and streamlined care.

 This second phase will be completed in July 2020.

 The study intervention is designed to improve the entire continuum of care, to reduce structural barriers for all populations including those most "at risk".

 Primary endpoint for the first and second phase is HIV incidence measured 3 years follow up.
