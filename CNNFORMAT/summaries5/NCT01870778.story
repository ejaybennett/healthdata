(firstQuint)Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Serelaxin When Added to Standard Therapy in AHF.

 This Phase IIIb outcome study in AHF patients was designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study in order to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous infusion of serelaxin or placebo.

 The AHF patients randomized to either serelaxin or placebo in the study were followed for a period of 180 days, and were required to receive standard-of-care background HF management during both the index hospitalization and post discharge according to regional or local guidelines/institutional standards.
