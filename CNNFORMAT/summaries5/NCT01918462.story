(firstQuint)Protective Immune Mechanisms in Alcoholic Hepatitis.

 The investigators will study hepatic biopsies from patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

 In these biopsies, the investigators will assess the production of IL-22 and which cells produce the cytokine.

 The investigators will study the expression of the IL-22 receptor and also the production of the IL-22 binding protein, which can inhibit the actions of the cytokine.
