(firstQuint)Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells Therapy in Liver Cirrhosis.

 Decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), a life-threatening complication of chronic liver disease, is one of the major indications for liver transplantation.

 Recently, umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells transfusion has been shown to lead to the regression of liver fibrosis in animal model.

 The investigators thus investigated the safety of the therapy with life signs like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality and so on.

 And the efficacy was evaluated with the measurement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), albumin (ALB), cholinesterase (CHE), prothrombin time (PT) and child-pugh score.
