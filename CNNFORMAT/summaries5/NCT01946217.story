 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To identify participant-level factors affecting recruitment of potentially eligible participants in AIDS Malignancy Clinical Trials Consortium (AMC) studies at core and affiliated sites.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To describe the socio-demographic characteristics for participation and non-participation in AMC clinical trials among all approached volunteers across AMC sites.

 II.

 To characterize socio-demographic characteristics with motivation and decision making among those who consented to participate in an AMC trial.

 III.

 To identify the perceived barriers associated with clinical trial participation among those who did not consent to participate in an AMC clinical trial.
