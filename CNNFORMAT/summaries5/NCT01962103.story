(thirdQuint)To Find a Safe Dose and Show Early Clinical Activity of Weekly Nab-paclitaxel in Pediatric Patients With Recurrent/ Refractory Solid Tumors.

 ABI-007-PST-001 is a Phase 1 / 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study to assess the safety , tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding brain tumors).

 The Phase 1 portion of the study, with a dose escalation design, ended and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined as 240 mg/m2 IV in patients weighing > 10 kg and 11.

5 mg/kg in patients weighing 10 kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle .

 The Phase 2 portion of the study will enroll additional patients at the RP2D into one of three solid tumor groups [Neuroblastomas, Rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing's Sarcomas].

 Both phases of the study are open-label and conducted at multiple centers.

 The Phase 2 is using a Simon two-stage design to monitor patient enrollment for each group separately.

 The Rhabdomyosarcoma group did not reach the expected number of two responders out of fourteen efficacy eligible patients.

 Consequently, this group is stopped.

 To Find a Safe Dose and Show Early Clinical Activity of Weekly Nab-paclitaxel in Pediatric Patients With Recurrent/ Refractory Solid Tumors@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find the safe dose of nab-paclitaxel in children with solid tumors, and to see if it works to treat these solid tumors in children and young adults (in phase 1 18 years old and in phase 2 24 years old).

 After the final dose has been chosen, patients will be enrolled according to the specific solid tumor type, (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or Ewing's sarcoma), to see how nab-paclitaxel works in treating these tumors.
