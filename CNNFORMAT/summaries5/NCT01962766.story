(firstQuint)Myofunctionnal Therapy on Nasal Breathing and Orthodontic Corrections Stability.

 The current research project aims to study the efficacy of myofunctional therapy and its orthodontic long-term outcomes, such as: 1) Is treating a low tongue position and lip closure at rest sufficient for orthodontic short and long-term outcomes? 2) Does treating atypical swallowing along with an incorrect tongue position help achieve and maintain higher outcomes of the myofucntional and orthodontic treatments?.
