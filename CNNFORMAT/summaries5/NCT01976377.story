(thirdQuint)Mucin Glycosylating Enzymes in Head and Neck Cancers.

 Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification of proteins.

 Aberrant glycosylation is the hallmark of most human cancers and affect many cellular properties, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, transformation, migration and immune response.

 Though widely explored in various human cancers, the role of mucin glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC has not been elucidated.

 Our aims is to analyze the expression patterns of mucin glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC tissues.

 Furthermore, we will correlate the expression levels of mucin glycosylating enzymes with clinical characteristics of HNSCC patients.

 Mucin Glycosylating Enzymes in Head and Neck Cancers@highlight

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) is the fourth common malignancy in Taiwan.

 It accounts for 5.

8% of all cancers and causes 2,463 deaths per year.

 Aberrant glycosylation is the hallmark of most human cancers, including HNSCC, and affects many cellular properties.

 This study is aimed at exploring the role of mucin glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC.
