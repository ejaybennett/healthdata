(firstQuint)Pilot Study of a Nerve Block Simulator for the Training in Axillary Blocks.

 Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are becoming the standard of care in patients requiring regional anesthesia.

 Cost-effective training is needed for the implementation of these techniques in the global anesthesia practice.

 Existing simulators are expensive and not available in low income countries.

 The investigators aimed to test an inexpensive simulator for the training in this technique.
