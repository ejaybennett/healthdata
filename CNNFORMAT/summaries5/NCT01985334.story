(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glycopyrronium or Indacaterol Maleate and Glycopyrronium Bromide Fixed-dose Combination Regarding Symptoms and Health Status in Patients With Moderate COPD Switching From Treatment With Any Standard COPD Regimen.

 The treatment epoch will last 12 weeks.

 The total duration of the study for each patient is 12 weeks (from randomization) plus 30 days of safety follow-up.

 The study has three phases: screening phase (=wash-out period, if required), treatment phase and safety follow-up phase.

 Eligible patients will be randomized to either receive glycopyrronium or indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or to remain in their baseline therapy, in an allocation ratio of 3:1 for each cluster (Groups A, B, C, and D), based on their COPD symptoms and baseline treatment: Group A: Patients treated with any SABA ( Short-acting 2-adrenergic agonist) and/or SAMA (Short-acting muscarinic antagonist) as monotherapy or in free or fixed dose combination (FDC) will be assigned to glycopyrronium or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group B: Patients treated with any LABA (Long-acting 2-adrenergic agonist) or LAMA (Long-acting muscarinic antagonist) monotherapy and mMRC score =1 point will be assigned to glycopyrronium or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group C: Patients treated with any LABA and ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) in free or FDC will be assigned to indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group D: Patients treated with any LABA or LAMA monotherapy and mMRC score >1 point will be assigned to indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1).

 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glycopyrronium or Indacaterol Maleate and Glycopyrronium Bromide Fixed-dose Combination Regarding Symptoms and Health Status in Patients With Moderate COPD Switching From Treatment With Any Standard COPD Regimen@highlight

The main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium bromide and indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination (FDC) in patients with moderate COPD who switch from their current COPD therapy.

 This study aims to provide data on how non-exacerbating, but still symptomatic patients with moderate COPD switching from their current COPD treatment to glycopyrronium bromide or indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide FDC maintain or improve their symptoms.

 Another purpose of this study is to increase awareness and usage of validated COPD symptoms tools and dyspnea questionnaires in order to facilitate clinical assessment and improve early diagnosis of symptomatic patients.
