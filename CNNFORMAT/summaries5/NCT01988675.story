(firstQuint)MRI Study of Radiation-Induced Damage to White Matter and Blood-Brain-Barrier.

 Patients will be assigned to one of two groups based on the type of radiation they will be receiving: whole brain irradiation or partial brain irradiation.

 Patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessments, neurocognitive testing (Quality of Life and Neuropsychological assessments), and clinical evaluation.

 MRI Study of Radiation-Induced Damage to White Matter and Blood-Brain-Barrier@highlight

This is a study to determine if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques can detect early changes in white matter (in the brain) and the blood-brain barrier resulting from radiation therapy.
