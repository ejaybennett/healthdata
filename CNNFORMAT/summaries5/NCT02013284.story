(secondQuint)Is Our Microbiome a Predictor of Cardiac Risk.

 Investigators will look at inflammatory markers in the blood and also look at the genome of the bacteria in the gut.

 This research is being done because Investigators believe that there is a connection between the way food is digested by a person's gut bacteria and the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and cardiovascular disease.

 The ultimate goal of this research is to eventually determine if changes to the gut bacteria can prevent cardiovascular disease or disease progression.

 Is Our Microbiome a Predictor of Cardiac Risk@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine a relationship between a person's flora/bacteria in their gut (the intestinal microbiome) and their risk of cardiovascular disease.

 Investigators will look at inflammatory markers in the blood and also look at the genome of the bacteria in the gut.
