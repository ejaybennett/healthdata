(fifthQuint)Comparison of the Influence of Different Skin Conditions on the Allergic Skin Reactivity to Epicutanous Allergen Exposure.

 The Objective is the determination of the allergic skin reactivity to epicutaneoulsy applied birch pollen allergen extract after skin preparation (microporation by P.

 By using the standard prick test the stratum corneum is overcome by a single puncture (1 mm).

 Micropores induced by P.

 It is therefore suggested that a skin preparation with micropores by P.

 Less allergen might still elicit a skin reaction which won?t be seen by a conventional prick skin test.

 Whereas skin prick test may lead to true-negative (patient shows no allergic reaction on prick skin test but is an allergy sufferer in clinic), IgE-determination may lead to false-positives (patient is determined as allergy sufferer but has no clinical symptoms).

 So the sensitivity with micropores skin preparation by P.

 Professional leads to a better understanding of the influence of different types of skin injury patterns on the allergic skin reactivity.

 Namely, how important is the role of the exposed area, the depth of injury and the keratinocyte activation.

 This will be checked in a late phase reaction evaluation.

 Comparison of the Influence of Different Skin Conditions on the Allergic Skin Reactivity to Epicutanous Allergen Exposure@highlight

It is an open-label physiological investigation of the allergic skin reactivity to epicutaneous allergen exposition in 20 allergic patients in two different skin conditions.

 The focus of the study is on the skin preparation/condition and not on the specific allergen or allergy, but for reasons of homogeneity a single allergic disease, birch pollen allergy was chosen as the basis for the testing.

 In order to evaluate the effects of the two different skin preparation techniques an intraindividual comparison of the skin reactivity in terms of the immediate phase I reaction to serial dilutions of birch pollen extracts was chosen.

 The serial dilution approach allows a dose dependent effect evaluation and comparison of the sensitivity.

 The differences will be explained mainly by the two different skin preparations allowing a quantitative comparison of these techniques.
