(secondQuint)AKT Inhibitor in Oestrogen Positive Breast Cancer.

 The principal research questions to be addressed are whether (or not) AZD5363 is "hitting its therapeutic target" sufficiently and to the extent that is required to produce efficacy in pre-clinical experiments.

 The primary endpoint markers have been selected to determine this.

 Reductions in markers of the AKT pathway and increases in markers of anti-proliferation will characterise the degree of biological activity arising from the inhibition of AKT across a range of doses of AZD5363.

To compare the effect of four and a half days treatment of a range of doses of AZD5363 on selected markers of the AKT pathway and anti-proliferation compared with placebo in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancers.

 To assess the tolerability of four and a half days treatment of AZD5363.
