(secondQuint)The Influence of Lidocaine Volume on Discomfort During Administration of Local Anesthetic.

 Healthy volunteers will receive a single subcutaneous injection digital nerve block at the base of each ring finger.

 2ml 1% lidocaine in one of the fingers, and 1 ml 2% lidocaine in the other.

 After each injection, the subject will be asked to evaluate the pain on a visual analog scale (0-100 mm).

 Additionally the sensibility will be tested with a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, to evaluate if the different methods achieve desired anesthetic effect.

 The Influence of Lidocaine Volume on Discomfort During Administration of Local Anesthetic@highlight

The aim of the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in clinical practice when administering digital nerve block with a single subcutaneous injection.

 It will be investigated whether a smaller volume of lidocaine can decrease pain during injection.
