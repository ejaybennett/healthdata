(fifthQuint)Phase I Clinical Study Combining L19-IL2 With SABR in Patients With Oligometastatic Solid Tumor.

 1.

 Tumor vasculature Profound differences exist between vascular endothelium and surrounding stroma of normal tissues and tumors.

 Tumor vasculature is extremely disorganized and tortuous.

 Vascular shunts are frequent, and distinguishing arterioles from venules can be challenging.

 Apart from the architecture, the blood flow itself is strikingly altered: it can be sluggish, sometimes stationary or even reverse.

 The endothelium in tumors proliferates rapidly and contributes to active angiogenesis.

 The direct contact of the tumor endothelium with the host's blood pool makes this site a unique target for selective drug delivery.

 2.

 L19 Fibronectin (FN) is a broadly present soluble constituent of plasma and other body fluids.

 FN usually exists as a dimer formed by two nearly identical (approximately 250 kDa) subunits covalently linked near their C-terminus by a pair of disulfide bonds.

 Even though FN molecules are the product of a single gene, the resulting protein can exist in multiple forms that arise from alternative spicing of pre-mRNA that can generate up to 20 variants in humans.

 Splicing occurs in 3 regions of the FN gene, leading to inclusion or exclusion of either one of the two type III repeats, named EDB and EDA.

 The 91 amino acid sequence of EDB is identical in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans.

 EDB-containing FN is dispensable during embryogenesis, but is thought to play a modulating role in the growth of connective tissues.

 In adults, EDB-FN is highly expressed in normal tissues during angiogenesis, but not in mature vessels.

 Furthermore, EDB-containing FN is abundantly found in solid tumors.

 It is mainly produced by tumor cells and deposited in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

 L19 is the single chain (scFv) human antibody that specifically targets EDB-FN.

 Antibody fragments in small scFv formats are useful and versatile tools with various advantages including rapid blood clearance and easy manipulation for antibody engineering.

 The L19 antibody has been shown to recognize and target EDB-FN in vivo both in animal models and patients.

 In past years, the L19 antibody has been conjugated with numerous agents, including therapeutic radionuclides, and cytokines.

 3.

 Interleukin-2 Cytokines are a heterogeneous group of soluble small polypeptides or glycoproteins exerting pleiotropic or redundant effects promoting growth, differentiation, and activation of normal cells.

 Cytokines produced by immune cells may have pro- or anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities.

 In malignant diseases, cytokine production and release can be affected by the tumor itself and/or therapeutic interventions.

 Cytokines may also display potent anticancer activities, but are frequently hampered by treatment-related toxicities prohibiting dose-escalation to therapeutically effective concentrations.

 Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses.

 Even though it has no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a potent cell-mediated response.

 As such, IL2 is one of the treatment options in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.

 4.

 L19-IL2 In order to overcome toxicity while simultaneously delivering therapeutic doses of IL2 to the tumor issue, the elegant option of combining the anti-EDB scFv L19 antibody with IL2 was pursued.

 It has been shown that the L19-IL2 conjugate mediates the selective delivery and accumulation of IL2 at tumor endothelial cells, where the EDB antigen is expressed during angiogenesis, leading to a dramatic increase of the therapeutic efficacy of IL2.

 In the first preclinical study, 80% of the xenograft tumors (including teratocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer) tackled with L19-IL2 were subsequently composed of connective and necrotic tissue.

 At the same time an increase in the levels of interferon-gamma and of cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells was found.

 These histological and therapeutic effects were underlined in a orthotopic pancreatic cancer model treated with the antibody-cytokine conjugate.

 One year later, this response percentage was repeated in Ramos lymphoma xenografts treated with L19-IL2 and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab whereby a complete remission lasting for more than one year was found in 4 of the 5 mice treated.

 In a recent phase I/II clinical trial, the use of L19-IL2 was proven safe in a variety of stage IV malignancies with a recommended dose of 22.

5 Mio IU.

 Furthermore, it was safely combined with dacarbazine in stage IV melanoma patients maintaining the same recommended dose level.

 In the first study, the overall objective response rate was reported to be 51% after two cycles, and in the second this rate was 28% with one complete response still ongoing 21 months after treatment initiation.

 At present, three phase I/II clinical trials on L19-IL2 alone or in combination with chemotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma (ClinicalTrials.

gov numbers: NCT01055522 and NCT01253096) and pancreatic cancer (ClinicalTrials.

 Phase I Clinical Study Combining L19-IL2 With SABR in Patients With Oligometastatic Solid Tumor@highlight

The formation of metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality.

 In spite of recent advances in oncologic therapy, approximately 50 % of the lung cancer patients have already overt disseminated cancer at diagnosis.

 Additionally, numerous patients with locoregional disease initially treated with curative intent develop (oligo)metastases during the course of disease.

 In both instances, these stage IV patients are generally considered to be incurable and mostly treated palliatively.

 Oligometastases, defined as 1-5 sites of active disease on whole body imaging, was coined to refer to isolated sites of metastasis resembling limited tumor metastatic capacity.

 The implication of this concept is that local cancer treatments are curative in a proportion of patients with metastases and that incorporating local therapy is a conceptually attractive approach.

 In several, but not all, academic centers the standard treatment of patients with oligometastases in good general health is standard chemotherapy followed by surgery or by Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) with radical dose on the macroscopic visible tumors.

 The widespread introduction of SABR and of minimally invasive surgery has fuelled research in treating patients with oligometastases.

 Indeed, local control of metastases can be obtained in virtually all parts of the body with a low proportion of patients experiencing severe side effects.

 In the few prospective studies published to date, approximately 20% of patients remained free of recurrence several years after treatment when all sites of disease were targeted by radiation.

 Along with standard anti-cancer therapeutic modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), immunotherapy has recently gained a lot of attention.

 Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and therefore, considerable efforts have been made to exploit this unique target for selective drug delivery.

 One of the appealing targets for both approaches is the splice variant of fibronectin containing extra domain B (EDB), which is abundantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of a variety of primary tumors as well as metastases , but virtually absent in normal tissues.

 Recently, a human recombinant scFv fragment directed against EDB, designated L19, was developed and subsequently combined with the pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 (IL2), resulting in the immunocytokine L19-IL2.

 L19-IL2 delivers high doses of IL2 to the (metastatic) tumor site(s) exploiting the selective expression of EDB on newly formed blood vessels.

 Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses.

 Even though it has no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a potent cell-mediated response.

 In summary, L19-IL2 is an immunocytokine which will stimulate immune response specifically in tumors with angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.

 Radiotherapy is a particularly interesting partner for immunotherapy, since it can be harnessed to specifically modify the immunogenicity of the primary tumors and their microenvironment, in the attempt to generate an in situ immunization of the host against a patient's own cancer.

 Our hypothesis is that three independent therapeutic approaches will synergize to improve dramatically survival in patients with oligometastases of solid tumors.
