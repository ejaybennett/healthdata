(secondQuint)Aerobic Exercise on Ventilatory Efficiency in CAD Patients.

 Measurements of ventilatory efficiency during cardiorespiratory exercise testing typically expressed as the minute ventilation/ carbon dioxide production ratio have been validated to be useful in assessing the presence and severity of both heart and lung diseases.

 In this context, previous studies have showed ventilatory inefficiency in patients with coronary artery disease suggests abnormalities in the distribution of ventilation and perfusion in the lungs.

 In addition, a growing body of studies has demonstrated that lower ventilatory efficiency during exercise is considered an important predictor of risk mortality, hospitalization, and other outcomes than peak VO2.

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that patients with coronary artery disease with lower aerobic fitness exhibit greater responsiveness on improving ventilatory efficiency after aerobic exercise training.
