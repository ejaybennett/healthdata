(thirdQuint)The PALP-COPD Trial (Low-Flow CO2-Removal (ECCO2-R) in Exacerbated COPD).

 Primary Study Objectives cent To evaluate the clinical effect of PALP cent in reducing the time on invasive ventilation in patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

 Secondary Study Objectives - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PALP cent in patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

 - To determine if rates of adverse events (AEs) are reduced in patients who receive PALP cent and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

 - To determine mortality rates in patients who receive PALP cent and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

 - To determine if PALP cent will effectively reduce the number of subsequent acute decompensations requiring hospital admission for ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive).
