(thirdQuint)A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the VEGFR-FGFR Inhibitor, Lucitanib, Given to Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Lung Cancer and FGF, VEGF, or PDGF Related Genetic Alterations.

 Lucitanib is an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR 1-3, VEGFR 1-3, and PDGFR /.

 Lucitanib has demonstrated potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity in vitro proliferation assays and in vivo using human tumor xenograft models, with a trend for stronger efficacy in those with genomic aberrancies of FGF or PDGF.

 Abnormalities in the FGF, VEGF, and PDGF-related genes are observed across lung cancer histologies.

 The first in human trial of lucitanib demonstrated that daily lucitanib is clinically active in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 Specifically, patients with FGFR1-amplification appeared to derive particular benefit from lucitanib.

 Based on these results, this study is designed to explore the safety and anti-tumor activity of daily lucitanib in lung cancer patients with FGF, VEGF, and PDGF genetic alterations.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether lucitanib is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic lung cancer and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF), or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) related genetic alterations.
