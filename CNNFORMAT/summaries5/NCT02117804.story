(fifthQuint)Early Screen for Discharge Planning in Community Hospitals.

 Patients who are hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons who consent to the study will be screened within 24 hours of hospital admission using the Early Screen for Discharge Planning (ESDP).

 The ESDP is a four-item screening tool used to determine on admission which patients are likely to have complex discharge plans and could benefit from early engagement of discharge planning personnel.

 The ESDP yields a total score, and those with a score of 10 or greater are considered to have a "high score" and likely to have a complex discharge plan.

 Those with a score of 9 or below have a "low score".

 The ESDP screen has been proven to be valid in large academic medical centers.

 This study will determine if the screen performs with the same validity in a small community hospital.

 Early Screen for Discharge Planning in Community Hospitals@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive performance of the Early Screen for Discharge Planning (ESDP) tool in a regional community hospital.

 The central hypothesis is that the ESDP differentiates between patients in a regional community hospital who would benefit from those who would not benefit from early discharge-planning intervention as measured by problems and unmet continuing care needs, quality of life, length of stay, and referrals to post-acute services.
