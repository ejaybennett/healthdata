(secondQuint)Transepithelial Corneal Cross-linking Using Iontophoresis.

 Keratoconus is a progressive corneal ecstatic disease causing visual impairment by inducing irregular astigmatism and corneal opacities.

 This disorder typically begins during the second decade of life and, in severe forms, may need a corneal transplantation.

 Corneal cross-linking is a procedure intended to halt keratoconus progression.

 It creates links between stromal proteins in order to stiffen the corneal tissue.

 Standard CL includes epithelial removal and stroma soaking with dextran-enriched 0.

1% riboflavin solution for 30 minutes before being exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation using a 3mW/cm2 lamp for 30 minutes.

 Epithelial debridement expose the cornea to a risk of side effects, such as pain for the first two post-operative days, temporary loss of visual acuity during the first three months, and serious complications such as infection and stromal opacity due to corneal scarring.

 Iontophoresis is a non invasive technique in which a weak electric current is used to enhance the penetration of hypotonic 0.

1% riboflavin-5-phosphate solution into the corneal stroma through the intact epithelium.

 After iontophoresis, the corneal tissue is irradiated using a 10 mW/cm2 for 9 minutes (T-ionto CL).

 From previous experimental work (Lombardo M.

 et al.

 JCRS 2014 and JCRS 2015), the investigators provided evidence that TCCionto increases the stiffness of human corneas with results almost comparable with standard CL.

 The new procedure thus holds the promise to be as effective as the standard procedure while minimizing all the related risks.

 It is object of the present clinical trial to randomize patients with progressive keratoconus to T-ionto CL and standard CL and compare efficacy and safety of treatments.

 Transepithelial Corneal Cross-linking Using Iontophoresis@highlight

The purpose of the present Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) is to compare the efficacy and safety of transepithelial corneal cross-linking using iontophoresis (T-ionto CL) to treat progressive keratoconus in comparison with standard cross-linking (standard CL).
