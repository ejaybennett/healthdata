(secondQuint)Positioning of Surgical Patients With Sleep Apnea.

 This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will comprise of two stages.

 Stage 1 is a pilot study of 30 patients at high risk or diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea who are scheduled for routine surgery.

 These patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to standard of care (0 degree bed angle), 30 degree bed angle, or 60 degree bed angle.

 Acute hypoxic events will be analyzed pre and post-op in the randomly assigned bed position.

 PACU nurses will also be surveyed for patient-favored non-supine positioning (30 vs.

 60 degrees).

 Stage 2 will be a larger, powered trial to evaluate the efficacy of just one bed angle (30 or 60 degrees) based on the Stage 1 results.

 Positioning of Surgical Patients With Sleep Apnea@highlight

The study aims to evaluate the effect of non-supine positioning in the treatment of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

 The hypothesis is that non-supine positioning will result in a decrease in acute hypoxic events, defined as the number of apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep.
