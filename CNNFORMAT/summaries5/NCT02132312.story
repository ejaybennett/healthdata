(secondQuint)A Randomized Study in Children Ages Birth Through Three Years Undergoing Unilateral Cataract Extraction With or Without Lens Replacement.

 This study is a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, phenylephrine-controlled study of OMS302 in young children ages birth through three years undergoing unilateral cataract extraction.

 Administration of test irrigation solutions will take place in a double-masked fashion.

 Intraoperative pupil size will be determined by measurement of pupil diameter from still photos captured from video recordings of the procedure.

 Pupil diameter measurements will be performed immediately prior to the initial incision and at one-minute intervals until the end of the procedure (wound closure).

 Pain will be assessed by the Alder Hey Triage Pain Score.

 A Randomized Study in Children Ages Birth Through Three Years Undergoing Unilateral Cataract Extraction With or Without Lens Replacement@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of OMS302 compared to phenylephrine when administered in irrigation solution during cataract extraction on intraoperative pupil diameter, acute postoperative pain, and safety in children birth through 3 years.
