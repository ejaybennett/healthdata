(thirdQuint)Study of 6-Thioguanine in Combination With 6-Mercaptopurine During Maintenance Therapy of Childhood Lymphoma.

 MTX/6MP maintenance therapy is challenged by treatment related liver toxicity, failure to achieve the target treatment parameter in all patients, and lack of direct parameters for monitoring treatment efficacy or even intensity.

 Patients with low activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of 6MP, have lower levels of liver toxic metabolites (MeMPs), higher levels of the major active metabolites (TGNs), and reduced relapse rates.

 Most patients (90%) have high TPMT activity.

 Nearly all patients with high TPMT activity and high MeMP levels experience elevated liver enzymes.

 Increasing the 6MP dose in patients with high TPMT activity, to intensify therapy, will mainly lead to further increase in the MeMP level.

 A novel approach compensating the adverse thiopurine metabolism of the majority of patients is warranted.

The purpose of this phase 1-2 study is to explore the applicability of supplementing standard methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine (MTX/6MP) maintenance therapy of children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with 6-thioguanine (6TG).

 The investigators hypothesize that addition of 6TG to 6MP-based maintenance therapy of patients with high TPMT activity will mimic the more favourable thiopurine metabolism of patients with low TPMT activity and ultimately reduce relapse rates.
