 Efficacy Study of an Unloading Brace for Knee Osteoarthritis@highlight

Subjects with symptomatic unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee will be invited to participate in this randomized study.

 Subjects will be assigned to either a Fusion Osteoarthritis Knee Brace group, or a control group that does not wear a brace.

 It is hypothesized that use of the Fusion Osteoarthritis Knee Brace will have a better outcome on osteoarthritis knee pain and quality of life compared to those who do not receive bracing intervention.
