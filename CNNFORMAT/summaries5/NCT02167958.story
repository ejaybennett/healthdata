(firstQuint)Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using Related, HLA-Haploidentical Donors: A Pilot Trial of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) as the Donor Source.

 This is a pilot study to assess the safety and potential efficacy of haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen and post-transplant cyclophosphamide.

 The overall objective of this study is to collect the efficacy and safety data to provide the basis to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted in this setting.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether stem cells collected from a donor's blood stream will be as safe and effective as using bone marrow collected from a donor's pelvic bone.
