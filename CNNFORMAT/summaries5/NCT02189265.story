(secondQuint)Assessing the Impact of Smoke-free Legislation on Perinatal Health in the Netherlands.

 Primary research questions 1.

 Is the phased introduction of smoke-free legislation in The Netherlands associated with reductions in adverse perinatal outcomes (e.

g.

 perinatal mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age)? 2.

 How do these associations compare with those described for other European countries in comparable studies (i.

e.

 Belgium (Cox 2013), England (Been et al under review), Scotland (Mackay 2012))? Study design Retrospective cohort study (using prospective routinely collected health care data) Study population All singleton births in the Netherlands between January 1st 2000 and December 31st 2011.

 Intervention The intervention under study is the ban on smoking in workplaces, and in bars and restaurants implemented in the Netherlands on January 1st, 2004 and July 1st, 2008, respectively.

 Inclusion and exclusion criteria We will include all registered singleton births in the Netherlands occurring between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2011.

 This is the maximum time period surrounding the ban's introduction for which the required birth data are available through the data source.

 Multiple pregnancies, neonates with chromosomal anomalies, pregnancies with unknown gestational age, pregnancies that ended before 24 weeks and pregnancies resulting in the birth of a child weighing less than 500 grams will be excluded.

 Outcome The primary outcomes are: - Perinatal mortality (stillbirth + early neonatal mortality, i.

e.

 within the first 7 days of life) - Preterm birth (live birth with gestational age 20 cigarettes daily).

 We will consider performing subgroup analyses of the impact of smoke-free legislation on the primary outcomes according to maternal smoking status during pregnancy.

 In a sensitivity analysis we will investigate whether smoke-free legislation has any differential impact on spontaneous preterm birth versus medically indicated preterm birth.

 All analyses will be performed using Stata 13.

 Assessing the Impact of Smoke-free Legislation on Perinatal Health in the Netherlands@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there has been a change in perinatal outcomes following the phased smoking ban introduction (January 2004 for workplaces; July 2008 for bars and restaurants) workplaces in the Netherlands.
