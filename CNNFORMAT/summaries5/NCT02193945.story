(thirdQuint)A Retrospective Chart Review of Patients Treated With Ocriplasmin for Symptomatic VMA.

 This study (TG-MV-022) is a retrospective study utilizing Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients treated previously with JETREA(R) for VMA.

 The objectives of this study are to retrospectively review and further characterize anatomic and symptomatic changes over six months immediately following treatment of VMA with JETREA(R) (ocriplasmin), including incidence, time to onset and resolution of anatomy and symptoms.

 The retrospective study will collect Heidelberg Spectralis(R) SD-OCT images which will be masked and uploaded to a Central Reading Center (CRC) for review and analysis.

 The CRC will evaluate anatomic endpoints of interest from both baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and all follow-up OCT scans over the 6 month follow up period.

 Endpoints of interest include ellipsoid zone disruption, development of subretinal fluid, resolution of VMA and macular hole changes.

 Further, trained clinical personnel at the participating centers will transcribe data from the patients' records, to be entered into the study database.
