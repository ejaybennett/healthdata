(thirdQuint)Phase IB Trial of LDE225 and Paclitaxel in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

 Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecologic cancer with a fairly low long-term cure rate.

 LDE225 is a new type of drug that inhibits or blocks a pathway responsible for cancer cell growth.

 LDE225 is an investigational drug that has been used either solely or in combination with chemotherapy in other types of cancer but not in ovarian cancer.

 Research evidence suggests that by combining LDE225 and paclitaxel together, ovarian cancer cells may become more responsive to treatment.

 Phase IB Trial of LDE225 and Paclitaxel in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find out if a new drug, LDE225, is safe and has beneficial effects when combined with paclitaxel in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

 Platinum resistant ovarian cancer refers to recurrent ovarian cancer that has undergone chemotherapy inclusive of a platinum compound (e.

g.

 carboplatin or cisplatin).
