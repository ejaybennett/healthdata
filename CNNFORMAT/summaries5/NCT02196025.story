(fifthQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment of Insomnia.

 Insomnia is a common clinical problem that affects about 25 million people in the US.

 Insomnia exacts health and economic consequences well beyond inadequate and non-restorative sleep.

 It increases healthcare costs, causes or adds to medical and psychiatric comorbidities, cognitive impairments, accidents, absenteeism and reduced quality of life.

 Treatment of insomnia is difficult and usually needs a multimodal approach incorporating various cognitive and behavioral approaches in addition to medication treatment.

 TMS and other neurophysiological studies have shown presence of a diffuse cortical hyper-arousal in patients with chronic insomnia.

 High frequency TMS (>1 Hz) has been shown to be activating whereas low frequency TMS (<1Hz) has been shown to be inhibitory in clinical and neurophysiological studies.

 TMS has been approved as a treatment of depression in patients who have not responded to a trial of at least one antidepressant medication.

 The goal of this study is to translate the knowledge learned from neurophysiological studies of insomnia to the clinical treatment of insomnia using TMS as the primary modality.

 Aim: Compare the change in insomnia scores between baseline and end of treatment with bifrontal low frequency TMS stimulation in 20 patients with primary insomnia using daily stimulation of 3 weeks (15 week days).

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment of Insomnia@highlight

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been approved as a treatment of depression in patients that have not responded to a trial of one antidepressant medication.

 The investigators hypothesize that low frequency TMS exerts inhibitory effect on hyper excitable cortical state in patients with chronic insomnia and therefore is therapeutic.

 The investigators want to compare the change in insomnia scores between baseline and end of treatment in an open label trial with bifrontal low frequency TMS stimulation in 20 patients with primary insomnia using daily stimulation of 3 weeks (15 week days).
