(thirdQuint)Imaging the Duodenum Using an Optical Frequency Domain Imaging OFDI Capsule.

 Subjects including healthy volunteers as well as patients with Celiac disease will be recruited and asked to swallow the OFDI capsule while being awake and unsedated.

 The capsule is attached to a tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum using natural propulsive force called peristalsis.

 As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the duodenum are acquired.

 Images are analyzed at a later stage.

The study is being done to assess the tolerability and feasibility of a tethered OFDI capsule to image the duodenum.

 A total of 24 subjects will be asked to swallow the tethered capsule, while they are awake and unsedated and ask for their feedback.

 Images will be taken using the OFDI system while the capsule travels from the esophagus into the stomach and into the duodenum.
