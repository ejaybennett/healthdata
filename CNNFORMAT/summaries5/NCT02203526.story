(fifthQuint)Phase 1 Study of Ibrutinib and Immuno-Chemotherapy Using Dose-Adjusted-Temozolomide, Etoposide, Doxil, Dexamethasone, Ibrutinib,Rituximab (DA-TEDDI-R) in Primary CNS Lymphoma.

 BACKGROUND: - Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

 - The outcome for patients with this diagnosis is significantly worse than for that of systemic DLBCL.

 Most treatment approaches in the past have included high dose methotrexate and radiation treatment.

 - Most PCNSLs appear to be of activated B-cell (ABC) origin.

 - Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and effective for systemic DLBCL of ABC origin.

 - We propose doing a study in which ibrutinib is combined with a novel chemotherapy platform called dose adjusted temozolomide, etoposide, doxil, dexamethasone, ibrutinib, rituximab (DA-TEDDI-R).

 OBJECTIVE: -To identify the dose of ibrutinib (not to exceed 840 mg per dose) with voriconazole that can be safely administered to achieve an ibrutinib median CSF CMAX of 1.

98 nM (Range 0.

69 to 11.

1).

 ELIGIBILITY: - Relapsed/refractory PCNSL.

 - Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

 - No pregnant or breast-feeding women.

 - Adequate organ function (defined in protocol).

 STUDY DESIGN: - This is a phase 1 study of 52 patients.

 - The study will have three components.

 1.

 Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib achieves a concentration of less than or equal to 100 nM in the CSF, when given in combination with DA-TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first.

 2.

 Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib dose with DA-TEDDI-R in 10 patients.

 Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.

 3.

 Cohorts A, B and C: Effective with Amendment G, 3 new cohorts (A, B and C) are being added to provide anti-fungal prophylaxis and to determine the dose of ibrutinib that will be given with voriconazole.

 OBJECTIVE: - Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib or the dose that achieves adequate CSF concentrations, whichever comes first, when ibrutinib is given with DA-TEDDI-R.

 ELIGIBILITY: - Newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory PCNSL.

 - Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

 - No pregnant or breast-feeding women.

 - Adequate organ function (defined in protocol).

 STUDY DESIGN: - This is a phase 1 study of 40 patients.

 - The study will have two components.

 1.

 Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib achieves a concentration of less than or equal to 100 nM in the CSF, when given in combination with DA-TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first.

 2.

 Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory or previously untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib dose with DA-TEDDI-R in 10 patients.

 Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.
