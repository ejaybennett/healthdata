(firstQuint)Electrical Nerve Block for Amputation Pain.

 The Altius System is an implanted device designed to electrically block nerve signals and alleviate pain.

 Use of this device may be associated with providing an effective, mechanism-based yet non-destructive, treatment for managing intractable limb pain in amputees.

 In a given patient, the Altius System will be deemed effective if treatment results in 50% reduction of pain score for more than 50% of all pain episodes.
