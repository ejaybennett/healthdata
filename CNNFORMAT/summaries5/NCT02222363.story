(firstQuint)Study of Safety and Tolerability of VLX600, an Iron Chelator, in Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This Phase I, open label dose escalation study of VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors will determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600 when administered by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle.

 Dose escalation will proceed according to the standard "3 + 3" design using doubling doses.

 The doses are: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600.
