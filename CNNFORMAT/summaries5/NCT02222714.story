(thirdQuint)Safety Evaluation of 3K3A-APC in Ischemic Stroke.

 This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded Phase 2 study intended to evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of 3K3A-APC following treatment with tPA, mechanical thrombectomy or both in subjects with moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke.

 Approximately 115 subjects will be randomized, which includes the planned 88 subjects in groups of four to either 3K3A-APC or placebo (in a 3:1 ratio) and the additional placebo subjects who will be enrolled during safety review pauses.

 This study will utilize a modified version of the continual reassessment method (CRM) in order to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 Eligible subjects will receive 3K3A-APC or placebo every 12 hours for up to 5 doses (approximately 3 days), or until discharge from the hospital, whichever occurs first.

 Subjects will be monitored for safety evaluations through Day 7 (or discharge, if earlier) and are expected to be seen on Day 7, 14, 30 and 90 for safety and outcome evaluations.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of multiple ascending intravenous doses of 3K3A-APC, a Recombinant Variant of Human activated protein C (APC), in in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke following treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), mechanical thrombectomy or both.
