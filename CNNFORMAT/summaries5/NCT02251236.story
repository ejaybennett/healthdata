(fifthQuint)Elvitegravir (EVG) Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pharmacokinetics in HIV-Infected Individuals.

 The proposed project will be a prospective, open-label treatment trial of 14 HIV-infected adults.

 Participants will be enrolled in two tracks.

 Track A will enroll participants who have been taking E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF for at least 12 weeks.

 Track B will enroll participants who are not taking ART and no prior exposure to elvitegravir and no genotypic drug resistance to any component of E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF.

 CSF and blood will be collected twice in Track A (two on-treatment assessments) and three times in Track B (one pre-treatment, two on-treatment assessments).

 If possible, we plan to time assessments to bridge the transition from E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF so that all participants will ideally have one CSF collection on each regimen, enabling a paired comparison of tenofovir concentrations between the two tenofovir formulations.

 We estimate that 28 on-treatment CSF collections will be sufficient to provide a small-sample estimate of the distribution of elvitegravir, tenofovir and TAF into CSF.

The project will have two tracks, one for participants who are currently taking elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF) single-tablet regimen* (STR) (Track A) and one for participants who will begin therapy with E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF STR during the study (Track B).

 Participants will take E/C/F/TDF and/or E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (E/C/F/TAF) STR** (if available) for 24 weeks.

 *Co-formulation of 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

 **Co-formulation of 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.
