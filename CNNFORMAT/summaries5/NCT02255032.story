(thirdQuint)Suprachoroidal Injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide in Subjects With Macular Edema Following Non-Infectious Uveitis.

 This is a Phase 2, randomized, masked, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of two different doses of CLS-TA in the treatment of subjects with macular edema following non-infectious uveitis.

 Each subject will receive a single suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA.

 The subjects enrolled in this study will be chosen from subjects with macular edema following non-infectious uveitis.

 A single injection will be administered via the Clearside microinjector into the suprachoroidal space.

 The dose injected will either be 4 mg or 0.

8 mg of CLS-TA in a total volume of 100 1/2L.
