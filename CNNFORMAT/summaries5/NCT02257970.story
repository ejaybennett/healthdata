(firstQuint)Placebo-controlled Lymphedema Study for Arm or Leg Lymphedema.

 This study compares the effectiveness of a study drug versus placebo in the treatment of lymphedema to the untreated condition, in the same individual.

 This will be accomplished by obtaining four biopsies (small pieces of skin from your arm or leg), before treatment and after treatment.

 We will try to determine how the study drug affects the body tissue.

 Patients who participate in this study will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive either the study drug or a placebo, which is an inactive substance which may resemble an active agent, but has no medical value.

 Every participant will have a 50:50 chance of receiving the study drug.
