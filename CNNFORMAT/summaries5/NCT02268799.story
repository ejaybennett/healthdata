(thirdQuint)High Sensitivity Troponin T Levels Following DC Cardioversion for Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter.

 High sensitivity Troponin T is a relatively new biomarker that is highly sensitive and specific for myocardial injury.

 Its widespread use has helped in the determination and investigation for myocardial ischemia in patients.

 Previous studies have shown a rise in creatine kinase (CK) and the more specific creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CKMB) after DC cardioversion.

 Studies on the earlier generation troponin T found that the levels don't rise or rise only minimally after DC cardioversion.

 The high sensitivity troponin T has never been studied in the setting of DC cardioversion.

 High Sensitivity Troponin T Levels Following DC Cardioversion for Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a rise in serum high sensitivity troponin T (a marker for heart muscle injury) following a direct current cardioversion (shock therapy) used for patients with atrial fibrillation.

 This will help us determine if direct current cardioversion results in damage to the heart muscles in a sufficient amount to cause a rise in high sensitivity troponin T.
