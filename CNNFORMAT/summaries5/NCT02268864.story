(thirdQuint)A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Simeprevir and Daclatasvir in Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1b-Infected Participants.

 This is an open-label (all people know which treatment the participants receive) study to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of simeprevir and daclatasvir in chronic Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infected participants who are treatment-naive.

 The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 40 weeks or approximately 52 weeks.

 The study will consist of 4 parts: Screening Phase (approximately 4 weeks) and open-label treatment Phase (12 weeks), optional open label treatment phase extension (12 Weeks) and follow-up Phase (up to Week 40 or Week 52).

 Participants will receive simeprevir (150 milligram [mg] capsule) and daclatasvir (60 mg tablet) orally once daily for 12 or 24 weeks.

 Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of participants with SVR12.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 12- or 24-week treatment regimen of simeprevir in combination with daclatasvir, as measured by sustain virologic response 12 (SVR12), in treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b-infected participants who have advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (METAVIR F3/F4).
