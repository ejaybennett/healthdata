(secondQuint)Effect of Different Injection Speeds for Spinal Anaesthesia in Caesarean Section.

 We plan to investigate if by varying the speed of injection during spinal anaesthesia, will there be a difference in the incidence of hypotension.

 Hypotension is a common complication especially for pregnant women undergoing caesarean section.

 A high speed of injection can theoretically cause a higher spread of anaesthetic, which may increase the incidence of hypotension.

 We want to know if by prolonging the injection time, will this lead to a reduction in a rate of hypotension.

The purpose of this study is to investigate if prolonging the speed of injection during spinal anaesthesia can reduce the incidence of hypotension and/or medication requirements thereby making it safer for the mother and foetus.
