(secondQuint)Assessing the Safety and Bioactivity of SG1002 in Heart Failure Patients.

 This will be a 3 month, placebo controlled double blind study, to determine whether 800 mg SG1002 given twice daily will be safe and will improve circulating levels of hydrogen sulfide and/or nitrite in heart failure subjects.

 In addition, secondary endpoints such as 6 minute walk distance, Minnesota heart failure questionnaire, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and cardiac remodeling will be assessed.
