(thirdQuint)Mental Health Intervention for Elderly Abuse Victims.

 Despite increasing recognition of the epidemic of elder abuse, we continue to face barriers helping abuse victims access and use elder abuse resolution services.

 In addition, many victims suffer from concurrent mental health problems that prevent them from taking the necessary steps to protect themselves.

 The proposed study will introduce a tailored intervention, built on an evidence-based approach (Problem Solving Therapy), to be delivered through a sustainable mental health program embedded in elder abuse services.

 The proposed psychotherapy is a brief 8-session weekly intervention that combines problem-solving therapy, anxiety management, and psycho education developed specifically for this population by this team.

 The objectives of the project are to: identify the mental health needs of elder abuse victims, provide the mental health treatment, assess the impact of the treatment, and facilitate conditions which will sustain the mental health program.

 Mental Health Intervention for Elderly Abuse Victims@highlight

There is no current elder abuse service that systematically assesses and provides services to address the mental health needs of older adult abuse victims.

 The proposed study will investigate the efficacy of a skill-based, mental health intervention to help treat elder abuse victims, bolster mental health outcomes, and improve detection of symptomatology in future screenings.
