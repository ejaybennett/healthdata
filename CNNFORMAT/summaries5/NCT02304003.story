(thirdQuint)The Effect of an Evidence-based Physiotherapy Regimen for Patients With Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy.

 There has been a fourfold increase in surgery rates for non-traumatic shoulder disorders , despite increasing evidence demonstrating that there is no difference in effect between physiotherapy based- and surgical interventions.

 The target population for this study is patients suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy waiting for subacromial decompression surgery at a university hospital in Norway.

 During this waiting period , study participants will be randomly assigned to standard follow up or a physiotherapy regimen in primary care.

 We want to compare the effect of a structured physiotherapy regimen consisting of heavy slow resistance exercises, stretching, manual mobilization and low level laser therapy to standard follow up.

 The Effect of an Evidence-based Physiotherapy Regimen for Patients With Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy@highlight

Primary aim of this study is to investigate wether an evidence-based physiotherapy regimen is more effective than standard care in patients referred for arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder.

 It is hypothesized that a multimodal physiotherapy regimen will relieve pain, improve shoulder function and reduce the need for subacromial decompression surgery of the shoulder compared to standard care/wait and see controls.
