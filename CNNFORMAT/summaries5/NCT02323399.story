(fifthQuint)Study to Determine the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Effects of Phenylephrine on BP Via IV.

 This is a Phase 4 multi-center, randomized open-label study in 100 subjects aged 12 to 16 years who experience a decrease in blood pressure during a procedure requiring general or neuraxial anesthesia.

 At least 300 subjects will be enrolled in this study.

 It is anticipated that up to 33% of enrolled subjects will actually experience a decrease in blood pressure that requires treatment and so will receive Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection (PHI).

 There are 12 possible randomization assignments: one of six initial treatments PHI will be initially administered to approximately 50 subjects as an intravenous bolus (IV-B) at Low (1 1/2g/kg), Med (3 1/2g/kg), or High (5 1/2g/kg) level; PHI will be initially administered to approximately 50 subjects as a continuous intravenous infusion (IV-I) at Low (0.

25 1/2g/kg/min), Med (0.

75 1/2g/kg/min), or High (1.

25 1/2g/kg/min) level]; each initial treatment group will have two pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling schedules.

 Study to Determine the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Effects of Phenylephrine on BP Via IV@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose effect of Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection on the treatment of clinically relevant decreased blood pressure in the pediatric population, 12 to 16 year old patients undergoing general and neuraxial anesthesia.

 The secondary objectives are to describe changes in blood pressure and heart rate, time to onset and to maximal response, and the duration of response; to assess the safety of the product in this population; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of phenylephrine hydrochloride.
