(secondQuint)Effect of Miglustat on the Nasal Potential Difference in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for the F508del Mutation.

 The aims of this study are: 1.

 To determine whether Miglustat can restore the function of the CFTR protein in adult patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation 2.

 To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Miglustat in adult patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.

 3.

 To investigate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic of Miglustat in adult patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.
