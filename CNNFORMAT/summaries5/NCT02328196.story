(fifthQuint)Validation of a Revised Version of the Danish McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment.

 This study will assess the construct validity of a revised version of MISA-DK in the acute and rehabilitative settings by testing it for fit against a multidimensional Rasch model.

 Participants in this research will be 500 dysphagic clients from several centres in Denmark, namely 250 acute patients from three Danish Regional university Hospitals in Herning, Hjorring and Odense, and 250 clients in the rehabilitation setting from the Arhus Rehabilitation Institute, Hillerod Rehabilitation Institute and the Rehabilitation division of Copenhagen.

 Participants who are judged to have a swallowing problem are assessed with the MISA-DK by special educated occupational therapists The MISA-DK assessment are implemented as a part of the usual assessment routine at the occupational therapy departments at the included centres and will be administered immediately after referral to Occupational therapy.

 This research will be the first to implement and assess a standardised method for assessing mealtime performance for dysphagia in dysphagic patients across the continuum of diagnosis and rehabilitation recovery.

 The application of the Multidimensional Rasch models to the MIS-DK data aims to identify the combination of items in the MISA-DK that provide the highest level of specific objectivity and statistical sufficiency when determining ingestive skill ability.

 Furthermore, Differential item function by diagnosis, age and setting will be determined.

 Validation of a Revised Version of the Danish McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment@highlight

The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment (MISA) for measuring dysphagic clients' functional performance during meals has been previously translated into Danish (MISA-DK) and this translated version validated.

 Critical issues about the construct validity of the scale, per se, had been raised.

 Consequently, major revisions of the MISA-DK have been undertaken, which necessitates a new validation process.

 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the construct validity of a revised version of the MISA-DK when used amongst dysphagic adults in hospitals settings and community services.
