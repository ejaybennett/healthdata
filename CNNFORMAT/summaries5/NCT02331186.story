(secondQuint)Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Pelvic Floor Fonctions in Obese Women.

 Obesity is considered an important public health problem, both in developed and developing countries.

 Obese people are at a higher risk for developing various comorbidities: type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, coagulation disorders, degenerative joint disease, some types of cancer, sleep apnea and urinary incontinence Women suffering from obesity are more likely to develop urinary incontinence, especially when related to stress.

 Excess weight is a modifiable risk factor.

 It is believed that weight reduction may be an effective treatment for urinary incontinence.

 The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery on pelvic floor function.

 Taking into account that modest weight loss (5% to 10%) already brings benefits to women with obesity and incontinence, one may assume even more marked improvement owing to the massive loss of weight by surgical means.
