(thirdQuint)Internet-delivered CBT for NCCP-patients - a Pilot Trial.

 Despite reassurance, many patients with non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) think they have an undetected cardiac disease and avoid activities that they think might be harmful to their heart.

 These patients need help and support to evaluate the way they perceive and handle their chest pain.

 Therefore, we have developed a 4 session guided intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy that will be delivered via internet.

 The intervention consists of psychoeducation, exposure to physical activity, and a breathing-based relaxation exercise.

 The goal with the intervention is to help the participants modify their beliefs about chest pain, change their cognitive and behavioural strategies, and give them tools to handle chest pain to prevent them from relapse.

 Internet-delivered CBT for NCCP-patients - a Pilot Trial@highlight

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy intervention in the treatment of cardiac anxiety and fear of body sensations in patients with non-cardiac chest pain.

 The control group will receive care-as-usual.
