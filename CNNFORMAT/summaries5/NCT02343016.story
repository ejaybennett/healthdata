(secondQuint)NIRS as a Continuous Noninvasive Monitoring System of Liver/Kidney Graft Perfusion.

 This is an observational descriptive pilot study to explore the Somanetics INVOS(R) system performance.

 In this study the investigators will recruit a convenient number of patients, 15 patients, that will be admitted to our ICU after liver/kidney transplantation, in a 6 month period.

 The Primary endpoint will be the correlation between hepatic/renal NIRS measurements and graft's artery resistance indices, as evaluated with ecodoppler.

 The Secondary endpoints will be: - The Correlation between NIRS measurements and biochemical indicators of graft function (NGAL for kidney transplantation and INR, SGOT/SGPT, bilirubin, lactate for liver transplantation) - The Correlation between NIRS measurements and SvO2 values.

The aim of the investigators work is to describe the agreement between NIRS and ecodoppler, as monitoring systems of liver and kidney graft's perfusion in the immediate postoperative period in pediatric patients.
