(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety Trial of 12 Weeks of Treatment With Nebulized SUN-101 in Patients With COPD.

 This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, efficacy and safety trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an Investigational eFlow(R) Closed System (CS) nebulizer in approximately 645 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014) guidelines.

 SUN-101 or placebo will be administered twice daily as an oral inhalation using the investigational eFlow CS nebulizer.

 Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the substudy (at selected sites only).

 These subjects will be required to participate in serial spirometry, vital signs, ECGs, and an additional Holter monitor assessment at Visit 6 (Week 12).

 This subset of subjects will be referred to as the Substudy Population.
