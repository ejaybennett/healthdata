(thirdQuint)Lifestyle Intervention for Senior Diabetics.

 Background: Hypothesis: Lifestyle intervention will be highly successful in the population of older adults with diabetes, with resultant significant improvement in glycemic metabolic control mediated by improved insulin action/secretion, accompanied by significant improvements in physical function, cognitive function, and quality-of-life (QOL).

 Rationale: Countering the prevailing notion that it is difficult to change lifelong habits, the PI has ample preliminary data showing successful lifestyle change in older adults.

 A similar lifestyle intervention augmented by motivational interviewing might also be successful in older adults with diabetes with eventual translation to the community- and home-settings.

 Aims: In older adults with diabetes and comorbidities, the aims are to: determine the effect of lifestyle intervention on glycemic metabolic control, determine the mechanisms underlying lifestyle-induced changes in glucose homeostasis, and determine the effect of lifestyle intervention on age-relevant health outcomes: physical function, cognitive function, QOL.

 Design: Older adults with diabetes and comorbidities will be randomized to center-based lifestyle intervention continued into the community and home vs.

 healthy-lifestyle control for 1 year.

 Relevance to diabetes prevention and treatment: Data from a randomized-controlled trial will provide high-level evidence to convince practitioners to implement lifestyle intervention as the primary therapy for diabetes in older patients.

 Lifestyle Intervention for Senior Diabetics@highlight

Older people with diabetes will be assigned to the 1-year lifestyle program or no lifestyle program while continuing usual treatment for diabetes.

 The lifestyle program will consist of teaching how to practice healthy diet and regular exercise at our facility and continued into the community and home.

 It is hoped that the results would provide convincing proof about the usefulness of lifestyle change in older patients with diabetes.
