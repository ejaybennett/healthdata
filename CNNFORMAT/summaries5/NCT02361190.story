(secondQuint)Effects of Fast Acting Testosterone Nasal Spray on Anxiety.

 Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that men administered testosterone nasal spray will result in lower levels of anxiety (anticipatory and situational) and greater levels of approach behavior in response to two distinct (social and nonsocial) anxiety challenges relative to men administered placebo spray.

 Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that anxiety challenge type (social versus nonsocial) will moderate the effects of testosterone administration on subjects' responses to challenge.

 Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that rejection sensitivity - heightened sensitivity to evaluative threat - will moderate the effects of drug condition on response to the two anxiety challenge tests.
