(thirdQuint)Botulinum Toxin Injection Versus Anal Myectomy in Management of Idiopathic Constipation.

 Functional constipation (chronic idiopathic constipation) is most common cause of constipation in pediatric age group.

 Many cases try conservative treatment but fail to respond.

 These cases are treated by surgical longitudinal myectomy of the anal sphincter.

 Now, there have been many trials of trying injection of botulinum toxin to relax the sphincter as a treatment of functional/idiopathic constipation.

 In this study, the investigators will compare the results of botulinum toxin injection versus surgical myectomy to treat functional/idiopathic constipation in children.
