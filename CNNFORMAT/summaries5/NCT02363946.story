(thirdQuint)A Study of ARC-AAT in Healthy Volunteer Subjects and Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD).

 This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose-escalation first-in-human, Phase 1 study.

 Healthy volunteers and AATD patients will be randomized to receive a single intravenous injection of either ARC-AAT or Placebo in double-blind fashion.

 Up to thirteen cohorts (6 participants per cohort) will be enrolled.

 Subjects in all cohorts will be confined to the clinical facility beginning on Day -1 with discharge on Day 2.

 Escalation to the next dose level will proceed until a participant experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or there is achievement of pre-determined threshold reductions in AAT levels.

 Dosing in AATD patients will commence based on pre-determined threshold reductions in AAT levels for healthy volunteers.

 Participants will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals: medical history, physical examinations, bee venom allergy blood test, vital sign measurements, weight, adverse event monitoring, ECGs, pregnancy test (females), concurrent medication, pulmonary function testing and sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, pharmacokinetics (PK), complement, cytokines, drug screens, serum alpha-1antitrypsin levels, and urinalysis.

 For each participant, the duration of the study clinic visits is up to 11 weeks, from Screening to the End-of-Study examination.

 However, including a Day 90 Follow-Up telephone call, the maximum study duration is approximately 20 weeks.

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ARC-AAT and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ARC-AAT and the effect of ARC-AAT on circulating levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin.

 The study will consist of two parts, Part A (conducted in healthy volunteers) and Part B (conducted in AATD patients) at up to 9 escalating dose levels with 6 participants per dose level.
