(fifthQuint)Efficacy of Injected Local Anesthetic vs Topical Anesthetic in Cosmetic Injectable Fillers.

.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if local anesthesia injections will provide more profound analgesia than topical anesthesia during facial cosmetic filler injections.

 The study is a randomized controlled trial.

 The attending surgeon or residents will perform the procedure.

 Each procedure will start with a randomized coin flip to determine which side of the face will be anesthetized with local anesthesia or topical anesthesia.

 The head side of the coin will coincide with local anesthesia on the patient's right side.

 The tail of the coin will designate the patient's left side for local anesthetic injections.

 To evaluate whether the additional anesthesia of a nerve block brings more pain relief than the initial pain of receiving a nerve block, the pain value will be collected from each nerve block administered.

 Procedural injection pain data will be collected from the nerve blocked facial half and from the topical anesthetic facial half to provide a comparison of anesthesia during the procedure.

 The primary outcome will be the collection of "overall" pain data from each side of the face 5-10 minutes after the procedure.

 Facial anesthesia preference data will also be collected at one week post-op to determine overall pain perceptions from each method of facial anesthesia.

 Efficacy of Injected Local Anesthetic vs Topical Anesthetic in Cosmetic Injectable Fillers.

@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare two modalities of local anesthetic administration prior to the placement of cosmetic facial injectable fillers.

 Both short and long term pain perceptions for the facial filler procedure will be compared in patients receiving 4% Topicaine gel on half their face and 2% lidocaine 1:100k epinephrine nerve block injections on the other half of their face.

 The objective is to quantify the subjective pain experienced by these two modalities of local anesthetic during the procedure of Juvederm XC filler injections.
