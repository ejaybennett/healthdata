(thirdQuint)Improving Resilience With Whole Grain Wheat.

 The study is a randomized controlled, double blind, parallel trial.

 A 4-week run-in period with refined wheat (RW) products will be included prior to the intervention for all subjects.

 Thereafter, two different treatments will be evaluated e.

g.

 a 12-week intervention with whole grain wheat (WGW) products (98g of WGW per day) and a 12-week control intervention with RW products.

 Two experimental visits will be planned before and two experimental visits will be planned after the 12-week intervention period.

 In the first experimental visit the investigators will determine liver fat and abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 In the second experimental visit the investigators will comprehensively phenotype the participants which will include the response to a mixed meal challenge test.

 Improving Resilience With Whole Grain Wheat@highlight

This study investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat on cardiovascular/ cardio-metabolic health, including glucose metabolism, by means of applying a mixed meal challenge.

 This study also investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat (WGW) on liver- and adipose tissue health and evaluates the potential of do-it-yourself (DIY) devices in quantifying health effects in a nutritional intervention study.
