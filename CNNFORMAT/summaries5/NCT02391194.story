(firstQuint)Trial of AVB-620 in Women With Primary, Non-Recurrent Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery.

 This study will examine the safety and tolerability of AVB-620 administered as an IV infusion to women with primary, non-recurrent breast cancer undergoing surgery.

 The study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics of AVB-620 in this subject population and determine the dose of AVB-620 needed to generate a fluorescence signal in tumor and lymph node tissue to enable fluorescence recordings and image analysis with an imaging system.

 The study will also evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration, relative to surgery, on fluorescence characteristics.
