(thirdQuint)Whole Blood Bactericidal Activity (WBA) Against Mycobacterium Tuberculosis of Faropenem Plus Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid in Healthy Volunteers.

 WBA is an ex vivo model for measuring the combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial killing.

 If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle.

 The aim of this trial is to investigate the bactericidal activity of faropenem administered with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (augmentin) using the WBA model.

 We will also explore whether there is any additive effect or synergy with rifampicin in this model.

 The activity of faropenem on WBA by different strains of M.

 tuberculosis will be compared and the relationship between the host immune profile and WBA will be assessed.

 Whole Blood Bactericidal Activity (WBA) Against Mycobacterium Tuberculosis of Faropenem Plus Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis of faropenem boosted with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

 Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Whole blood Bactericidal Activity (WBA) will be measured in healthy volunteers following single doses of faropenem plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
