(thirdQuint)Medtronic Reveal LINQ In-Office 2 (RIO 2) Study United States.

 RIO 2 is a two arm, randomized, prospective, un-blinded, multicenter, non-significant risk study.

 The primary objective for RIO 2 will be assessed by randomizing subjects to receive their LINQ cent insertion in the office setting or in the traditional hospital environment.

 Moving the LINQ cent insertion procedure to the office setting is not expected to decrease the complication rate compared to in hospital insertion procedures, however, moving the LINQ cent insertion procedure out of the traditional hospital setting may benefit the patient and reduce the burden to the healthcare system.

The primary purpose of the RIO 2 study is to demonstrate that when the Reveal LINQ cent insertable cardiac monitoring (ICM) system that records subcutaneous ECG insertion procedure performed in the in-office setting is as safe as LINQ cent insertions performed in the traditional hospital setting (operating room, cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology (EP) laboratory).
