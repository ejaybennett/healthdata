(fifthQuint)Effect of Momordica Charantia Administration on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Secretion.

 A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial is carried out in 24 patients with diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association.

 Patients are assigned to two different arms: one group receives Momordica Charantia, 2 capsules with 500 mg twice daily before breakfast and dinner for 90 days or placebo, under the same scheme of treatment.

 An oral glucose tolerance test is performed before and after the intervention.

 Matsuda index, Stumvoll index and Insulinogenic index are calculated to assess insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

 Other clinical and laboratory parameters that are evaluated include: Body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, body fat percentage, fasting plasma glucose, A1C, creatinine, lipid profile and liver transaminases.

 Effect of Momordica Charantia Administration on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Secretion@highlight

The hypoglycemic effect of Momordica Charantia has been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Important reductions in fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), and fructosamine were observed.

 It is unknown whether this improvement is due to an improvement in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the administration of Momordica Charantia on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
