(fifthQuint)Anesthesia And Post-operative Mortality After Proximal Femur Fractures.

 Proximal femur fracture is one of the most common causes of admission in emergency departments.

 Mortality is high among these patients and is reported to range from 10% at 30 days, up to 32% at one-year post-operative.

 Several strategies to reduce mortality have been used, but mortality rate has plateaued since 1998.

 Attempts to show benefit from regional or general anesthesia have shown inconsistent results.

 New techniques with peripheral nerve blocks have been used, but their effect on mortality when used as major anesthesia component have not been studied.

 The investigators hypothesise that smaller physiologic impact of peripheral nerve blocks associated to light general anesthesia may improve survival rates and reduce short term delirium after proximal femur fracture surgery.

 Recovery of quality of life will also be assessed.

 Patients will be randomized into two groups, being allocated for a subarachnoid anesthesia or a combination of peripheral nerve blocks and light general anesthesia.

 Patients will be followed up for short-term post-operative complications such as incidence of delirium, recovery of quality of life and survival up to one year.

 Anesthesia And Post-operative Mortality After Proximal Femur Fractures@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of anesthesia on mortality after surgical repair of proximal femur fracture.

 Patients will receive either a subarachnoid block or a combination of peripheral nerve blocks and light general anesthesia (PNB/GA).

 The investigators hypothesis is that a combination of peripheral nerve blocks with an opioid free light anesthesia may have more favourable outcomes.

 Both groups will be followed up for assessment of post-operative morbidity and mortality.
