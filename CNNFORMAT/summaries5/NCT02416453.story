(firstQuint)A Study to Assess Safety Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Three Prime-boost Regimens of the Candidate Prophylactic Vaccines for Ebola in Healthy Adults.

 This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase 2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 heterologous prime-boost regimens using Ad26.

ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered to healthy adults participants in Europe.

 The study consists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1), followed by a boost vaccination on Days 29, 57 or 85, and a post-vaccination phase until 6 month post-boost visit (Days 209, 237 or 265).

 After unblinding, only participants who received Ad26.

ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo will continue the study until the Day 365 (or until the start of the roll-over study or for an additional 12 months [whichever comes first] for participants in France who agree to continue the long-term follow-up after Day 365) visit to assess long-term safety and immunogenicity.

 Participants will enroll into 3 cohorts: that is, Cohort 1(Participants will receive Ad26.

ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in an open-label fashion), Cohort 2 (Participants will be randomized to receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.

ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 14:1 ratio) and Cohort 3 (Participants will be randomized to receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.

ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 10:3 ratio).

 In Cohorts 2 and 3, core immunogenicity assessments (humoral and cellular assays) will be performed.

 In Cohort 2, additional immunogenicity assessments will be done.

 In Cohort 1, plasma blast response kinetics will be evaluated.

 Safety will be monitored during the study.

 A Study to Assess Safety Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Three Prime-boost Regimens of the Candidate Prophylactic Vaccines for Ebola in Healthy Adults@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 vaccination schedules of Ad26.

ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered intramuscularly (IM) as heterologous prime-boost regimens.
