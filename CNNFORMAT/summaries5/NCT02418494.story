(thirdQuint)Health-Related Symptom Questionnaires in Measuring Quality of Life in HIV-Infected Participants Treated or Monitored for Anal Lesions.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To develop an Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research Study (ANCHOR) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Index (HQI) using state-of-the-art measure development methodology that captures the most important HRQoL symptoms and concerns of those persons diagnosed with anal HSIL and either treated or untreated for anal HSIL.

 OUTLINE: Participants complete the ANCHOR HSIL HRQoL interview over 45-60 minutes, comparing the list of symptoms, concerns, or HRQOL impacts related to HSIL diagnosis and treatment.

 Some patients also complete a cognitive interview for up to 3 sessions.

 Health-Related Symptom Questionnaires in Measuring Quality of Life in HIV-Infected Participants Treated or Monitored for Anal Lesions@highlight

This research trial studies health-related symptom questionnaires in measuring quality of life in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants treated with or monitored for anal lesions.

 Collecting information and symptoms from patients diagnosed with anal lesions may help reduce the risk of anal cancer.
