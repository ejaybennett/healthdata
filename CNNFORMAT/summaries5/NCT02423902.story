(thirdQuint)A Study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 With Veledimex in Subjects With Breast Cancer.

 Subjects who have PD or a CR after the standard chemotherapy are not eligible for the study.

 Following entry into the trial, patients will go on a treatment holiday from chemotherapy and enter an immunotherapy phase of treatment.

 Continuation of HER2-targeted antibody therapy is permitted during this immunotherapy phase for women with HER2+ disease.

 Scans will be conducted at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy to determine tumor response.

 Radiographic PD at week 6 must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later, either at week 12 or earlier if clinically necessitated.
