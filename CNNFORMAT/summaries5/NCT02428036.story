(secondQuint)A Study of TBI-1401(HF10) in Patients With Solid Tumors With Superficial Lesions.

 This is an open label, non-randomized, dose escalation Phase I study evaluating the repeated intratumoral administrations of the TBI-1401(HF10), a spontaneously attenuated mutant of HSV-1, in patients with solid tumors with superficial lesions (e.

g.

, malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).

 The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral administrations of TBI-1401(HF10) at dose levels of 1 x 10^6 TCID50/dose (cohort 1) and 1 x 10^7 TCID50/dose (cohort 2) in Japanese patients.

 Three patients will be enrolled in each cohort.

 Patients in the each cohort will receive a total of four intratumoral administrations in the same lesion.
