(thirdQuint)Scalp Nerve Block on Emergence Agitation.

 Forty-four children, 1-7 years old, undergoing nevus surgery on head were enrolled.

 Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium and rocuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane.

 Patients were randomly assigned two groups: the control group received IV remifentanil 1 1/2g/kg, and the block group received scalp nerve block with 0.

25% ropivacaine 2-3 ml.

 Time to tracheal extubation, recovery time, hemodynamic change, FLACC score, and Watcha behavior scale for emergence agitation were assessed.

 Scalp Nerve Block on Emergence Agitation@highlight

Emergence agitation is a common problem in children during recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia.

 Pain is considered as a cause of postoperative emergence agitation and compounding factor of agitation assessment in children.

 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of scalp nerve block on the emergence agitation in children undergoing nevus surgery during sevoflurane anesthesia.
