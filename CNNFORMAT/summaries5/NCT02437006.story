(fifthQuint)Early Intervention With a Low-intensity Leg Cycling Exercise Program for Individuals After Stroke.

 This is a two-stage study.

 In the first stage, 30 subjects with stroke (onset > 2 weeks) are recruited, and they are assessed and recorded with sympathetic nerve testing, anthropometry, and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests.

The second stage would recruited 90 subjects with stroke (onset>2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups.

 The control group undergoes traditional rehabilitation only, The low-intensity exercise group receives a low-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation.

 The The high-intensity exercise group gets a high-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation.

 They are evaluated by sympathetic tests, anthropometry, functional scales and activity questionnaires, and symptom-limit exercise capacity tests before and after the four-week training.

 The second stage would recruited 90 subjects with stroke (onset>2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups (control, low-intensity, high-intensity).
