(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety of Neural Stem Cells in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.

 ISC-hpNSC is a cellular therapeutic consisting of human parthenogenetic neural stem cells (hpNSC).

 ISC-hpNSC will be injected intracerebrally to the striatum and substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The study will enroll 4 patients for cell injection at each of three different doses.

 A total of 12 patients with moderate to severe PD will be treated.

 Each patient receives a single dose.

 The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the cell transplantation.
