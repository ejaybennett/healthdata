(thirdQuint)Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics Study of Existing DMPA Contraceptive Methods.

 This is a randomized, multi-center, parallel-group Phase I study with a primary objective to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL Depo-Provera CI in the abdomen of women of reproductive age with a confirmed ovulatory baseline cycle.

 Secondary study objectives are: - To evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MPA after a single SC injection of 150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL of Depo-Provera CI to two injections of Depo-subQ 104 administered 3 months apart - To evaluate the relationship between serum MPA concentration and suppression of ovulation - To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability and acceptability of a SC injection of DMPA of different frequencies, doses and volumes.
