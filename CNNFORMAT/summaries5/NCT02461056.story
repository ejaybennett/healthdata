(thirdQuint)Synergistic Effect of Ibuprofen and Hydromorphone for Postoperative Pain.

 Ninety patients, undergoing breast surgery, were included in one of the three groups (Ibuprofen, Hydromorphone, Ibuprofen+Hydromorphone groups).

 Positive analgesic efficacy was defined as a numeric rating scale (NRS) 3 on a 0-10 NRS, 30 min after the drug administration.

 Drug was administered by the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method.

 Starting doses were ibuprofen 50 mg, hydromorphone 0.

25 mg, or ibuprofen 25 mg + hydromorphone 0.

125 mg.

 The maximum doses were ibuprofen 800 mg, hydromorphone 2 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg + hydromorphone 1 mg.
