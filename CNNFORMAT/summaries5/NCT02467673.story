(secondQuint)Nanoparticulate Versus Micronized Steroids Delivery for Transdermal Hormone Replacement Therapy.

 In this open label study, 27 postmenopausal women, with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease, were randomly divided in two groups.

 During 12 weeks, 15 patients received on the left forearm micronized (MIC) THT (micronized 17-estradiol 2.

5 mg/day + progesterone 100 mg/day).

 and 14 patients received a nanoparticulate (NANO) THT (nanoparticulate 17-estradiol 2.

5 mg/day + progesterone 100mg/day).

 After 12 weeks of treatment patients were evaluated.

 Baseline and Post-THT measures were determined: Insulin, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, CRP-stratified levels, total testosterone, TSH and FSH levels.

The study aims to asses the effects of micronized (MIC) and nanoparticulate (NANO) transdermal hormone therapy (THT) on blood pressure, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women.
