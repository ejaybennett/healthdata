(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of SC0806 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1 and a Device) in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Subjects.

 The study is a single dose study in up to 3 sequences in subjects with complete Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.

 In each sequence, 6 subjects will be randomized to a surgical procedure where SC0806 will be implanted into the spinal cord and receive specific walking training, and 3 subjects will be randomized to specific walking training only.

 Interim analyses of safety parameters will be performed.

 If a positive effect and no major safety concerns have been demonstrated after completion of all sequences, the control subjects will be given the opportunity to receive treatment with SC0806 after completion of their rehabilitation periods.
