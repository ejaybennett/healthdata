(secondQuint)Studying Physiological and Anatomical Cerebral Effects of Carbon Dioxide and Tilt.

 Many of the long duration astronauts develop visual changes, associated with neuroophthalmological abnormalities suggesting elevated intracranial pressure.

 There is currently no suitable ground based analog to simulate these changes on Earth, or a standard methodological approach to monitoring the combined effects of head down tilt and atmospheric carbon dioxide.

 Given that carbon dioxide and cephalad fluid shifting are known factors in spaceflight, we sought to evaluate an approach to monitoring these effects in healthy subject in a ground based analog on Earth.

 Studying Physiological and Anatomical Cerebral Effects of Carbon Dioxide and Tilt@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study the effects of carbon dioxide combined with head down tilt on cerebral physiology and anatomy.

 This paradigm will help establish a ground-based analog for spaceflight, and also evaluate the ability of non-invasive devices to monitor brain physiology.
