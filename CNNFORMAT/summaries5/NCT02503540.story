(fifthQuint)Peripheral and Macular Retinal Vascular Perfusion and Leakage in DME and RVO.

 Diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema secondary to retinal venous occlusive diseases are the most common cause of vision loss from a retinal vascular disease.

 Recently VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab) have been described as new first-line therapies for these conditions.

 Aflibercept is the most recently approved VEGF inhibitor for the management of these conditions.

 Clinical trials have shown that treatment with aflibercept improves visual acuity and reduces macular edema in a large percentage of patients.

 This study will examine the changes that occur with intravitreal aflibercept to perfusion and leakage in treatment naive eyes over the course of 1 year.

This interventional study will evaluate the retinal vascular dynamics associated with Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) therapy in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) or macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

 Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography will be performed at multiple timepoints to assess the changes in retinal vascular leakage, ischemia, and vascular abnormalities throughout the study duration and compare these alterations to baseline.
