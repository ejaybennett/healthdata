(thirdQuint)TCR+/CD19+ Depleted Haploidentical HSCT + Zoledronate.

 REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) intravenously (IV) on days -12 to -9, fludarabine phosphate IV on days -8 to -5, thiotepa IV twice daily (BID) on day -4, and melphalan IV on days -3 to -2.

 PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TCR-+ and CD19+ depleted haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

 ZOLEDRONATE ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive zoledronate IV after transplant as determined by their assigned treatment group (Cohort).

 Patients in Cohort A do not receive zoledronate.

 Follow-up assessments will occur after transplantation.

 TCR+/CD19+ Depleted Haploidentical HSCT + Zoledronate@highlight

This phase I trial studies the safety of transplantation with a haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell graft depleted of TCR+ cells and CD19+ cells in conjunction with the immunomodulating drug, Zoledronate, given in the post-transplant period to treat pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies or high risk solid tumors.
