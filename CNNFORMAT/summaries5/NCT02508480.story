(fifthQuint)Testing Effectiveness of a Peer-Led Intervention to Enhance Community Integration.

 We are conducting a RCT comparing the 10-week peer-led Photovoice program to services as usual (SAU) enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led group discussion session.

 The RCT will be at a large publicly funded community mental health agency in Massachusetts.

 A total of 192 participants or 96 participants per group will be recruited over a period of 36 months across the three clubhouses of the agency where the intervention will take place.

 We plan to have randomization cohorts of 16 individuals per delivery of the Photovoice program at each of the three clubhouses.

 Given the projected sample size of 192 participants, we will have 12 randomization cohorts - 4 at each clubhouse implemented at 6-month intervals.

 Participants will be randomized to either the Photovoice program (plus usual services) or the enhanced SAU.

 Participants will be assessed by a blinded rater at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups on a range of primary and secondary outcomes related to personal stigma, coping, and functioning.

 Primary analyses will test the hypotheses that the Photovoice program will lead to significantly greater reductions in self-stigma and perceived stigma, greater improvements in proactive coping with psychiatric prejudice and discrimination, and greater improvements in community functioning and integration than the enhanced SAU.

 Secondary analyses will evaluate whether the Photovoice program leads to greater gains than SAU in psychological adjustment, including wellbeing, personal growth and recovery.

 Individuals randomized to the enhanced SAU will be able to join the 10-week Photovoice program once they complete their 6-month follow up for the study.

 Testing Effectiveness of a Peer-Led Intervention to Enhance Community Integration@highlight

We are conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the 10-week peer-led Photovoice program to services as usual (SAU) at a large publicly funded community mental health agency in Massachusetts.

 The control SAU condition will be enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led group educational session about understanding and coping with prejudice and discrimination.

 The 10-session, peer-led Photovoice program, designed to empower individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) to confront public prejudice and discrimination and reduce personal stigma (self-stigma and perceived stigma), was developed and pilot tested at our Center, with primary contributions from staff with a lived experience of mental illness.

 Development of the Photovoice program was guided by an adaptation of the stress-coping model, informed by recent research and conceptualizations of the effects of stigma on people with SMI.

 The stress-coping model explicates the mechanisms by which public stigma about mental illness can lead to personal stigma, which in turn has a negative impact on the person's mental health and psychosocial functioning.

 This model also identifies critical factors that contribute to personal stigma or protect against it, as well as more vs.

 less adaptive coping responses, that are the primary focus of the Photovoice program.
