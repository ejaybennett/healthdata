(fifthQuint)Combination Chemoembolization and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third ranked cause of global cancer mortality.

 There is an increasing incidence of HCC in the United States over the last twenty years, largely due to the Hepatitis C epidemic but increasingly related as well to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

 This is a non-randomized pilot study to assess the objective response rate and durability of response of combination Trans-Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with immediate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 Eligible patients will be selected based on having a lesion greater than 3 cm which would make them ineligible for other local therapies such as TACE and thermal ablation (TA).

 Eligible, consented, and registered patients will be treated with two sessions of standard TACE with ethiodol separated by a 4-week interval.

 After ensuring adequate return to baseline liver function, the patients will then be treated with SBRT to the targeted lesion to 30-45 Gy in 5 fractions.

 Tumor response will be assessed using mRECIST criteria as well diffusion weight imaging (DWI) via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) surveillance.

 In addition, tolerability and toxicity will be recorded via CTCAE v.

 The essential hypothesis of this study is that combination TACE and SBRT for > 3 cm HCC will produce higher response rates and durable control compared to TACE alone.

 Combination Chemoembolization and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to develop better ways to treat liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC, while it is still in the liver.

 Many treatments exist to treat tumors in the liver when they are small but after they grow past a certain size, local therapies such as surgery, Trans-Arterial Chemo Embolization (TACE), or Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) are not effective.

 The purpose of this study to test the combination of two known treatments - TACE and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) - to be used together to treat larger or difficult to access liver tumors.

 Each treatment has been shown to work well but has limitations.

 The study will combine the treatments in an organized sequence and monitor closely how effective this combination controls tumors.
