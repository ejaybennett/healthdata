(thirdQuint)A Study of Daratumumab With the Addition of Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) for the Treatment of Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, 2-part, Phase 1b dose escalation/expansion study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), and antitumor activity of SC delivery of daratumumab to participant with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

 Up to approximately 53 participants in part 1 and 80 participants in part 2 will be enrolled.

 The purpose of Part 1 is to select an appropriate SC therapeutic dose for the mixture of daratumumab with rHuPH20 based on safety and pharmacokinetics.

 This dose, selected from part 1 will be the initial dose for the co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation to be evaluated in Part 2.

 The purpose of Part 2 is to evaluate the SC delivery of CF and confirm the dose level selected from Part 1 based on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity.

 Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety from the mixture of daratumumab and rHuPH20 prepared immediately before administration via Subcutaneous (SC) delivery (Part 1) and CF (co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation) administration via SC delivery of daratumumab (Part 2).
