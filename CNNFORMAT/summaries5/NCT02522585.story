(secondQuint)p16 and Ki-67 Stainings and Natural Killer (NK) Cells in CIN-II Management.

 Cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), represents a significant public health problem,induced by persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV).

 It is known that a significant percentage of CIN regresses spontaneously and only a minority of these lesions progress to cervical cancer.

 CIN-II is an intermediate state that can regress to CIN-I or less, or progress to CIN-III spontaneously.

 The rate of spontaneous regression and progression in follow-up studies are around 40-60% and 10-20%, respectively.

 Overestimating CIN-II lesions may cause overtreatment by excisional treatment and increase the risk of subsequent obstetric complications.

 Patients newly diagnosed with CIN-II colposcopy-directed biopsy who agreed to follow up at four months intervals for at least 12 months with cervical cytology and colposcopy, were prospectively recruited.

 p16, ki-67 and NK receptors expression were analyzed in all CIN-II biopsies.

 Total regression, partial regression, persistence and progression rates of CIN-II were defined as a final outcome.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN-II) patients followed up without treatment for 24 months according to p16 and ki-67 immunohistochemical staining and to the expression of NK cell receptors.
