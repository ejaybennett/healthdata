(fifthQuint)Phase 3 Study of Efficacy and Safety of the XaraColl Bupivacaine Implant After Hernioplasty.

 This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in adults who are scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy (tension-free technique).

 Patients will receive either 3 XaraColl Bupivacaine Implants each containing 100 mg of bupivacaine hydrochloride, for a 300 mg total dose; or 3 placebo-sponges.

 Three test article sponges will be implanted according to the patient's blinded treatment assignment.

 Following surgery, patients will be transferred to a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and/or other postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive parenteral morphine as needed (rescue medication for breakthrough pain) and on request for pain control.

 Once patients can tolerate oral medication, they will commence a standardized oral analgesic regimen with additional PRN medication to manage breakthrough pain only when it occurs.

 Patients will assess their postoperative pain intensity (PI) using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 hour through 72 hours postoperatively.

 Patients will be observed postoperatively for a minimum of 3 hours and may be discharged at any time following completion of their 3-hour vital sign and PI assessments.

 Patients will be contacted at approximately 6, 24 and 48 hours after implantation to ensure protocol compliance and to perform safety assessments (including AEs and concomitant medications).

 At 72 hours, patients will return to the clinic to perform their final PI assessment, complete a categorical assessment of their overall pain control, and for follow-up safety assessments.

 They will also be asked to record the incidence of any ongoing or subsequent AEs (and any associated treatment) through Day 7.

 Additional follow-up assessments for safety will be performed at postoperative Day 7 (telephone call) and Days 15 and 30 (clinic visits).

 Phase 3 Study of Efficacy and Safety of the XaraColl Bupivacaine Implant After Hernioplasty@highlight

This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of postoperative pain in adults who are scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy (tension-free technique).

 Patients will assess their postoperative pain intensity (PI) using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 hour through 72 hours postoperatively.

 The expected maximum study duration for each patient will be up to 60 days, including a maximum 30-day screening period, the day of surgery and implantation, and a 30-day post implantation period including treatment and follow-up.
