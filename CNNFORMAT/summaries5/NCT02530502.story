(fifthQuint)Radiation Therapy With Temozolomide and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation therapy (RT) + temozolomide (TMZ) + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks), MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months.

 (Phase I) II.

 To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with RT + TMZ + MK-3475 followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks), MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months.

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine PFS-6 (percentage of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months post registration); response rate; overall survival (OS); OS-6, 12 and 24 (percentage of patients alive at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively); safety of MK-3475 in GBM.

 (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if there is a correlation of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) expression and T-cell infiltrate in pathology from first and, if applicable, second surgical specimens with outcome.

 (Phase I/II) II.

 Assess changes in peripheral T-cell activation and tryptophan metabolites.

 (Phase I/II) III.

 Correlate o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) status with outcome.

 (Phase I/II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab, followed by a phase II study.

 RT PORTION: Patients undergo focal RT over 42 days, and receive concurrent temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43.

 POST-RT: After completion of RT, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5 and 29-34 of course 1 and days 1-5 and 29-33 of subsequent courses, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43.

 Treatment repeats every 9 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After 6 courses, patients deriving benefit may continue to receive pembrolizumab for an additional 12 months.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months.

 Radiation Therapy With Temozolomide and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma@highlight

The purpose of phase I trial is to determine the safest, most effective dose of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), when used with radiotherapy and temozolomide for treating newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (GBM).

 Phase II trial will evaluate if MK-3475 used in combination with temozolomide and radiation followed by radiation and temozolomide to see if this is better than using radiation and temozolomide alone.

 Temozolomide binds to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), changes it, and triggers the death of tumor cells.

 MK-3475 is an investigational drug, it is not currently approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating GBM but it is approved for treating melanoma.

 MK-3475 works by targets the local tumor immune-protection in solid tumors.

 It is hoped the addition of MK-3475 to the usual treatment for GBM will improve the current treatment.
