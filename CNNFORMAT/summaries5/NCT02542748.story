(secondQuint)Comparison of Norepinephrine and Ephedrine on Hypotension After Spinal Anesthesia in Parturients.

 Spinal anesthesia is an accepted technique in elective cesarean sections.

 However, hypotension, resulted from sympathectomy is a common problem, especially in pregnant women.

 Prevention of this complication by sympathomimetic agents is of potential clinical significance.

 Ephedrine could be used to treat hypotension but lead to lower fetal pH, which may be related to worse fetal outcome.

Norepinephrine could improve the hypotension to the same extent as phenylephrine.

 In this study, we tend to compare the effects of norepinephrine and ephedrine on hypotension in parturients and on fetal acid status.

 Comparison of Norepinephrine and Ephedrine on Hypotension After Spinal Anesthesia in Parturients@highlight

Incidence of hypotension is high in parturients after spinal anesthesia.

 Ephedrine could be used to treat hypotension but lead to lower fetal pH as well.

 This study is to compare the effects of norepinephrine and ephedrine on hypotension in parturients.
