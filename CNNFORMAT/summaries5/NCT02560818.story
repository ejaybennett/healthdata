(fifthQuint)Transcriptomes Breast, Ovarian and Leukocyte Hereditary Genes Predisposing to Breast and / or Ovarian Cancer.

 This study requires two steps: - The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 10 women free of breast cancer and, or ovarian Family (healthy volunteers controls) and without a known family history of breast and or ovarian cancer.

 Mapping the level of blood (leukocytes) and the breast tissue will be drawn for the same individual on the physiological profiles splicing of the messenger RNA of genes involved in this predisposition, targeted by high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNASeq).

 A direct comparison of RNA splicing patterns between blood and breast tissue from the same witness will detect any differences between these two tissues.

 -The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients predisposed to familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 10 controls with no known family history of breast and, or ovarian cancer.

 Analysis of the results will highlight potential splicing abnormalities.

This is a case-control study of molecular diagnostics.

 This study requires two steps: - The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 10 women without breast cancer and, or ovarian family (Healthy Volunteers controls) - The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients predisposed to familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 10 controls .

 For analysis of leucocytes of the patients, a blood sample collected in a prior study (EXSAL study, ID-RCB 2009-A00833-54) will be used.
