(secondQuint)Detection of BRAF Mutation on FNAB From Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.

 The BRAF mutation is reported to be present in approximately 50% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC).

 The mutation has been associated with poor prognosis and more advanced disease stage.

 Therefore, pre-operative detection of the BRAF-V600E mutation may be of clinical interest in order to individualize treatment of patients with BRAF positive PTC.

 FNABs are performed immediately before the thyroid operation, and BRAF-V600E detection using VE1 is performed on clots.

 The VE1 stain is compared to the mutation status of the removed cancer or control tissue using the Cobas test.
