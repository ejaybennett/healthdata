(fifthQuint)Histopathological Response to FOLFOXIRI + Bevacizumab in Peritoneal Metastasis From Colorectal Cancer.

 Peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer (pcCRC) has a dismal prognosis.

 In the era of 5-fluorouracil treatment and palliative surgery only, median survival ranged from 5.

2 to 7.

0 months.

 In patients with bowel obstruction due to peritoneal carcinomatosis outcome was even worse, with a median overall survival of less than 4 months and a 1-year survival rate of 17%.

 With the advent of modern chemotherapy regimens, survival has improved considerably.

 However, the presence of pcCRC is still associated with a significantly worse prognosis as compared with other manifestations of metastatic CRC (e.

g.

 liver and/or lung metastasis).

 A recent retrospective analysis of 2095 patients from 2 prospective randomized trials showed that both median PFS and OS were significantly shorter for patients with pcCRC as compared with patients without pcCRC (PFS: 5.

 The study was able to show that the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 75% for patients with a pCR (HR=1) as compared with 57% for patients with a major response (HR=4.

91) and only 13% for patients with a minor or no response (HR=13.

46) (p=0.

01).

 Overall, approximately 30% of patients were considered to be responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (9.

7% pCR + 20.

2% major response), while about 70% of patients were considered non-responders to treatment.

 Treatment consisted of a FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI-based regimen in the majority of patients.

 The primary objective of the study is to prospectively assess the histopathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab in peritoneal tumor deposits of 30 patients with pcCRC by determining the percentage of viable tumor cells in the resected specimen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 For patients with multiple peritoneal specimens, the median percentage of viable cells in all specimens will be used.

 Patients with 0-49% of viable cells will be considered as responders.

 The timepoint of the assessment of the primary objective will be during re-exploratory surgery/surgical cytoreduction between days 78 and 106 of the treatment phase of the study.

 The investigators hypothesize that there will be >30% responders after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab.

 Responders will be defined as patients with pCR (0% viable tumor cells) and major response (1-49% viable tumor cells) after FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy.

 Non-responders will be defined as patients with minor/no response (50% viable tumor cells) after FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy.

 The following patients will also be counted as non-responders: - Patients who do not undergo surgical re-exploration - Patients who develop extraabdominal metastases - Deaths before surgical re-exploration.

 Histopathological Response to FOLFOXIRI + Bevacizumab in Peritoneal Metastasis From Colorectal Cancer@highlight

There is a paucity of data on the histopathological response of peritoneal tumor deposits from colorectal cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 Particularly, no prospective assessment of chemotherapy-associated histopathological response within the peritoneum has been performed so far.

 Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct a clinical trial aimed at prospectively assessing the histopathological response within the peritoneum in patients with peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer.

 Recently, Loupakis et al.

 reported that the triplet regimen of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) in combination with bevacizumab significantly improved median progression-free survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients from 9.

7 to 12.

1 months as compared with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) + bevacizumab.

 In view of these data, it is likely that FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab will also lead to a significant improvement of the histopathological response within the peritoneum of patients with peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer (pcCRC) as compared with previous standard chemotherapy.

 The investigators hypothesize that FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab will induce a pCR or major response in peritoneal tumor deposits in >30% of patients (taking the response rate to FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy from the published literature as a reference).
