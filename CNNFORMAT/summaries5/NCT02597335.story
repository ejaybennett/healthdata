(fifthQuint)Non Invasive Detection of IDH1/2 Mutation in Gliomas.

 The aim of this trial is to develop and validate a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1 mutated gliomas.

 It will evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of D-2HG detection by Brain Spectro MRI.

 This approach will be coupled with mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA and D-2HG dosage in urine samples.

 The primary end-point is the quantification of D-2HG by spectro-MRI, and the correlation with the dosage of D-2HG in the tumor fragment, and the mutational status (group 1: 25 patients).

 The secondary endpoints include: 1.

 longitudinal analysis Spectro-MRI overtime (12 months) correlation with radiological evolution and the response to treatment (group 2: 15 patients) 2.

 Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation induced changes 3.

 Confrontation of Spectro-MRI, D-2HG dosages and IDH mutation detection from plasma DNA, and elaboration of a combined score of prediction.

 Non Invasive Detection of IDH1/2 Mutation in Gliomas@highlight

This trial develops a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1 mutated gliomas combining mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA, D-2HG dosage in urine samples, and D-2HG detection by Brain Spectro MRI.

 In group 1 (25 patients), patients with presumed grade II-III gliomas candidate to surgery will undergo spectro MRI, plasma, urine dosages.

 Results will then be confronted to tumor mutational status and D-2HG.

 In group 2 (15 patients), patients with known IDH1 mutation will undergo spectro MRI, plasma, urine dosages overtime in order to correlate results with the response to treatment.
