(firstQuint)Midkine and ACE-Ang II Induced Endothelial Injury in Sepsis.

 This study showed that Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis patients.

 Midkine has been shown to regulate the renin-angiotensin system and acts in the upstream signaling pathway of angiotensin (ANG) II.

 The investigators want to access the relationship between midkine level and ACE-Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis.
