(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Acarbose+Saxagliptin Compared With Metformin+Saxagliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Participants coming on study will be assigned to two groups:Acarbose+Saxagliptin and Metformin+Saxagliptin.

 It may take 1 weeks to be stabilize to a standardized dose, and then the investigators will follow-up the patients for 3 months.

During the period,patients will be asked to come back to the investigators center to receive the related examination every month.
