(thirdQuint)The Use of i/t Curve in Assessment of Phototherapy Effects.

 Electrodiagnostic Studies (i/t curve), chronaxies, rheobase (i/t curve), Electrodiagnostic Studies will be conducted before a series of 10 phototherapy treatments and after their completion.

 Pain threshold assessment with algometer will be conducted before a series of 10 phototherapy treatments and after their completion.

 Assessment of sensitivity to compression (pound/cm2).

 Creation of 3 test groups: 1 - Piler light + red filter, 2 - Piler light + blue filter, 3 - Piler light without a filter.

 Creation of a numerical coefficient for i/t curve.

 monitoring of changes in numerical coefficient after phototherapy.
