(fifthQuint)Cavity Shaving in Breast Conserving Surgery for Breast Cancer Patients.

 After stratified and blocked randomization, the patients' name, admission ID and treatment assignment will be written on a slip of paper, and will be placed in a sealed envelop.

 A label with the patients' name and admission ID will be placed on the sealed envelop, which will be kept in a locked file.

 On the day of surgery, a research coordinator will bring the sealed envelope to the operation room.

 During the standard-of-care BCS, the tumor was excised with a rim of grossly normal tissue.

 Additional resections are allowed when any of the margins of the tumor-containing specimen were suspected to be inadequate on the basis of standard gross evaluation by surgeons.

 Prior to intra-operative CM assessment, the research co-ordinator will unseal the envelop and determine which procedure has been designated to the patient.

 The cosmetic outcome and the quality of life will be evaluated at the day of discharge, after completion of radiotherapy and one year by the patient herself, her partner and a research co-ordinator.

 Cavity Shaving in Breast Conserving Surgery for Breast Cancer Patients@highlight

This randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of additional cavity shaving (CS) on pathological cavity margin (CM) status in breast cancer patients.

 Patients receiving standard breast-conserving surgery (BCS) will be randomized to intra-operative CM assessment versus intra-operative CS followed by CM assessment.

 The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CS on intra-operative CM status, intra-operative re-excision rate, post-operative CM status and re-excision rate, cosmetic outcomes, and on intraoperative time and medical costs.
