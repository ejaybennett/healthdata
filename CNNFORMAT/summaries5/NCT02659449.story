(firstQuint)Assessing the Impact of Different Compression of the Hand Versus Free Hand on the Implementation of the Precision Grip.

 Patients with burned hands will realise prehension test to explore dexterity of hand when they wear compressive's treatments and with free hands.

 Each patient will realise each test with all conditions (free hands/ made to measure gloves/ compressive bandaging).

 Running order of test and condition is randomly defined.

 Each patient realized this tests under the care and devices used at usual care.

 Realisation of this tests are not influenced by the study.

 Patient realised this tests during reeducation.

 Assessing the Impact of Different Compression of the Hand Versus Free Hand on the Implementation of the Precision Grip@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of compressing therapy on the dexterity of burned hands using evaluating hand function tests (Box and block / Purdue Peg Board / Jamar's test)
