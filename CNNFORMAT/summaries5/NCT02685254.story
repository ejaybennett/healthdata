(fifthQuint)Effects of Structured Skills Training Group in Treatment of ADHD in Adults.

 Background: The focus in recent years on evidence for non-pharmacological treatment in adults with ADHD raises the question of potential effects of structured group therapy.

 Structured skills training groups have shown beneficial effects in some studies in an outpatient psychiatric context by reduction in ADHD symptoms in individuals who remained stable regarding medication status.

 Aims: The main objective for the trial is to investigate the potential effects of structured skills training groups in a clinically relevant but still controlled setting on broader outcomes including both symptomatic, functional and health related quality of life measures.

 Methods/Design: The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled parallel group design.

 At each outpatient site the enrolled patients are randomized into two groups for either Group 1 (G1) with start of weekly treatment in active structured skills training group lasting for 14 weeks or allocated to Group 2 (G2) with treatment as usual/clinical management and with 15 weeks delayed start of their group treatment for comparison wth patients in the other arm.

 Those patients in the control condition arm receiving treatment as usual or clinical management of individual patients (G2), are thereafter switched to active structured skills training group therapy.

All patients are followed up after six months with assessments of primary and secondary outcomes.

 Effects of Structured Skills Training Group in Treatment of ADHD in Adults@highlight

This study aims to examine if structured skills training group therapy for ADHD in adults has beneficial effects superior to 'treatment as usual' including medication in a controlled outpatient setting on clinically relevant outcomes including symptoms, functioning and quality of life measures.

 The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled, parallel group study.

 Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms with 14-week duration: one arm with initial intervention by structured skills training groups by weekly sessions or one with control condition (treatment as usual).

 Then after 15 weeks patients in the control condition arm are switched to the active intervention by 14 weeks of structured group therapy.

 All patients are assessed for defined outcomes after six months.
