(secondQuint)Active Breathing Coordinator-based vs VisionRT-based Deep Inspiration Breath-hold for Radiation for Breast Cancer.

 Female patients treated with radiation for left-sided breast malignancy will undergo alternate fractions of ABC-assisted and VisionRT-assisted DIBH.

 Residual motion during breath-hold will be quantitatively assessed using MV fluoroscopy from the treatment beam itself (i.

e.

, no additional radiation dose).

 The dosimetric impact of residual motion on organs at risk (heart and lung) will be assessed by applying rigid and/or deformable displacements to the planning CT images, computing the 3D dose map and comparing with the original planned dose map.
