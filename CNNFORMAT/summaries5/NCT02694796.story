 Impact of Web and Smartphone-based Physical Activity Program on Physical Activity Level 12 Months After a Balneotherapy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an intervention combining a workshop during a balneotherapy and the use after the end of the balneotherapy of a web and smartphone-based physical activity program using connected devices, on physical activity level among patients 12 months after they participated in a balneotherapy in thermal care center.

 A multi center randomized controlled trial is setting to evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity recommendations achievement of the patients.

 Investigators hypothesize that an intervention including a workshop during a balneotherapy and an automated physical activity program using web, mobile phone and connected devices will help patients to be engaged in more physical activities and to reach physical activity recommendations.
