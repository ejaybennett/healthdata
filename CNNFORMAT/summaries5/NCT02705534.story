(secondQuint)Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir, Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Cirrhotics, Genotype 1.

 Cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) presents a rather difficult treatment problem as many cannot tolerate interferon, the previous standard of care.

 The new direct acting antivirals have provided these patients with a new hope.

 One such combination is sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and ledipasvir (LDV) 90 mg given once daily with or without weight-based ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks only for HCV genotype 1 patients.

 The current recommendation for cirrhotics (genotype 1) is SOF/LDV/RBV for 24 weeks but that recommendation is based on the lack of data for shorter periods.

 In order to evaluate the response rate to the combination of SOF/LDV/RBV the investigators decided to treat 50 HCV genotype 1 cirrhotics with this combination for 12 weeks.

 Patients with MELD score > 20 are excluded.

 The investigators will calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks (SVR12).

The investigators will treat 50 patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C genotype 1, with sofosbuvir 400 mg daily, ledipasvir 90 mg daily and weight-based ribavirin (1000 mg/d if 75 kg, divided in two daily doses) for 12 weeks and calculate the sustained viral response rate at 12 weeks.
