(fifthQuint)The Lymphoid Tissue Pharmacology of Antiretroviral Drugs.

 This is a single-center study of 18 ARV naive, HIV infected persons to assess impact of an ARV regimen on lymph node (LN) and (GALT) virus reservoirs.

 All participants will give informed consent.

 At baseline, plasma and PBMCs will be obtained and all subjects will have an incisional biopsy of an inguinal LN and pinch biopsy of ileum and rectum via colonoscopy.

 The selected LT-enhanced ARV regimen will be initiated.

 Participants will return to the clinic at weeks 2 and 4 and then monthly for safety evaluations, CD4 T cell counts, plasma HIV-RNA and ARV drug concentrations in plasma and PBMCs.

 An intensive PK study will be performed at week 2.

 At months 3 and 6, the inguinal LN biopsy and pinch biopsies of ileum and rectum will be repeated.

 The Lymphoid Tissue Pharmacology of Antiretroviral Drugs@highlight

Hypothesis: Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) with enhanced LT penetration characteristics in vitro and in macaques will translate into an ARV regimen with increased LN and GALT concentrations and a faster decay and more potent suppression of HIV replication in LT in HIV-infected persons.

 Objectives: 1.

 Determine lymph nodes (LN) and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) pharmacokinetics (PK) in HIV-infected persons on an antiretroviral drug (ARV) regimen.

 2.

 Determine virological responses of antiretroviral therapy in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphoid tissue (LT).
