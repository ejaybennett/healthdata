(fifthQuint)Dendritic Cell/Myeloma Fusion Vaccine for Multiple Myeloma (BMT CTN 1401).

 The study is a three-arm, phase II randomized, open-labeled clinical trial that randomizes patients to vaccination with Dendritic Cell (DC)/myeloma fusions/GM-CSF plus lenalidomide maintenance therapy or lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF following autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment for patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

 Patients are randomized at a day 60 +/- 7 days post transplant and will begin maintenance lenalidomide between day 90 and 100.

 The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare the proportion of patients alive and in complete response (defined as CR or sCR) at one year post transplant between patients receiving DC/myeloma vaccine/GM-CSF with lenalidomide maintenance therapy to those receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF.

 Dendritic Cell/Myeloma Fusion Vaccine for Multiple Myeloma (BMT CTN 1401)@highlight

The study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter trial of vaccination with Dendritic cell/myeloma fusions with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) adjuvant plus lenalidomide maintenance therapy versus maintenance therapy alone or with GM-CSF following autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).

 It is hypothesized that the dendritic cell myeloma vaccine will result in improved response in patients with multiple myeloma after autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT).
