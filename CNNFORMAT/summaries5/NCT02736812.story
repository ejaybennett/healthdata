(fifthQuint)Pre-hospital Administration of Lyophilized Plasma for Post-traumatic Coagulopathy Treatment (PREHO-PLYO).

 In severe bleeding due to trauma, a fall in coagulation factors maintains and promotes bleeding.

 The plasma allows, through its contribution of coagulation factors, early prevention or correction of this post-traumatic coagulopathy.

 This labile blood product has so far only been used in armed conflicts by military medical and surgical units deployed in External Operations (EXOP) to meet the logistical constraints of the operating environment and the need to have, without delay, therapeutic plasma to treat bleeding casualties.

 Unlike frozen plasma used in hospitals, FLYP is stored at room temperature and is reconstituted in less than 6 mins.

 In the civilian world, FLYP could be used by health institutions who have major logistical difficulties which do not allow them to ensure a cold chain of sub-zero temperatures, or in extreme emergency situations with the need for an immediate therapeutic plasma supply.

 In this second indication, FLYP should be used until the fresh frozen plasma is thawed and available.

 Its use in pre-hospital situations is also justified due to its immediate availability and storage conditions.

 FLYP is sterile and is in powder-form with a residual humidity not exceeding 2%.

 It is packaged in a sterile and pyrogenic glass vial.

 The main objective is to show the effectiveness of pre-hospital administered FLYP during treatment of a traumatic hemorrhagic shock, in the occurrence or the treatment of a post traumatic coagulopathy.

 The secondary objectives are: - the usability of administering pre-hospital FLYP - show that FLYP improves fibrinogen levels - show that use of FLYP decreases transfusion requirements (RBC, plasma, coagulation factors, platelets, fibrinogen) - show that use of FLYP reduces length of stay in ICU - compare mortality between the 2 groups to day 30 Method The attribution of the experimental treatment (FLYP or saline), to each patient who will receive a treatment numbered from 1 to 140, was carried out in advance using STATA 14.

0 software.

 Type of randomisation : randomisation in blocks of 2, stratified by center.

 Treatments are allocated to participants in each "pre-hospital" center by ascending number.

 Participants and investigators are therefore not blind to the allocated treatment.

 However, the statistical analysis is planned to be carried out as a blind study regarding knowledge of the allocated treatment.

 The planned experimental design is identical for each pre-hospital investigation centre.

 Care of a patient in traumatic hemorrhagic shock is identical from one investigating centre to another: it is based on formalized expert recommendations on hemorrhagic shock resuscitation.

 Determination of the number of subjects required An " after versus before" observational study on external military operations in patients presenting with a haemorrhage of traumatic origin, reported a significant improvement in level of Prothrombin during the "after" period (which corresponded with FLYP administration - The before period corresponded with Saline infusion without any FLYP).

 In total, 124 patients were required to observe a statistically significant difference (p <0.

001).

 In the absence of another publication on the subject we propose to include 70 patients per group, which should allow the significant results of the observational study cited above to be replicated.

 There is no planned interim analysis.

 The administration of the treatment in the study is stopped if any adverse event (AE) occurs (abnormal clinical manifestation,.

.

.

) and the offending experimental treatment is retained.

 Usual care and corrective actions are continued in the field, during transport and at the receiving hospital.

 An independent oversight committee meeting is organized to discuss the stopping or the continuation of the study according to the nature of the AE.

 Comparability of groups for the primary endpoint Regarding the primary endpoint : variations in prothrombin levels between the initial moment of pre-hospital care (before administration of FLYP) and the time of arrival at the hospital (after FLYP), this variation it will be compared between the group that received FLYP vs the group that received the usual treatment (saline) by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted to the delay between the two samples and the age.

 Comparability of groups for the secondary endpoint - The usability of administering FLYP will be judged on the grounds of interruption or non-administration of the experimental treatment, depending on the ability to respect the procedure and the use of a Labile Blood Product according to the rules of good practice.

 - The average differential (pre-hospital -hospital) of fibrinogen levels between the two groups will be compared by an ANCOVA adjusted on the delay between the two samples and the age.

 - Transfusion requirement will be judged by the number or median amount transfused after arrival at the hospital: packed red blood cells (RBC), platelet concentrates, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and plasma.

 The transfusion requirement will be measured over a period of 24 to 48 hours.

 - The median number of days in the ICU between the two groups will use the medians test - Survival analysis up to 30 days will be based on the comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves, by the log-rank test, and a Cox model to estimate the role of administration of FLYP on survival, taking into account potential confounding factors.

 - Regarding the secondary endpoint : variations in fibrinogen blood levels between the initial moment of pre-hospital care (before administration of FLYP) and the time of arrival at the hospital (after FLYP), this variation in fibrinogen will be compared between the group that received FLYP vs the group that received the usual treatment (saline) by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted to the delay between the two samples and the age.

 INTERRUPTION OR STOPPING OF THE STUDY The sponsor has the responsibility to report, to the national health authority , any serious and unexpected adverse events attributable to the labile blood product of cell therapy and/or protocol within 15 days (7 days in case of death and life-threatening situations).

 In the case of occurrence of an incident, accident, or event, interruption of the study is planned after analysis and decision by the hemovigilance and safety committee of the study.

 RISKS A full report on the risks, the description of incidents, accidents and adverse events will be the subject of a chapter in the results section and also in the discussion.

 FINANCING Funding for the study is provided by the Health Department of the Army (promoter, following the acceptance of the study in the context of Clinical research projects in the Health service of armies).

 DISCUSSION The study must confirm the link between causality of early administration of plasma in improving post-traumatic coagulopathy.

 The study must show safe usage in out-of-hospital situations and the ability of medical staff to meet the requirements of the health authorities in terms of product use as well as in terms of traceability of the victims and the treatment they received.

 CONCLUSION This is the first study that aims to assess the usability and benefits of FLYP extra hospital use.

 Pre-hospital Administration of Lyophilized Plasma for Post-traumatic Coagulopathy Treatment (PREHO-PLYO)@highlight

In severe bleeding due to trauma, a fall in coagulation factors maintains and promotes bleeding.

 The plasma allows, through its contribution of coagulation factors, early prevention or correction of this post-traumatic coagulopathy.

 The main objective is to show the effectiveness of pre-hospital administered FLYP during treatment of a traumatic hemorrhagic shock, in the occurrence or the treatment of a post traumatic coagulopathy.

 Study Design This is a Randomized controlled multicenter open study in two parallel groups.

 Eligibility criteria : adult, victim of a hemorrhagic shock of traumatic origin with [systolic blood pressure 108], or Shock Index >1.

3 at some point in the medicalized care.

 Two groups of 70 patients will receive either FLYP+ the usual treatment for post traumatic hemorrhagic shock as given in the recommendations for best practice, or saline perfusion but no FLYP, as given in the recommendations for best practice.

 The primary endpoint is the variation in the level of Prothrombin (PR), between the PR at hospital admission and the PR originally taken in the pre-hospital period.

- The secondary endpoints are: compilation of technical and logistical difficulties encountered before, during and after administration of FLYP ; the change in fibrinogen level between fibrinogen level at hospital admission and fibrinogen level originally taken in the pre-hospital period.

 The study must confirm the link between causality of early administration of plasma in improving post-traumatic coagulopathy.

 The study must show safe usage in out-of-hospital situations and the ability of medical staff to meet the requirements of the health authorities in terms of product use as well as in terms of traceability of the victims and the treatment they received.
