(fifthQuint)Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention for Returning Combat Veterans.

.

 This research study is being done to determine if Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention (OT-DI) can improve the safe driving performance (less errors) over the short term (immediately following intervention) and intermediate term (3 months).

 Baseline testing-Pre-test 1-- will include clinical battery of tests and a simulated driving test, a Brief Driving Questionnaire, Community Integration Questionnaire, and a Satisfaction with Life Questionnaire.

 Caregivers/ family members will rate the participants' driving behaviors using a Fitness-to-Drive Screening Measure( FTDS).

 After baseline testing the 60 participants (and 60 associated caregivers) will be randomly assigned to a balanced intervention group (15 participants with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)/ Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and 15 participants with orthopedic conditions and caregivers) and a control group (15 with TBI/PTSD and 15 with orthopedic conditions and caregivers).

 The intervention group receives Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention (OT-DI), consisting of three x 1 hour sessions will include: Session 1: Driving evaluator reviews explicit driving errors with participants; Session 2: Driving evaluator provide tailored strategies to mitigate errors; Session 3: Participants drive simulator with targeted feedback from driving evaluator.

 The control group will receive, from a driving safety professional, three x 1 hour general safety sessions (Session 1: General traffic safety discussion; Session 2: Rules of the road and knowledge of the road discussion; Session 3: drive the simulator without any feedback from traffic safety professional).

 Immediately after session 3, Post-test 1 will occur using the same standardized protocol outlined for baseline testing.

 Post-test 2 will consist of testing with the same standardized protocol as administered during baseline testing.

 Caregivers/ family members will rate the participant driving behaviors using the FTDS.

 In addition, the investigators will obtain driving data from the Department of Motor Vehicles which will include: citations, violations, driving mishaps, and crashes that have occurred for each participant.

 Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention for Returning Combat Veterans.

@highlight

Driving is a portal into general life functioning, and impaired driving skill can pose a serious threat to the combat veterans (CV), passengers and others; and involves increased risk of subsequent injuries, medical expenses and legal sequelae.

 Motor vehicle crashes (MVC) among post deployed CV are one of the top four causes of injury and disability, hospitalization, and outpatient visits across the military, and are a leading cause of death among Army service members.

 The risk of motor vehicle (MV) death is significantly increased in years immediately following return from the battlefield.

 In sum, the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)/ Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other blast related injuries, combined with the "battlefield" mindset and lack of community reintegration programs place CV at risk for MVC and fatalities.

 On-road assessments, the gold standard, presents a risk for crash or adverse advents in this population of CV.

 Alternately, simulated driving evaluation measures driving performance in a safe, accurate and objective manner with evidence of absolute and relative validity when compared to real world (on-road) driving.

 Knowing participants can or cannot safely resume driving, and providing rehabilitation for those with a potential for resuming safe driving could result in: increased safe driving behaviors; avoidance of injuries, collisions, citations and participants residua; and resuming safe driving with its attendant benefits in the realms of family functioning, participation in society and satisfaction with life.

 The overarching objective of this proposal is to discern, after clinical and simulated driving performance testing , if Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention (OT-DI) can improve the safe driving performance (less errors) over the short term (immediately following intervention) and intermediate term (3 months).
