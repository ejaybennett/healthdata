(firstQuint)Assessment of Peripheral Perfusion in the Critically Ill Patient.

 The aim of this study is to validate PPI as a continuous, objective measurement of peripheral perfusion indicated by clinical sings of tissue perfusion in patients with septic shock.

 Furthermore, PPI shall be compared to the perfusion of solid organs evaluated by ultrasound of liver, kidney and gut.

 In a group of healthy volunteers the investigators will determine normal values in ambient temperature and after cooling of an extremity.

 Another group of patients after cardiac surgery, where usually a poor tissue perfusion without metabolic failure is present will serve as another "control" population in their post-surgery stabilization period.

 The values from healthy volunteers and cardiac surgery patients will be compared to those of patients in septic shock.

 Assessment of Peripheral Perfusion in the Critically Ill Patient@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate PPI as a surrogate for clinical signs of peripheral perfusion in patients in septic shock and after cardiac surgery.
