(thirdQuint)RANKL-blockade for the Treatment of Erosive Osteoarthritis (OA) of Interphalangeal Finger Joints.

 Investigational therapy: denosumab 60mg subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks.

 All subjects will receive Calcium/vit D supplementation.

 Efficacy objectives: The primary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic erosive progression using GUSS (Ghent University Score System).

 The secondary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic erosive progression as defined by diminishing the appearance of new erosive IP finger joints.

 The exploratory objective is mainly to assess the effect of denosumab on clinical variables, as well as ultrasonography and DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) parameters.
