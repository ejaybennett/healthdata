(thirdQuint)B-mode Ultrasound Imaging in Detecting Early Liver Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To investigate the use of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy to detect early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an inexpensive and widely available quantitative (i.

e.

 robust) method to confirm disease in developing countries.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo B-mode ultrasound imaging of the liver over 15 minutes.

 B-mode Ultrasound Imaging in Detecting Early Liver Cancer@highlight

This pilot trial studies how well B-mode ultrasound imaging works in detecting liver cancer that is early in its growth and may not have spread to other parts of the body.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as B-mode ultrasound imaging, may help find and diagnose liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.
