(thirdQuint)Selective Lymph Node Dissection Using Fluorescent Dye in Node-positive Breast Cancer.

 Low dose of indocyanine green emits near-infrared fluorescence, which can penetrate thin tissues like breast or skin.

 The operator can track the lymphatic pathway without skin incision in real time.

 By these characteristics, indocyanine green is currently used for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer surgery.

 Indocyanine green can also stain lymph nodes beyond the sentinel lymph nodes.

 This is why we can identify the lymphatic metastasis pathway of breast cancer.

In this study, navigation of lymphatic passage after sentinel lymph node with indocyanine green was performed during axillary lymph node dissection in breast surgery .

 By comparing the concordance between the passage of indocyanine green and actual lymph node metastasis, selective lymph node dissection can be developed.
