(fifthQuint)Comparative Study of Three Different Embryo Transfer Media in ICSI Cycles.

 Two or three embryos will be transferred at day 5 after ovum pick-up (OPU).

 The patients will be divided randomly (closed envelop method) into 3 groups: - Group A (50 patients): embryos will be transferred using a medium supplemented with 0.

5 mg/mL of hyaluronic acid (EmbryoGlue(R), Vitrolife, Sweden) for 20 minutes before intrauterine transfer took place - Group B (50 patients): embryos will be transferred using a medium of 30% Protein-supplemented Culture Medium (Global total(R), Life Global group, Canada) for 20 minutes.

 - Group C (50 patients): a novel technique in which embryos will be transferred using a medium of autologous Follicular Fluid for 20 minutes.

 Follicular fluid will be collected in a sterile procedure, centrifuged for 20 minutes in an embryo test tube.

 The supernatant will be removed in a sterilized technique then heated to 56C for 30 minutes then filtered through 0.

22 micron filter.

 Gentamycin sulphate will be added at a concentration of 10 mu g/mL then the liquid is preserved in a normal freezer.

 Defreezing follicular fluid will be performed at day-1 before embryo transfer.

 The follicular fluid will be warmed to room temperature.

 Preparation of embryo transfer media will be performed as usual, will be covered with paraffin oil (Ovoil(R), Vitrolife, Sweeden) and then incubated overnight in 7% CO2, 9% O2, 22% N2.

 All embryo transfers will be performed using an embryo transfer catheter (Labotect catheter, Labotect GmbH, Germany).

 Number of embryos transferred will be according to ASRM guideline 2013 on day 5 after ovum pick-up (OPU).

 Comparative Study of Three Different Embryo Transfer Media in ICSI Cycles@highlight

The study design is a prospective randomized uncontrolled clinical trial.

 It will include 150 cases.

 The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of three different media used for embryo transfer regarding "chemical and clinical" pregnancy rate, implantation rate and ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage rates in IVF and ICSI cycles.

 The three different embryo transfer media are: 1.

 Hyaluronan-enriched medium "Embryo Glue(R)" 2.

 30% Protein-supplemented Culture medium "Global Total(R)" 3.

 Autologous Follicular Fluid (a Novel technique) In order to establish the optimal media for embryo transfer
