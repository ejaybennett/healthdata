(firstQuint)Drug-Interaction Study to Evaluate the Effect of Rifampin, a Potent CYP3A4 Inducer, on the Systemic Exposure of Pacritinib in Healthy Subjects.

 This was a single-center, open-label, one-way crossover, drug-interaction study.

 On Day 1, subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib.

 Following a 7-day washout period, 600-mg oral doses of rifampin were administered once daily (QD) on Days 8 through 17.

 It was anticipated that steady-state concentrations of rifampin would be achieved by Day 17.

 On Day 17, a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 600-mg dose of rifampin.

The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of rifampin, a potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, at steady-state on the systemic exposure of a single dose of pacritinib in healthy subjects.
