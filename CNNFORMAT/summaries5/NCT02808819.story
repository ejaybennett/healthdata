(secondQuint)A Safety Extension Study With Benralizumab for Asthmatic Adults on Inhaled Corticosteroid Plus Long-acting 2 Agonist.

 This is an open-label safety extension study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in severe asthma patients on inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting 2 agonist (ICS-LABA) therapy with or without chronic oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or other asthma controllers.

 All patients will receive active drug on the same dosing regimen they received in BORA.

 In order to protect the blind of BORA, patients will remain blinded to treatment regimen allocation until they have completed all end of treatment (EOT) assessments in BORA and signed informed consent for participation in this study, after which treatment allocation will be unblinded to both the investigator and the patient.

The purpose of this study is to continue to characterize the safety profile of benralizumab administration and monitor the pharmacodynamic activity of the drug in those asthma patients who remain on treatment for at least 16 weeks and not more than 40 weeks in the predecessor study D3250C00021 (BORA).
