(thirdQuint)Ifosfamide, Doxorubicin and Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Neoadjuvant Sarcoma Treatment.

 Prospective phase II non controlled study.

 Staging: All patients will be submitted to a local Magnetic Resonance (MR), Chest Tomography (CT) and Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET CT) previous to treatment.

 After the first cT cycle a new PET CT will be provided and one more at the end of the neoadjuvant treatment.

 Chemotherapy: cT neoadjuvant: Doxorubicin 75mg/m2 (cycles 1,2 and 3), and ifosfamide 9 g/m2 (cycles 1 and 3).

 Radiotherapy: RT 25 Gy / 5 x 500 cGy/day, beginning at Cycle 2/Day1.

 The surgery will be performed after 4-6 weeks from cycle 3.

 The remain of viable cells in surgical specimen will be analyzed and whether the the percentage value is less than 30% the patient will receive more 3 cycles of cT.

 A boost of RT is indicated if margins are considered R1 (microscopic positive margin).
