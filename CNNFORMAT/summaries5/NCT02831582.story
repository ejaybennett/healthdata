(thirdQuint)Omega-3 Supplementation in Prevention of Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Toxicity in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the efficacy of the complementary therapy omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation in preventing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias (AIIAs).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To prospectively define the population most at risk for developing AIIAs by the identification and validation of genetic risk predictors and to develop a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/gene profile predictive of treatment intervention response.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 Group I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months.

 Group II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

 After completion of study, patients will be followed up periodically.

 Omega-3 Supplementation in Prevention of Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Toxicity in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer@highlight

This clinical trial studies the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing aromatase inhibitor-induced toxicity in patients with stage I-III breast cancer.

 An omega-3 supplementation may help relieve moderate to severe bone pain and improve joint symptoms caused by aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias.
