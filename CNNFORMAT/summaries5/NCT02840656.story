(thirdQuint)Microbial Epidemiology and Chlorhexidine Suscebtibily of Oropharyngeal and Intestinal Colonization.

 In this prospective observational study we aim to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal and rectal Gram-negative bacilli colonization in 100 healthy subjects, and their susceptibility to chlorehexidine.

 Each participant will undego a oropharyngeal swab collection and a rectal swab at day 0.

 The Gram-negative bacilli colonization will be identified, E.

 coli isolates will be studied in terms of phylogeny; gram-negative isolates will be studied in terms of antimicrobial and chlorhexidine susceptibility.

 The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli colonization.

 The secondary objectives are to determine the chlorhexidine and antimicrobial susceptibility of such colonization; to determine the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and rectal predominant E.

 coli isolates; to compare the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and rectal E.

 coli isolates.
