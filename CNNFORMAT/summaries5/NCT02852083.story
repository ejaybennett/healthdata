(secondQuint)A Trial With Metronomic Low-dose Treosulfan, Pioglitazone and Clarithromycin Versus Standard Treatment in NSCLC.

 Patients will be randomized 1:1, and will be stratified according to histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma).

 86 patients with platin refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will be treated either with metronomic low-dose treosulfan, pioglitazone and clarithromycin (experimental arm) or with nivolumab (squamous cell lung cancer and nonsquamous cell lung cancer).

 Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline and every 6 weeks (approximately every two cycles) thereafter, until progression.

 Patients without progression after 36 weeks will undergo tumor assessments every 12 weeks.
