(thirdQuint)Shotgun Sequencing in Diagnosing Febrile Neutropenia in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To test the hypothesis that shotgun metagenomics is not inferior to standard of care diagnostics in the detection of pathogens in patients with febrile neutropenia.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To establish a microbiological diagnosis with known or unknown pathogens in patients in whom standard care failed to yield a pathogenic diagnosis.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of blood samples before and during the episode of febrile neutropenia for up to 6 weeks.

 Shotgun Sequencing in Diagnosing Febrile Neutropenia in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

This research trial studies the shotgun sequencing of blood samples in diagnosing febrile neutropenia in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

 Studying samples of blood from patients with acute myeloid leukemia in the laboratory may help identify pathogens and accurately diagnose infections such as febrile neutropenia.
