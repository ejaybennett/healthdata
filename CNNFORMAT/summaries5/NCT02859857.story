(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Study of BXQ-350 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a first in man study of BXQ-350, a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent composed of two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes.

 When both the components are assembled together forming stable SapC-DOPS nanovesicles (clinical formulation BXQ-350), the agent exhibits the propensity to enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death.

 The study is divided into 2 parts: 1.

 Dose Escalation Scheme Sequential cohorts of adult patients with advanced solid tumors and recurrent high-grade gliomas will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is established, or in the absence of a MAD, the highest planned DL.

 2.

 During Part 2, patients with advanced solid tumors and recurrent high-grade gliomas will be enrolled and administered BXQ-350 at the MTD determined in Part 1 or at the highest planned DL, if the MAD is not reached.

 Phase 1 Study of BXQ-350 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

The objective of this study is to characterize the safety profile and determine the maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of BXQ-350, when given as a single agent at escalating doses, according to the investigational product (IP) related dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 Secondarily to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BXQ-350 in solid tumors and recurrent high grade gliomas.
