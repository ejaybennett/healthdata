(fifthQuint)Overactive Bladder Treatment Using StimRouter Neuromodulation System: A Prospective Randomized Trial.

 Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in the Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) for Overactive Bladder study.

 After signing the informed consent and completing the screening visit, eligible candidates will be asked to (1) stop any OAB medications (including but not limited to anti-muscarinic medication or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) as well as stabilize dosage and frequency of any concomitant medications for 3 weeks, if applicable, and then (2) complete a daily Patient Voiding Diary for 7 days .

 Subjects will then return to the office for baseline review.

 If all screening and baseline criteria are met, the subject will be enrolled, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the "control group" or the "investigational group" and scheduled for implant with the StimRouter device.

 After approximately 3 weeks for healing post-implant, study participants will be programmed according to their randomization assignment.

 All subjects will be instructed to apply stimulation at least 3 days/week for at least 30 minutes/day (i.

e.

, the minimum protocol requirements for device use) for 6 months and to apply stimulation when they anticipate OAB events.

 Patient Voiding Diaries will be completed by the participants for 7 days prior to each follow-up visit and provided to the office at each follow-up visit.

 Follow-up visits will occur at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 5 and Month 6.

 Each follow-up visit will include the review of subject voiding diaries and the completion of other subject questionnaires for measuring OAB and quality of life assessments.

 Final follow-up evaluations for all subjects will occur at Month 6.

 Overactive Bladder Treatment Using StimRouter Neuromodulation System: A Prospective Randomized Trial@highlight

Approximately 15 Study Sites will participate over total 24 months.

 Study population will consist of adults age 22 or over, reporting overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for at least 3 months.

 Primary Study Objectives: 1.

 To assess efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation in improving OAB symptoms of urgency and frequency as measured by Patient Voiding Diary when targeting the posterior tibial nerve 2.

 To assess safety of the StimRouter therapy for the indication of OAB Secondary Study Objective: To evaluate efficacy of the StimRouter therapy in addressing urinary urge incontinence as measured by the Patient Voiding Diary Study Design is prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded Primary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the investigational and control groups in proportion of responders, where Responder is defined as having 50% improvement in average voiding frequency above the normal value of 8 (those returning to normal voiding based on 7-day average voids/leak episodes 50% improvement in average number of moderate to severe urgency episodes, at approximately three months after programming.

 Secondary Endpoint: Secondary endpoint will be the difference between the investigational and control groups in proportion of patients with reduction by half or more in urinary urge incontinence as measured by the average number of urge incontinence episodes per day.
