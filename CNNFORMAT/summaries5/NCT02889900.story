(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Cediranib in Combination With Olaparib in Patients With Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer.

 The study will recruit approximately 100 patients aged 18 years, with histologically proven diagnosis of platinum-resistant relapsed high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, and who do not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation.

 All patients should have recurrent platinum resistant disease.

 The receipt of prior antiangiogenic treatment (e.

g.

 bevacizumab) is optional.

 If used, it can be in the first line or recurrent setting.

 To be eligible to enter the study, all patients should have measurable disease (as assessed by the Investigator).

 There is no maximum duration for taking the study treatments (cediranib+olaparib).

 Patients should continue on study treatments until objective radiological disease progression, as defined by RECIST version 1.

1 guidelines, or they meet other discontinuation criteria.

 Following discontinuation of study treatment patients will be followed for disease progression (if they have not already progressed), survival and post-progression anti cancer therapies until the data cut-off for the final OS analysis, approximately 12 months after enrolment of the last patient.
