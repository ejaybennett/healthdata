(thirdQuint)Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics of Primaquine Enantiomers in Human Volunteers, Study 1.

 The primary objective of this project is to investigate the comparative tolerability, metabolism and pharmacokinetics of individual enantiomers of PQ in healthy human volunteers.

 The overall approach is as follows: in 36 healthy volunteers with documented normal G6PD activity, we will administer a single oral dose of RPQ, SPQ, or RSPQ.

 At various times after dosing, we will draw blood samples, in which we will record the plasma levels of the parent drugs, along with plasma and urinary metabolites.

 The comparative pharmacokinetics, tolerability and hematological effects of these two enantiomers and the racemate will be assessed.

 Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics of Primaquine Enantiomers in Human Volunteers, Study 1@highlight

To investigate the comparative tolerability, metabolism and pharmacokinetics of individual enantiomers of PQ in healthy human volunteers.

 The specific aim is the comparative evaluation of the metabolism, pharmacokinetic behavior, and tolerability of the isomers of PQ (RPQ and SPQ and the racemic mixture RSPQ) in normal healthy human volunteers.
