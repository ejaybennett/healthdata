(secondQuint)Sertraline in Addition to Standard of Care Treatment for Coccidioidomycosis.

 Sertraline has been demonstrated to have in-vitro activity against coccidioides, and in-vivo activity against cryptococcal meningitis in clinical trials.

 Disseminated and meningeal coccidiodes infections require lifelong treatment, have poor outcomes, and new treatment options are needed.

 In this study the investigators will determine safety and tolerability of adjunctive sertraline (grade 4-5 adverse reactions) compared to standard coccidioidomycosis therapy alone.
