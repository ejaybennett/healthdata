(fifthQuint)Virtual Peer-to-Peer (VP2P) Support Mentoring for Adolescents With Cancer.

 The aim of this project is to develop and examine the impact of a virtual peer support program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with cancer using a waitlist randomized controlled trial.

 In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that will provide modelling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 18-25 years who have learned to function successfully with their pain.

 Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions of 30-45 minute Skype calls over 8 weeks.

 Feasibility of the program will be measured in addition to quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy, social support, and self-management skills.

 Virtual Peer-to-Peer (VP2P) Support Mentoring for Adolescents With Cancer@highlight

The overall aim of this research program is to develop and examine the impact of a Cancer virtual peer-to-peer (VP2P) Support Program on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adolescents with cancer (AWC).

 In the current proposal, the feasibility of trialing the Skype-based VP2P program providing peer-support from mentors and the magnitude of program effect estimates will be evaluated in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT).

 This pilot RCT will enable us to refine the program and determine the appropriate sample size for a future large-scale RCT, which will compare the effectiveness of VP2P to a waitlist control group at a major Children's Oncology Group- affiliated centers in Canada and the United States.
