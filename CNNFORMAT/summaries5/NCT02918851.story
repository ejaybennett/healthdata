(fifthQuint)VO2 Max: In Vivo Model for Functional Red Cell Testing.

 Can RECESS be Explained?.

 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations permit additive-containing RBCs to be stored for up to 42 days prior to transfusion.

 However, RBCs progressively develop abnormalities during storage.

 The efficacy of older stored blood, i.

e.

, effective oxygen delivery, has not been established in rigorous controlled studies.

 Due to pragmatic reasons, a large clinical trial that randomizes patients to "old" blood may not be feasible.

 Every subject will have 2 phlebotomy visits at Stony Brook University Hospital.

 Subjects randomized to the 7- and 42-day old groups will have 2 units of blood removed at Week 0 and another 2 units removed at Week 5.

 However, the remaining 28-day group will have 2 units of blood removed at Week 2 and only 1 unit of blood removed at Week 5.

 During week 6, each subjects will have 3 study visits: 1) On Monday, a VO2 max test; 2) On Wednesday, a transfusion with 2 units of autologous RBCs (each over 1 hour), followed by a VO2 max test 2 hours later; 3) On Friday, a VO2 max test will be done in order to calculate a delta VO2 max (Friday minus Monday results).

 VO2 Max: In Vivo Model for Functional Red Cell Testing.

 Can RECESS be Explained?@highlight

This is a single-center, randomized, partially blinded study to determine whether 42-day old red blood cells (RBCs) deliver oxygen as effectively as 7-day old RBCs and also to determine whether transfusion with 28-day old RBCs is non-inferior to 7-day old RBCs with respect to oxygen delivery.

 In this study, subjects will be randomized to be transfused with 2 units of autologous (one's own) RBCs that are either 7-, 28-, or 42-days old.

 Endpoints include changes in exercise duration and VO2 max (test of oxygen consumption/delivery) between groups.
