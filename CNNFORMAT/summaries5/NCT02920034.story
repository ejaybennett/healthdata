(secondQuint)Randomized Comparison of Ultrasound Versus Radiofrequency Denervation in Patients With Therapy Resistant Hypertension.

 The aim of this trial is a prospective, randomized comparison of three different techniques for catheter based renal sympathetic denervation.

 Patients with larger (>5.

5 mm) renal arteries are randomized to a treatment with a radiofrequency based catheter of the main renal artery, the main renal artery, its side-branches and accessories or an ultrasound-based denervation of the main renal artery only.

 The primary endpoint is the change in daytime blood pressure acquired in ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 3 months.
