(thirdQuint)Focussed Echocardiography to Detect Preoperative Hypovolemia and Left Ventricular Dysfunction as a Predictor of Post-Induction Hypotension.

 Various haemodynamic parameters like central venous pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , systolic pulse pressure variations , stroke volume variation , pleth variability index etc are being used as markers of volume status and which in turn have been used as indicators of post general anesthesia induction hypotension in the past .

 In the current study the investigators aim to validate the role of a bed side 2-D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a guide to identify the volume status of the patient before induction and clinically observe for the haemodynamic changes in the form of mean arterial pressure variations in the immediate post induction period.

 The investigators aim to perform preoperative bed side Transthoracic echocardiography in 150 American society of Anesthesiologists grade-I/II patients posted for routine General anaesthesia procedures and assess their volume status .

 Then the investigators would collect 10 mean arterial pressure recordings at one minute interval in the immediate postinduction period and assess the accuracy of TTE in identifying potential patients at risk of developing post induction hypotension.

 Focussed Echocardiography to Detect Preoperative Hypovolemia and Left Ventricular Dysfunction as a Predictor of Post-Induction Hypotension@highlight

This is an observational study to evaluate the role of a Bed side Focus assessed Transthoracic Echocardiography (FATE) in identifying the patients at a potential risk of developing hypotension secondary to general anesthesia induction using the FATE parameters like velocity time integral ( VTI ), Inferior venacava diameter , Caval index and Left ventricular end end diastolic area.
