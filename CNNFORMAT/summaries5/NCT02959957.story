(secondQuint)Disturbance of the Intestinal Microbiota by Temocillin vs Cefotaxime in Treatment of Febrile Urinary Tract Infections.

 Temocillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against gram negative bacteria inclusive many ESBL producing bacteria.

 Temocillin is approved and marketed in a few European countries since the 1980s but not in Sweden.

 The aim of the study is to find an ecological favorable alternative to cephalosporins in the treatment of this common indication.

 The hypothesis is that treatment with temocillin causes less disturbances on the intestinal microbiota while at least comparable efficacy.

 The study will be performed as an open prospective multicentre study with two parallel groups comparing 2 g temocillin three times daily with 1-2 g cefotaxim three times daily for 7-10 days in male and female adult patients with febrile urinary tract infection.

This study will evaluate the ecological impact on the intestinal microbiota and compare the safety and efficacy of temocillin compared to cefotaxime, in empiric treatment of febrile UTI.

 Half of participants will receive temocillin and the other half will receive cefotaxime.
