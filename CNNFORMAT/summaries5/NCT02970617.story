 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To measure the severity of patients' memory of distress from cancer treatment.

 To assess the relationship between anxiety to actual distress and to remembered distress.

 III.

 To assess the relationship between optimism-pessimism personality to actual distress and to remembered distress.

 IV.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.
