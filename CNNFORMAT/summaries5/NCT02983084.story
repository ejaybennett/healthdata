(secondQuint)Orthodontic Archwire Comparison Trial.

 This is a randomized clinical trial utilizing multiforce and CuNiTi orthodontic archwires to align and level dental arches and compare their results.

 A three group double blind parallel single site study at IUSD will be used.

 Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from the IUSD orthodontic clinic.

 The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups by the study statistician.

 Subjects, examiners providing subject treatment, and examiners measuring study outcomes will be blinded to treatment assignment.

 Study population indicates a sample size of 105 subjects, each group containing 35 clinical subjects.

 Patients will be treated with Ormco Titanium Orthos fixed appliances and defined archwire sequence according to a clinical protocol.

 During the six-month study period, subjects will be seen approximately every 4 (four) weeks for regular standard of care appointments that will include archwire monitoring, photography and questionnaire completions.

 Final study records will be taken at the end of the study period.
