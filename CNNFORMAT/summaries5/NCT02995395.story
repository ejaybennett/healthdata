(secondQuint)Mucosal Impedance Balloon in Diagnosis and Treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).

 The standard diagnostic evaluation for EoE includes upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies.

 Recently we completed the study "Mucosal impedance in eosinophilic esophagitis and the effect of treatment" using a new technology allowing for direct assessment of mucosal impedance at the time of routine upper endoscopy to assess esophageal integrity and disease activity and alevate the need for biopsies.

 For this study, Sandhill Scientific has customized a Mucosal Impedance balloon (MI) assembly to provide precise measurements over a broad area of esophageal epithelium, while eliminating the fluids and spanning across a 10 mm luminal area using the same direct assessment as the mucosal impedance at the time of routine upper endoscopy.

This study will evaluate the role the balloon mucosal impedance may have in diagnosing and monitoring the patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

 We will compare the results of the balloon mucosal impedance in patients with Eosinophilic esophagitis and controls.
