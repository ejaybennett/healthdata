(firstQuint)Effects of a Pre-Workout Dietary Supplement on Training Adaptations.

 A number of nutritional strategies have been developed to optimize nutrient delivery prior to exercise.

 This includes providing carbohydrate and a number of ergogenic nutrients prior to, during and/or following exercise.

 As a result, a number of pre-workout supplements have been developed to increase energy availability, promote vasodilation and/or positively affect exercise capacity.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of ingesting a pre-workout dietary supplement during resistance training on training adaptations.
