 This study is an open-label, baseline-controlled, single-center study to measure the change in skin elasticity after combined radio frequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment.

 Forty-five adult females will undergo weekly treatments over a period of 8 weeks.

 Skin elasticity will be measured by a Cutometer(R) prior to beginning treatment, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment.

 Photographs will be taken prior to treatment, at week 4, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment.

 Patient discomfort/pain and satisfaction questionnaires will be completed before, during and after treatment.
