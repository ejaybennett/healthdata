(fifthQuint)Interstitial Cystitis: Examination of the Central Autonomic Network.

 This multi-site trial will recruit 3 groups of female subjects ages 18-80 years, evenly distributed across decades (10 or 20 per decade as appropriate): Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS), Myofascial Pelvic Pain (MPP) and Healthy Controls (HC).

 This proposal aims to move the science of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) from simple associations towards an investigation of cause and effect relationships.

 We will determine whether the striking changes in ANS-R contribute meaningfully to the pathogenesis of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome IC/BPS through 3 aims: 1.

 Careful longitudinal repeated measures in individual subjects to determine if ANS-R changes precede clinical changes; 2.

 Assessing the impact of an intervention designed to change ANS-R on the clinical course of IC/BPS; 3.

 Evaluating changes in brain connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) associated with changes in ANS-R and improved disease status.

 Subjects will be pre-screened in person or on the phone.

 An in-person pre-screen takes place in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at Froedtert Hospital.

 If the subject is able to participate, subject will sign the informed consent form before completing a baseline evaluation.

 The baseline evaluation occurs either following consent or at another date convenient for them.

 Subjects must complete all baseline activities within 2 weeks, or before their Week 4/Visit 2.

 The baseline evaluation is comprised of a general examination, a set of questionnaires, background history documenting date of diagnosis, medications tried, duration of each treatment and dosing, surgeries and therapeutic and exploratory procedures performed.

 A pelvic examination will be performed with CPP subjects patients only.

 Active Change in Posture (ACP) and Descending Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC, or "cold-water" test) are administered to the subject.

 Subjects will complete the uroflow (urine) measurement and Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present.

 Weekly Home Checks will occur for 24 weeks following consent.

 Once each a week, subjects will complete a 24-hour heart rate (HR) recording and the ACP recording using the eMotion Faros 360 portable EKG device.

 A member of the research team will contact the subject each week while they complete the weekly questionnaires and ACP recording.

 This will ensure compliance and will give the subject the opportunity to ask any questions.

The researcher will remain on the phone or via Skype to monitor the subject while the ACP recording is completed from home just prior to the subject's bedtime.

 The HR recording will be uploaded to MCW's secure server at the subject's next hospital visit.

 Throughout the study, subjects flare activity will be monitored via phone calls and recording flares in the EMA application on the smartphone.

 This will be a Daily Flare Question in the EMA which is a set alarmed time to sound as a reminder for the duration of the subject's participation.

 The following weeks after each site visit and the night before visit 5, subjects will repeat complete the 24-hr HR recording to ensure comparability of the HRV recording at home to the one performed at the matching on-site visit.

, Subjects will also complete the 24-h voiding diary, a set of questions using the ICECAN mobile App installed on a pre-loaded smartphone and questionnaires.

 Deidentified 24-hour HRV and ACP recordings will be sent to Ohio State University for analysis.

 Follow-up Visits: Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, Visits 2-5 Subjects will arrive to MCW Neurology Research Rooms to repeat the following: review of comorbidities, tender points exam, questionnaires, ACP and DNIC tests.

 Subjects will complete the Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present.

 Chronic Pelvic Pain patients subjects will complete a repeat pelvic examination at Weeks 12 and 24.

 MPP and IC/BPS patients subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either placebo (a pill with no active agent), or metoprolol (a pill that reduces the impact of the brain's "fight or flight" circuits).

 Metoprolol is in the class of "beta-blockers" commonly used for mild blood pressure control, and also commonly used for migraine.

 Subjects will be administered 8 weeks of metoprolol or placebo starting at their Week 4 Visit.

 Subjects will complete a 4-week washout period (Week 12-16) and will be administered 8 weeks of crossover (Weeks 16-24).

 Blood will be drawn (~ 50 mL, a little more than 3 tablespoons) at each in-person visit at weeks 0, 4, 12, 16, and 24 for chronic pelvic pain subjects (healthy control only at Baseline and Final visits; 2 draws total).

 A portion of the blood plasma/serum will be sent to the University of Pittsburgh for additional related analysis.

 The sample will be labeled by a number and will not contain any information that can be used to directly identify subject.

 This portion of the study is critical to gather new information about pelvic pain, which is very poorly understood and we highly encourage subjects to participate in this portion of the study; however, it is optional.

 Healthy Controls: 60 healthy control subjects will also complete this study in 24 weeks that include 4 long site visits and 6 weekly home check visits.

 During this first long visit they will complete a general exam and physician evaluation, DNIC, ACP, Valsalva maneuver, and questionnaires.

 Subjects will complete a 24-hour HR recording from home once a week for 6 weeks total.

 Interstitial Cystitis: Examination of the Central Autonomic Network@highlight

Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) afflicts 3 to 8 million women in the US.

 Symptoms of IC/BPS reduce quality of life, suppressing both social well-being and physical function.

 The chronic pain, voiding dysfunction, sleep deprivation and associated co-morbid conditions interfere with relationships and employment with significant direct (doctor visits, medication, surgery) and indirect (loss of productivity) economic impact, currently exceeding $100 million per year.

This proposal aims to move the science of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) from simple associations towards an investigation of cause and effect relationships.

 The investigators will determine whether the striking changes in autonomic nervous system responsiveness (ANS-R) contribute meaningfully to the pathogenesis of IC/BPS.
