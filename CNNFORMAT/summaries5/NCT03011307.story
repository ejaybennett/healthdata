(firstQuint)Efficacy of Intrathecal Oxytocin to Speed Recovery After Hip Surgery.

 This is a single-center, NIH funded clinical study at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

 The investigators anticipate that intrathecal oxytocin will speed recovery from pain after major surgery (hip arthroplasty).

 For this study, the investigators will use a randomized, controlled and blinded study of intrathecal oxytocin in patients scheduled for hip arthroplasty, with primary outcome being the slope of change in pain over the first 60 days following surgery, using growth curve modeling and a ln(time) function.
