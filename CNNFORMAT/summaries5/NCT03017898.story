(firstQuint)Treatment of Anal Fistula With Lasercoagulation.

 Treatment of anal fistula remains a challenge - the only truly effective treatment available (fistulotomy) involves very high rates of anal incontinence if performed on the majority of patients, and a vast number of alternative, sphincter-preserving treatments have been developed and evaluated in the past decades.

 The treatment of anal fistula with laser coagulation causes the fistula to collapse and subsequently heal, without having to add any external materials.

 The available published studies show that the treatment is safe regarding infection and incontinence, and that a majority of the patients treated show complete healing.

 There is however a need for more prospective studies to ascertain these preliminary facts.
