(thirdQuint)Serum Caspase 3, Annexin a2 and Soluble Fas Levels and Endometriosis.

 The participants will be accepted for the study between 1st of August 2016 to 30th June 2017.

 2 cc blood samples will be drawn from the antecubital vein for serum analysis of caspase 3, annexin a2 and soluble fas levels before the operations.

 The patients will divide into three groups.

 The group 1 will comprise of 30 patients with benign ovarian cysts such as mature teratoma or simple serous cysts on ultrasound examination.

 The group 2 will comprise of 30 patients with diagnosis of stage 1-2 endometriosis in guidance with the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification.

 The group 3 will comprise of 30 patients with diagnosis of stage 3-4 endometriosis in guidance with the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification.

 The blood samples will be kept in -80 C degree after centrifuge till at the end of the study.

The relation between serum caspase 3, annexin a2 and soluble fas levels and severity of endometriosis will be analysed.
