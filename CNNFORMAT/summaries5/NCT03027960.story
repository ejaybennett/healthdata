(thirdQuint)Empagliflozin in Heart Failure: Diuretic and Cardio-Renal Effects.

 Study Objectives 1.

 Study the acute/short term effect and cardio-renal mechanisms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition in patients with heart failure.

 2.

 Determine the effect of chronic combined SLLGT2 and loop diuretic exposure in patients with heart failure.

 Primary Outcomes 1.

 Aim 1 (Acute): Determine if acute SGLT2 inhibition will improve the natriuretic effect of a loop diuretic compared to placebo.

 2.

 Aim 2 (Chronic): Determine the effect of 14 days of SGLT2 inhibition on blood volume.

 Empagliflozin in Heart Failure: Diuretic and Cardio-Renal Effects@highlight

The investigators propose a small pilot proof of concept study to not only prove the existence of, but also probe the mechanisms underlying cardio-renal effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure.

 The investigators propose a 50 patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with patients with stable HF, type II diabetes and an eGFR >45ml/min/1.

73 m2 who are chronically receiving loop diuretics.
