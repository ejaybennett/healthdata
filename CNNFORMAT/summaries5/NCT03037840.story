(thirdQuint)Detecting Tumor Specific Amplitude-modulated Frequencies of Cancer Patients.

 The measurements were safety guaranteed and were conducted in hospital.

 Before detecting, the patient will be already diagnosed with cancer.

 The doctor and the operator are responsible for the detecting.

 When cancer patients are exposure to the RF electromagnetic fields, the radial pulse amplitude, blood pressure, skin electrical resistance and breath will be monitored.

 Biofeedback parameters will be recorded at different modulation frequencies and analyzed in order to find the variation and tumor specific frequencies.

 Detecting Tumor Specific Amplitude-modulated Frequencies of Cancer Patients@highlight

Studies have shown that tumor specific amplitude-modulated frequencies of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields that is associated with biofeedback upon exposure to in cancer patients.

 However, such discovery in other cancer patients are rare.

 And whether tumor specific frequencies can be found in Asian cancer patients remains unclear.

 The purpose of this study is to detect the tumor specific frequencies of Asian cancer patients in vivo.
