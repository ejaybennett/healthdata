(firstQuint)Corneal Confocal Microscopy in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes.

 Rationale: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with microvascular complications, which includes peripheral neuropathy.

 Peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes is a painful condition.

 Its diagnosis is hampered by painful and long nerve conduction studies which fail to diagnose small nerve neuropathy.

 It is important to study methods of noninvasive methods of early detection, which are sensitive and specific in diagnosing early neuropathy and we propose a novel study that this can be detected in the cornea of the eye.

 Aims: - Estimate corneal small nerve fiber damage in young T1DM subjects (corneal fiber density, nerve branch density, and fiber length) and compare the results to healthy controls using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).

 - Estimate corneal nerve fiber damage in subjects with diabetes, with peripheral neuropathy and subjects with diabetes without peripheral neuropathy, diagnosed by skin biopsies and nerve conduction studies - Obtain much needed normative values for CCM in adolescents and intraepidermal nerve fiber density from skin biopsies in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

 - As a secondary outcome measure, to compare serum biomarkers including leptin, TNF alpha, and fibrinogen in patients with diabetes in those with neuropathy Vs.

 without neuropathy.

 Hypothesis: 1.

 Subjects with T1DM will have reduced corneal nerve fiber density, corneal nerve branch density, and fiber length on Corneal Confocal Microscopy compared to controls and these findings will be more pronounced in those with neuropathy.

 2.

 There will be a correlation between abnormal corneal parameters and biomarkers.

 Adolescents with neuropathy diagnosed via nerve conduction studies will have the lowest nerve fiber density from the distal leg and this will correlate with nerve conduction studies.

 Study Design: Cross sectional study design, interventional Inclusion: Subjects with diabetes: 18-30 years (cohort 1), adolescents ages 13-17 years (cohort 2).

 Type 1 Diabetes diagnosed via standard ADA criteria Matched Controls: Match for age and gender Hemoglobin A1c <6.

5% Exclusion: For all subjects: Contact lens wearers Diseases that could damage the cornea, other than diabetes.

 Neurologic disease Psychiatric disease Amputation Foot ulcers Pain not of neuropathic origin.

 Presence of Lupus, Sjogren's syndrome and Celiac disease Hyperlipidemia requiring lipid-lowering medications Peripheral vascular disease Neuropathy due to anything besides diabetes Presence of any medical condition that may affect nerve conduction (e.

g.

, radiculopathy).

 For healthy controls Family history of Type 1 Diabetes The study will be under the monitoring of the Institutional Review Board of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Screening: The investigators will recruit 15 subjects 18-30, and then proceed with 35 13-17 year old subjects with T1DM, and in addition recruit matched controls.

 Subjects will be found via flyers placed around the hospital and via recruitment from clinics in the ophthalmology, neurology, and pediatric and adult diabetes clinics at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in Bronx, NY.

 In addition, the investigators will advertise for subjects through our local JDRF chapter.

 Healthy controls will be recruited from Craigslist and also from the Montefiore pediatric clinics.

 At the time of screening, subjects will be consented by Dr.

 Lisa Underland.

 The consent will be obtained in the clinical research center in an exam room with the door closed, and the study will be explained and subject will be given the opportunity to ask questions.

 Information will be obtained via discussion with the patient and also review of medical records (if followed at Montefiore) regarding current diabetes control (HgBA1c), lipid status, duration of disease, comorbidities, incidence of retinopathy (if available), and previous history of diabetes control.

 Study Visit: The investigators will initially recruit adult subjects first, and then assess for safety prior to inclusion of pediatric subjects.

 Subjects will present to the Ophthalmology clinic at Montefiore for the eye exam.

 They will undergo an examination via Corneal Confocal microscopy by Dr.

 Lisa Underland, who will be trained by Dr.

 Kang.

 The procedure itself will take less than 15 minutes, and will include use of a numbing drop prior to the procedure.

 The CCM device has disposable caps which will be used and changed between patients.

 Images will be reviewed and assessed by an ophthalmologist, and the same person will review all of the images for all subjects.

 This procedure is not standard of care at this time for this indication.

 In addition, subjects will receive evaluation by a neurologist to assess for neuropathy via physical examination and questioning using the Utah Early Neuropathy Scale and Michigan Neuropathy screening instrument[21].

 Nerve conduction studies will be obtained, and the skin biopsy portion performed on subjects with T1DM only.

 The 3mm skin punch biopsies will be taken from the distal leg and IENFD will be determined according to EFNS guidelines[9].

 These procedures are standard for the evaluation of a patient with suspected neuropathy, but not standard evaluation for all patients with Type 1 Diabetes.

 Blood will be obtained for biomarkers for Leptin, TNF alpha, and Fibrinogen.

 Data and Specimen Collection and Storage Data will be collected about diabetes control and management via chart review and at the time of screening.

 Paper charts will be stored in locked drawers in the division of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes, and any electronic files held on a password protected computer.

 Subjects will be identified by a unique study ID rather than by name in both data, and also on any biological specimens.

 Biological specimens will be stored in a freezer at -70 degrees.

 Data Safety and Monitoring An independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMB) will oversee this project and will conduct interim monitoring of accumulated data from research activities to assure the continuing safety of participants, relevance of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and accumulating data.

 The DSMB has been meeting and reviewing pediatric endocrinology research protocols that require it for several years.

 The monitoring entity consists of doctors with expertise in the relevant field of study, statistics and research design and will include Dr.

 Steven Choi, pediatric cardiologist at Montefiore, Dr.

 Rita Louard, adult endocrinologist at Montefiore, and Dr.

 Chhavi Agarwal, a private practice pediatric endocrinologist.

 The committee will meet prior to initiation of the protocol to review the plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance through evaluating the protocol and expertise of personnel performing the research procedures.

 Adverse events and protocol deviations will be reported annually at the DSMB meeting and serious adverse events and serious protocol deviations will be reported within 48 hours of occurrence.

 DSMB minutes and signed continuation forms will be submitted to the IRB with yearly progress reports and as needed for serious adverse events and deviations.

 The committee will meet annually to assess protocol compliance as well as prior to initiation of protocol and review safety information or in the case of a serious adverse event.

 Research would be suspended in the case a serious adverse event due to study activities that severely harms a subject as determined by the DSMB.

 Adverse events will be graded using severity scales consistent with common terminology criteria for adverse events.

 Safety information will be collected at the start and finish of all study visits and procedures by study personnel and if needed evaluation by a physician will be performed as is deemed appropriate.

 Information collected will include severity of adverse event, study intervention relationship, action taken, outcome, and if it was expected or serious.

 This will all be documented in the source documents and an adverse event log.
