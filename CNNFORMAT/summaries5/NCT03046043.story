(secondQuint)AF Ablation Based on High Density Voltage Mapping and CFAE.

 Fifty patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomized a 1:1 ratio to each group.

 A test group includes those who undergoing ablation targeting low voltage areas which contains complex fractionated trial electrogram in addition to pulmonary vein isolation and a control group includes who undergoing pulmonary vein isolation only.

 AF Ablation Based on High Density Voltage Mapping and CFAE@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of additional ablation targeting complex fractionated atrial electrogram area within low voltage zone identified by high resolution mapping in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.
