(thirdQuint)Manuka Honey in Second- and Grafted Third-degree Burns.

 In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment strategies of second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted third-degree burn wounds aim at reducing infection and improving reepithelialization.

 Although previous studies indicate that burn patients benefit from wound dressings containing manuka honey, only a few studies can be found.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate time to reepithelialization, pain, microbiology and handling of manuka honey dressings with second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted burn wounds.
