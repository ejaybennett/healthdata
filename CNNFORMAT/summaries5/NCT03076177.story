(fifthQuint)The Effectiveness of Kinesio Taping Method for Knee Osteoarthritis.

.

 After subject inclusion into research, two groups (study (kinesio taping) group and control-non specific taping) of 100 patients in each will be formed by the procedure of concealed randomization (person not connected with study by the help of random number generator will make allocation of subjects to the groups).

 All subjects will receive taping (kinesio or non specific) for one month (tapes will be applied once a week, 4 times per person, held on skin for 6 days with one day break - without tape).

 Subjects will be allowed to use their conventional analgesic medicaments 'per os' or parenterally if needed.

 Control and Kinesio taping applications will be done by certified kinesio taping practitioner (CKTP) or other team member trained by CKTP (researcher 'B').

 Other research team member (researcher 'A') will do evaluations of chosen criteria (pain, knee function, mobility etc.

), he will not be informed to which group (kinesio taping or placebo) subject was allocated, the same researcher (researcher 'A') will do repeated evaluations for the same subject after first and second months of participation in study.

 Taping applications: Control.

 For non specific taping Kinesio Tape tex Gold finger print (FP) will be used, however tapes will be applied without using specific application manner of kinesio taping method.

 I.

e.

 - tapes will be applied in subject lying position with knee fully extended using 0% of available tension 10 cm above and 10cm below superior and inferior poles of patella (approx 5x25cm) and on medial and lateral sides of knee joint (small pieces of tape approx.

 5x5cm) Kinesio taping.

 Kinesio Tape tex Gold FP will be used .

 Subjects will get two Y strips applied in lymphatic correction manner using paper off tension (tapes will be applied in fully flexed knee position); than two I strips will be applied for patella tendon and lateral and medial collateral ligaments using 75-100% of tension: over patella tendon - in fully flexed knee position, 100% of tension; over ligaments - in 20-30 degrees of knee flexion,75% of tension ; ends -with no tension, - seeking to increase stimulation of mechanoreceptors over the area, improve proprioception and reduce pain.

 All subjects, before starting the research, will be informed in written as well as in spoken form about the research, it's type, goals, possible inconveniences (possible skin irritation, hair picking etc.

).

 Every subject will have right to stop their participation in research at any time.

 The Effectiveness of Kinesio Taping Method for Knee Osteoarthritis.

@highlight

Purpose of our study is to evaluate effectiveness of Kinesio Taping method for knee osteoarthritis.

 Using simple concealed randomization procedure to form two groups (kinesio taping and control-nonspecific taping) of 100 knee osteoarthritis patients in each.

 1 month all patients (depending on the group they will be allocated to) will receive either kinesio taping applications or non-specific taping: 4 applications per subject.

 Three times: before taping, after a month with tapes, and after 1 month without tapes evaluation of knee function, mobility, quality of life will be evaluated, including clinical examination of knee joint, measurements of knee flexion and extension by goniometer, circumference of leg over the knee, in 1/2 of thigh and in 1/2 of calf (to evaluate edema); pain will be evaluated by questionnaire, patella tendon algometry; force of calf flexors and extensors will be evaluated using Lovett manual muscle testing scale, goniometry for knee flexion/extension; for mobility, knee function, life quality evaluations - 10 Meter Walk , Five Times Sit to Stand Tests will be performed, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 2 version (SF-36 2v) questionnaires will be used.

 Also data about the need of analgesic medicament will be collected from subjects.
