(fifthQuint)Prone Positioning During High Flow Oxygen Therapy in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure.

 Background Nasal high flow oxygen (NHF) is a new and promising tool for oxygen therapy in critically ill patients: NHF allows accurate delivery of the set FiO2, anatomical dead space clearance due to a washout effect in the upper airways and provides a small, variable amount of positive end end-expiratory pressure.

 Different studies have investigated its safety and efficacy in several clinical setting and, recently, a randomized controlled trial showed that NHF, as compared to NIV, may reduce the intubation rate in severely hypoxemic patients with de novo acute respiratory failure (AHRF).

 Prone positioning (PP) is a simple and cost-effective strategy that since 1980s has been used in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure to treat oxygenation impairment.

 In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) PP reduces intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and enhances lung recruitment, modifying both lung ventilation (VA) and lung perfusion (Q) distribution, finally generating an improvement in VA/Q matching and reversing oxygenation impairment.

 In addition, the reduction of transpulmonary gradient (mean pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) due to a higher pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure allows pulmonary vascular recruitment, possibly lowering dead space fraction.

 Indeed, prone positioning sessions have been shown to reduce right ventricular afterload, increase cardiac index in subjects with preload reserve and reverse acute cor pulmonale in severe ARDS patients.

 Finally, a large randomized study detected a relevant survival benefit by prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and managed with the ARDS network peep-FiO2 table strategy.

 Theoretically, PP benefits may concern also spontaneous breathing patients, in whom it could possibly contribute to the success of the noninvasive strategy.

 Data concerning PP application in such context are limited to small case series and a retrospective study involving patients undergoing NIV or oxygen therapy and suggesting good patients tolerance, significant improvement in oxygenation during the procedure and no increase in nurse workload.

 In particular, in the retrospective study by Pesenti and co.

 43 procedures in 15 patients were analysed: three patients (20%) received mild sedation without dosing adjustments over the course of the study, median [IqR] duration of prone positioning was 3[2-4] hours and only in two cases (5%) pronation had to be interrupted after 30 minutes due to patient's discomfort, while no other respiratory or technical complications, such as displacement of indwelling catheters, facial oedema, pressure sores, pressure neuropathies, compression of nerves, and retinal vessels or vomiting, have been documented.

 Given its high tolerability, simplicity to use and positive effect on patients' comfort when compared both to NIV and to low flow oxygen delivered through a face mask, NHF may be the optimal strategy for the respiratory management of spontaneous breathing patients during prone positioning.

 Interestingly, a recent electrical impedance tomography study on 20 healthy volunteers during NHF showed a more homogeneous dorsal-to-ventral ventilation pattern in PP, as compared to the supine position: notably, a dorsal-to-ventral more uniform air distribution may benefit hypoxemic patients, given that PaO2 response to oxygen supplementation can be fostered by more homogeneous regional lung inflation and better oxygenation has been shown to be a predictor of NHF treatment success.

 The investigators designed a pilot feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of prone positioning in patients wit AHRF undergoing high flow oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

 Methods: Setting: 21-bed medical-surgical ICU, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario "Agostino Gemelli", Rome, Italy.

 Patients: adult hypoxemic (PaO2/FiO2 40 bpm will be excluded for safety reasons.

 Protocol Eligible patients will undergo NHF for 1 hour in the supine semi recumbent position (baseline, BL step).

 Oxygen therapy will be commenced at 60 l/min and flows will be decreased in case of intolerance.

 Humidification chamber (MR860, Fisher and Paykel healthcare) will be set at 37 C or 31 C according to patient's comfort.

 FiO2 will be titrated to obtain and SpO2 >92 % and 120 BPM) - Displacement of venous line (peripheral or central), if documented - Displacement of arterial line, if documented - Displacement of urinary catheter, if documented.

 At the end of the study, the nurse in charge will be asked to anonymously rate the additional workload due to PP (in minutes) and to judge the feasibility and safety of the procedure using two analog scales ranging from 0 (completely unfeasible/unsafe) to 10 (totally feasible/safe).

 Sample size Given the pilot, physiological and exploratory design of the study, a formal sample power analysis was not performed.

 It is planned to enrol 15 patients over a period of 12 months.

 Prone Positioning During High Flow Oxygen Therapy in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure@highlight

Background High-flow nasal cannula (NHF) are a promising tool for administering oxygen to critically ill patients with high respiratory demand.

 Prone positioning (PP) is a simple and cost-effective strategy that since 1980s has been used in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure to treat oxygenation impairment.

 A large randomized study detected a relevant survival benefit by prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and managed with the ARDS network PEEP-FiO2 table strategy.

 Theoretically, PP may benefit spontaneous breathing patients too, but data concerning its application in such context are limited to small case series and a retrospective study.

 The investigators designed a pilot feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of prone positioning in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure patients noninvasively treated with NHF.

 Methods Patients: 15 adult hypoxemic (PaO2/FiO2<300 mmHg) non-hypercapnic patients with acute respiratory failure.

 Protocol Eligible patients will undergo NHF during a 1-hour monitoring window in the supine semi recumbent position (baseline, BL).

 After 1 hour of NHF in the supine semi recumbent position, an ABG and a monitoring visit will be performed to confirm the presence of the inclusion and the absence of exclusion criteria.

 Afterwards, each enrolled patient will be placed in the prone position for 2 hours.

 After a 2-hour PP period, the patient will be rotated and will undergo 2 hours of NHF in the semi recumbent supine position (Supine step).

 Measurements Patient's demographics will be collected at study entry.

 At the end of the monitoring period, and then on a hourly basis the following data will be collected: - Respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaO2/FiO2; - Heart Rate, arterial blood pressure; - Dyspnoea, as defined by the Borg dyspnoea scale; - Discomfort, as defined by a visual analogic scale (VAS) adapted to rate the procedural pain of ICU patients; - End expiratory lung impedance (EELI), tidal volume distribution, global and regional lung dynamic strain (Change in lung impedence due to tidal volume/ELLI).

 The number of adverse events will be also recorded for each study step.
