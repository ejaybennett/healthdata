(secondQuint)Non-cardiac Chest Pain: Effect of Cognitive Therapy Administered as Guided Self-help.

 Most patients with chest pain referred to hospital do not have a cardiac illness.

 Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is often followed by persistent distress and reduced quality of life, and societal costs are nearly equal to those of cardiac patients.

 Research suggests that face-to-face CBT is effective, but this has not been implemented as standard treatment.

 We plan to test an easily implementable web-based guided self-help intervention for NCCP patients.

 Patients will be recruited at the chest pain unit at Sorlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, and will be recruited after they have finished their cardiac examination.

 The intervention group will receive six web-based sessions, comprising information, exposure to physical activity, how worry can excess pain, physical reactions to pain and worry, consequences of avoidance, and specific panic treatment.

This study aims to test an easily implementable web-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) self-help intervention designed for non-cardiac chest pain patients, and compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to treatment as usual in an randomized controlled trial (RCT).
