(thirdQuint)A Multiple Ascending Dose Study of PUL-042 in Stem Cell Transplant Recipients.

 This is an open-label multiple ascending dose study with a 3+3 study design to examine the safety and tolerability of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution in subjects with hematologic malignancies or recipients of a first allogenic or autologus hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

 Subjects will receive 4 doses over 2 weeks.

 Cohort size will be 3 subjects, once 3 subjects have completed treatment and follow-up at a dose level, subject data will be evaluated by an independent data safety monitoring committee prior to dosing additional subjects.

 The Committee may recommend increasing the dose, maintaining the same dose, or decreasing the dose.

 Once the maximum dose is determined, there may be up to 6 additional subjects dosed at that level.
