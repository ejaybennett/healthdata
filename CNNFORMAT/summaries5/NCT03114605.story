(thirdQuint)Mindfulness-based Intervention in Police Officers - the POLICE Study.

 Police officers are submitted to a high burden of chronic stress.

 It is no surprise to find that this occupation ranks highest on diseases and accidents rates among all professions.

 These professionals presents a very high incidence of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence and suicidal behavior.

 In addition to mental health suffering, evidence suggests an increase risk of sudden cardiac death, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.

 Mindfulness-based interventions have been tested and incorporated for several clinical and non-clinical conditions for more than three decades, with emphasis on stress reduction, promotion of quality of life, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and eating disorders.

 The main hypothesis is that mindfulness training will improve their quality of life and reduce burnout symptoms.

 The investigators expect that individuals allocated in the MBI group will report, besides showing a better quality of life, mental health and less burnout, lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression symptoms.

 With regard to the working mechanism of the MBI, investigators will examine if the changes in mindfulness trait, self-compassion, spirituality, decentering and resilience skills will mediate the main hypothesis.

 The study will be conducted in Porto Alegre-RS and Sao Paulo-SP.
