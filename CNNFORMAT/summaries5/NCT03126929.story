(secondQuint)Further Psychometric Data for the Reliability and the Diagnostic Validity of CRS-R.

 Recently, a report of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine aiming to provide a systematic review of behavioral assessment scales for DOC has indicated that, when compared to other scales, the CRS-R meets the highest psychometric standards for the evaluation of severely brain-injured patients and may be used to assess DOC with minor reservations.

 However, that report mentions few evidences or studies with small sample sizes for some aspects of its reliability and validity such as its internal consistency and its test-retest reliability.

The report also states that the diagnostic validity of the CRS-R remains unproven.

 In this study, the investigators will therefore aim to provide further psychometric data as regards those variables in a large sample of patients with DOC.

This study aims to provide, in a large sample, further psychometric data as regards the internal consistency, the test-retest reliability and the diagnostic validity of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).
