(secondQuint)Single Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Pharmacokinetics as Well as Safety and Tolerability of a Concomitant Administration of Nifedipne GITS and Candesartan Tablets Under Fasting Conditions in Healthy Male Subjects in an Open Label, Non-randomized, Sequential Design.

.

 - Treatment period 1: Single oral dose of 30 mg nifedipine GITS and 8 mg candesartan as loose combination (Treatment A) - Treatment period 2: Single oral dose of 60 mg nifedipine GITS and 16 mg candesartan as loose combination (Treatment B) - Treatment period 3: single oral dose of 60 mg nifedipine GITS and 32 mg candesartan as loose combination (Treatment C) Before any study drug administration in each treatment period, subjects were fasted from food for at least 10 hours.

 Subjects continued fasting until at least 4 hours after study drug administration.

 The wash-out phase between treatments was 5 days.

 The blood collection period for pharmacokinetics after administration was 48 h.

 Afterwards, subjects were discharged from the ward.

 A safety follow-up visit was performed approximately 7 days after the last administration.
