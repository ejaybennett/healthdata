(firstQuint)Measurement of MSFP and Stressed Volume With CardioQ+.

 In this study the oesophageal Doppler monitor (CardioQ+), arterial pulse wave analysis (via the CardioQ+ and Flotrac device) and central venous pressure (CVP) will be used to estimate mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) with the inspiratory hold method.

 Furthermore the MSFParm will be determined using a rapid cuff inflator.

 From MSFP vascular compliance (Csys) and stressed volume (Vs) will be calculated.

 The accuracy of Vs to follow a 500 increase in volume will be studied.

 The accuracy of MSFP and Vs to to predict fluid loading responsiveness will be assessed in 42 patients after elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

 The effect of a standardised fluid loading on parameters of intrinsic contractility and afterload will be determined.

 The effect of fluid loading on inertia, resistance and elastance will be assessed.
