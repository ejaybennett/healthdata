(thirdQuint)Study of PD-1 Activated CIK Armed With Bispecific Antibody for Advanced Liver Cancer.

 Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in our country, ranking fourth in all malignant tumors and third in mortality.

Immunetherapy is considered to be one of the most promising means of human against cancer.

 This is a phase II clinical trial of single-center, randomized (1:1of targeted activation CIK and traditional CIK therapy )comparison clinical trial of PD-1 inhabitor activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced liver cancer.

 The investigators plan to recruit for 30 pairs of (60 cases) patients with advanced liver cancer, one of the two group will receive treatment of activated CIK,and the other receive mixed liquor of activated CIK and anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody.

 The result of this study was statistic and analysed with the record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.

1) evaluation standard.
