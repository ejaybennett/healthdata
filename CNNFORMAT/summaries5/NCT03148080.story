(firstQuint)Work Ability in Young Adult Survivors.

 This observational, cross-sectional study will recruit 200 YA survivors through the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (WF NCORP RB).

 Data will be collected using a web-based interface and will capture physical, psychosocial and cognitive late effects; work ability; work-related outcomes, including labor force participation, occupation, work place characteristics, and educational attainment; survivor characteristics; and cancer diagnosis/treatment information (from clinical records).

 We will evaluate the relationships among these measures using the theoretical framework to guide statistical analysis.
