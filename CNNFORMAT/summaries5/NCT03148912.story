(secondQuint)Optimizing the Diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia.

 The proposed is a prospective cohort study exploring a novel diagnostic approach to Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) using a combination of pretest probability assessment and quantitative interpretation of the anti-platelet factor 4 Immunological assay (anti-PF4).

 Patient with a clinical suspicion of HIT will follow the study diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1).

 The study algorithm will be considered a safe approach to move forward into a larger RCT if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 'false negative management failures' is 4% based on a Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) gold standard.

 The main objective of the pilot study is to inform feasibility and recruitment barriers for a larger randomized control trial.
