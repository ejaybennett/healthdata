(secondQuint)MANUAL MOBILIZATION IN CERVICAL DISORDES.

 The clinical practice guidelines for manual therapy management the neck pain including the spine mobilization.

 The vertebral resonant oscillation using the POLD method is similar to spine mobilizations, but there are some differens; the oscillatory movement has a sinusoidal waveform, the frequency used between 1.

2 and 2 Hz and the amplitude is similar to "neutral zone" to described by Panjabi 1992.

 The spinal mobilizations has a posterior-anterior vertebral movement for spinous process, described by Maitland 2000.

 MANUAL MOBILIZATION IN CERVICAL DISORDES@highlight

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of spinal mobilization versus vertebral resonant oscillation (POLD) in patients with bilateral mechanical neck pain on pain sensitivity and neck pain intensity.
