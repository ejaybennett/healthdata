(secondQuint)Study to Check the Efficacy and Safety of Recombinant BCG Vaccine in Prevention of TB Recurrence in India.

 The study is designed as a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two groups of category 1 pulmonary TB patients who have successfully completed ATT and declared cured by bacteriological confirmation.

 The eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive single dose of either VPM1002 or placebo.

 After study vaccination, participants will be followed up for one year.

 Any suspected TB case during follow up will be further evaluated and bacteriologically confirmed.

 Study participants will be actively followed up for 2 months post-vaccination for any solicited local and regional reaction.

 SAEs will be recorded and reported throughout study participation.
