(fifthQuint)Comparing the Outcomes of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy vs.

 Robotic Cholecystectomy.

 Laparoscopic approach is largely used for cholecystectomy surgery.

 Here, at UIC, however the investigators perform many surgeries of the gallbladder through robotic approach.

 However, the investigators do also perform this surgery using the laparoscopic approach at UIC.

 Laparoscopic and robotic surgery represent both minimally invasive approach and are associated with less pain, faster recovery and better cosmetic outcomes when compared to traditional open surgery.

 The majority of cholecystectomies in USA are still being done with laparoscopic approach though.

 However, the number of centers switching to the more technologically advanced robotic approach is growing exponentially.

 A recent paper has been published indicating that the robotic approach may decrease the rate of open conversion (traditional, open abdomen surgery) in cholecystectomy operations in comparison to laparoscopic approach1.

 Open conversion implies removal of the minimally invasive instruments (straight for laparoscopy and robotic with Endowrist(R) feature) from the patient's abdominal cavity and the creation of a large incision that starts in the midline, 2-5 cm below the xiphoid bone, extending in parallel with the costal margin for about 20 cm and going toward the right flank.

 There is sparse literature comparing outcomes of cholecystectomy between the laparoscopic and robotic approaches and no other major studies that focus on just this procedure.

 The investigators have already investigated the outcomes of robotic gallbladder surgery vs.

 laparoscopic surgery and published these data in a retrospective study, however the investigators are unsure if a prospective study would yield similar results.

 Specific Aim: The investigators would like to start a prospective randomized study to achieve definitive scientific evidence that will help determine which minimally invasive surgical approach is associated with the best outcomes when performing the removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy): laparoscopic or robotic?.

 Robotic Cholecystectomy@highlight

This research is being done to examine which minimally invasive surgical approach is associated with the best outcomes when performing cholecystectomy surgery: laparoscopic or robotic? Laparoscopic and robotic approaches are similar surgical procedures using small incisions.

 The laparoscopic approach is largely used for the removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).

 At UIC, the investigators perform the majority of the gallbladder surgeries through the robotic approach and only a few using the laparoscopic approach.

 The robotic surgical tools allows the surgeon the same freedom of movement as a human wrist, while using a 3D camera view.

 The laparoscopic and robotic surgical approaches both represent minimally invasive surgery approach and are associated with less pain, faster recovery and better cosmetic outcomes when compared to traditional open surgery.

 It is not currently known which approach is better.
