(thirdQuint)Electrolysis Technique vs Manual Therapy in Pelvic Pain.

 Dyspareunia is painful sexual intercourse and causes could be related to musculoskeletal pelvic floor muscles disorders (tenderness, trigger points, scars).

 There is evidence that manual therapy and intratissue percutaneous electrolysis can be effective for musculoskeletal pain disorders affecting muscles, tendons and fascias of the extremities but they have not been evaluated in pelvic floor muscle pain syndrome.

 The aim of this study is to compare manual therapy and EPI in the treatment of pelvic pain in women with dyspareunia.

 Pelvic floor manual therapy is a clinical approach utilizing specifics hands-on mobilizing techniques to treat soft tissues.

 Pelvic floor mobilization is a slow controlled process of soft-tissue (myofascial) stretching intended to improve bio-mechanical elasticity.

 EPI technique consists in an ultrasound-guided application of a galvanic electrolytic current that causes a controlled local inflammatory process in the target tissue.

 This allows for phagocytosis and the subsequent regeneration of the affected tissue.

 Electrolysis Technique vs Manual Therapy in Pelvic Pain@highlight

Pelvic floor muscle physical therapy is recommended in clinical guidelines for women dyspareunia and pelvic pain.

 This study compare pelvic floor manual therapy and intratissue percutaneous electrolysis (EPI) technique in the treatment of pelvic pain in women with dyspareunia.

 Half of participants will receive pelvic floor manual therapy while the other half will receive intratissue percutaneous electrolysis technique.
