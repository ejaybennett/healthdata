(firstQuint)Changes in Bile Acid Homeostasis and Stool Habits After Cholecystectomy.

 Lack of FGF19 and elevated 7-alpha-hydroxy-colestenone (C4) is associated with the bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), a disease with increasing estimated of prevalence.

 BAD is occasionally triggered by cholecystectomy and FGF19 and C4 is known to be affected by cholecystectomy.

 The investigators are exploring if FGF19 after oral stimulation can be developed to a universal test for BAD, and need to know how the proposed test is affected by cholecystectomy.
