(fifthQuint)Corazon de la Familia (Heart of the Family).

 The Corazon de la Familia study is a randomized controlled trial conducted to examine if a novel family-focused lifestyle modification intervention is more effective in reducing risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) than an individual-focused lifestyle modification intervention.

 We will enroll 220 Hispanic family pairs or dyads, of whom one member has two or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes or CVD but does not have type 2 diabetes or CVD.

 The second member of the family dyad may or may not have type 2 diabetes or CVD or may or may not be at risk for type 2 diabetes or CVD.

 Of the 220 family dyads, 110 will be randomly selected to participate in the family-focused intervention and 110 will be randomly selected to participate in the individual-focused intervention.

 The interventions for both groups will be provided by community health workers.

 Both groups will receive eight educational sessions about healthy lifestyle behaviors and support to address personal and environmental barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors.

 After the eight sessions, the community health workers will follow up with participants once a month by phone over the next 12 months.

 Primary outcomes include short-term and long-term impact of the family-focused active intervention compared to the individual-focused control condition on type 2 diabetes and CVD biological risk factors (for example, blood pressure and weight) and behavioral risk factors (for example, physical activity and tobacco use).

 Outcomes are measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at the end of the 12 month period of the study for both groups.

The Corazon de la Familia study is a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a novel family-focused lifestyle modification intervention to reduce risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Hispanics/Latinos.

 Facilitated by community health workers, the family-focused intervention engages two members of a family in an educational program addressing lifestyle behaviors to support sustained engagement in healthy lifestyles among Hispanics with high risk for type 2 diabetes or CVD.

 In this study, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term impact of the family-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition on biological and behavioral type 2 diabetes and CVD risk factors.

 Furthermore, we will examine outcomes of participants in the family-focused intervention to determine how each family member's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for the other family member's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner's outcomes.
