(fifthQuint)Stroke Volume Variation vs Central Venous Pressure Guidance Fluid Management in Endovascular Aortic Repair.

 Objective: To compare postoperative clinical outcome in adult patient undergoing EVAR.

 Primary outcome: Postoperative serum lactate and creatinine.

 Secondary outcome: Postoperative complications.

 Methods: Eligible patients will be randomized to 2 groups.

 Both groups will be managed intraoperatively in the same way, except fluid management protocol.

 SVV group will be managed according to stroke volume variation (SVV) protocol, i.

e.

, control SVV 10-13% and give fluid when SVV > 13%.

 CVP group will be managed using central venous pressure (CVP) protocol, i.

e.

, control CVP 8-12 mmHg and give fluid when CVP < 8 mmHg.

 Outcome analyses: Postoperative serum lactate and creatinine of both groups will be compared using unpaired Student-t test.

 Secondary outcomes will be compared using chi-square test.

 Stroke Volume Variation vs Central Venous Pressure Guidance Fluid Management in Endovascular Aortic Repair@highlight

Hypothesis: Fluid management guided by stroke volume variation (SVV), compared with central venous pressure (CVP), guidance results in better clinical outcomes.

 Primary outcomes: Perioperative, up to 48 h postoperative, serum lactate and creatinine level.

 Methods: Adult patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) will be randomized into 2 groups: SVV group managed by SVV guidance and CVP group managed by CVP guidance.

 Outcome analyses: Compare serum lactate, creatinine as well as other postoperative complications between both groups.
