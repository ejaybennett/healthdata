(secondQuint)SBRT + PD-1/PDL-1 Inhibiting Therapy for Advanced Solid Tumors After Progression on PD-1/PDL-1 Tx.

 SRT will be delivered in 3 to 5 treatment fractions over 1 to 2 weeks.

 Patients will continue to receive the same FDA-approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor that they had been receiving at the time of disease progression until 52 weeks following completion of SRT.

 Correlative blood samples will be collected at baseline, prior to the second SRT fraction, after the last SRT fraction (on the same day), and at 8, 24, and 52 weeks after the last SRT fraction.

 These samples will be used to determine the mechanistic immunologic effects of therapy.

To determine if SRT and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting therapy can restore the benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting therapy in patients with an advanced solid tumor who had clinical benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting therapy prior to progression.
