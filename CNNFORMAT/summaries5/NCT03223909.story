(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety of the Ophthalmic Solution PRO-087 Versus Systane  Ultra and Ultra Preservative Free (087LATAMFIV).

 Design Controlled, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy parameters between a group of subjects with a diagnose of mild to moderate tear film dysfunction syndrome under a regimen of ophthalmic solution lubricant drops PRO-087 versus subject under Systane(R) Ultra or Systane(R) Ultra preservative free, with the same diagnosis, with a follow-up of 90 days MAIN OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of preservative-free ophthalmic formulation PRO-087 (by Laboratorios Sophia, S.

) on the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, intraocular pressure, and structures of anterior and posterior segment in patients with tear film dysfunction syndrome from mild to moderate.

 To determine the correlation between improvement of clinical status and perceived improvement of symptoms of each participant in each study group.

 To compare the qualitative and quantitative histological status of the ocular surface before and after the pharmacological intervention in each study group to determine the evolution under the intervention of PRO-087.

 To evaluate the quantitative rating of tear film production by the Schirmer Test throughout the study.

 To qualitatively assess the tear film production by measuring the tear film break-up time stained with fluorescein and cobalt filter.

 Blinding: The double-blind study is a procedure in which the patient and the treating doctor ignore to which intervention group the study patient was assigned.

 To achieve the blinding of both the drug in research and both comparator drugs, these will be labeled in the same way (masking).

 Besides the figure of an unblinded pharmacist, who is responsible for the delivery of the medication to the patient, will be added.

 Blinding codes are protected by an outsider appointed by the study sponsor.

 The codes are also available in the research center (fully sealed), so that they can be consulted by the investigator in case a subject presents a serious adverse event, prior authorization from the study sponsor; the blinding also continues rigorous during the data analysis and interpretation.

 288 patients with tear film dysfunction, classified as mild to moderate, will be included and randomized into 3 groups; the first being treated with PRO-087 ophthalmic solution, the second with Systane(R) Ultra ophthalmic solution, and the third with ophthalmic solution Systane(R) Ultra preservative free.

 Pharmacological Intervention The pharmacological intervention will be the instillation of the ophthalmic solution in the bottom of the conjunctival sac during the waking period, in any of the following study groups: 1.

 Preservative free PRO-087 ophthalmic solution.

 Dropper bottle.

 Multidose 1 drop every 4 hours for 90 days.

 2.

 Systane(R) Ultra ophthalmic solution.

 Dropper bottle.

 Multidose.

 1 drop every 4 hours for 90 days.

 3.

 Systane (R) Ultra preservative free ophthalmic solution.

 Single-use vials.

 1 drop every 4 hours for 90 days.
