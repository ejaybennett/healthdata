(firstQuint)The Effect of Yoga on Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation Evaluated by I-123 mIBG.

 Subjects with reduced ejection fraction will be randomized to 8 weeks Yoga training (1 in class session and home practice) vs.

 no Yoga.

 They will undergo holter monitoring, cardiac device interrogation, and I-123 mIBG imaging at the beginning and end of the study.
