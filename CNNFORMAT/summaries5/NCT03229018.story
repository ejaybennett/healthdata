(firstQuint)Effect of Different Voxel Sizes on Accuracy of CBCT Linear Measurements: Preclinical Study.

 The real linear measurement will be measured in millimeter (mm) on the mandibles using digital caliper in the chosen areas.

 CBCT images will be viewed by OnDemand3D cent viewer software and linear measurements using 2D ruler on multiplanar slices and 3D ruler on 3D volumetric rendering to assess for the dimension in the chosen areas.
