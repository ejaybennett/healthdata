(secondQuint)Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure for Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Twins Infants.

 Invasive ventilation is related to development of adverse pulmonary and nonpulmonary outcomes in ventilated infants.

 Various modes of noninvasive respiratory support are being increasingly used to minimize the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

 The aim of this trial to compare the effects of bi-level positive airway pressure(BiPAP) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm twins infants as the primary mode.

The investigators compared advantages and disadvantages of two forms of noninvasive respiratory support -bi-level positive airway pressure(BiPAP) or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) -as a primary mode of ventilation in preterm twins infants with respiratory distress syndrome
