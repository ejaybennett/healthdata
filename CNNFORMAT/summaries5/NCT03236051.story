(thirdQuint)Multimodal Analgesia in Laparoscopic Radical Gastrectomy With Gastric Cancer: a Multi-center Study.

 Postoperative pain attracts the attention of surgeons, and optimal postoperative pain management contributes to reducing complications and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.

 Traditionally, the opioids were used for postoperative pain control.

 However, the opioids may increase the time to recover bowel function and lead to postoperative ileus.

 Multimodal analgesia is recommended in recent years, but studies on multimodal analgesia after gastrectomy are scarce.

 In this study, we introduced a multimodal analgesia strategy consisting of incision infiltration with ropivacaine, intravenous injection of parecoxib, and oral administration of an oxycodone/paracetamol mixture and evaluated the effects of this strategy compared with PCIA analgesia which is used widely for pain after gastrectomy.

The study is aimed to explore the effects of multimodal analgesia consisting of ropivacaine's wound infiltration, parecoxib's intravenous injection and oxycodone-acetaminophen tablets' oral administration on postoperative pain and rehabilitation after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for patients with gastric cancer.
