(thirdQuint)Pediatric Urology Recovery After Surgery Endeavor (PURSUE).

 The purpose of this project is to evaluate Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in the pediatric setting for participants undergoing intraabdominal urologic reconstruction procedures.

 ERAS practices are being implemented in the department independent of research and this project will allow the investigators to review these practices.

 Providers, participants, and family members will complete pre- and post- surgery questionnaires.

 These questionnaires are geared to collect demographic information about the participant and how the surgery affects their life situation.

 The providers will answer questions regarding their experience with ERAS.

 Evidence-based ERAS principles and procedures are compulsory components of this project.

 These will be documented in the medical record and are considered standard of care practice as part of perioperative patient care.

 Data collected from the medical record for each participant will aid in evaluating if adherence to the ERAS protocol is achieved.

 Pediatric Urology Recovery After Surgery Endeavor (PURSUE)@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol in children and young adults undergoing urologic reconstructive surgery.

 The investigators plan to collect data on speed of recovery (how quickly pain improves, length of time in the hospital, and the need for additional pain control) on patients who receive care under the ERAS protocol and compare it to historical controls.
