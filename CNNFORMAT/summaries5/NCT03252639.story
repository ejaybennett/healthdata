(firstQuint)A Study of Using Parenchymal Blood Volume(PBV) for Endovascular Treatment of Renal Arterial Stenosis.

 BACKGROUND: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is one of the main reasons for secondary hypertension and renal failure, which etiologies include atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia and takayasu arteritis.

 Endovascular treatment under digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an option to treat this disease.

 However, the technical success of this procedure is mainly based on morphology of its targeting renal artery without any quantified data towards renal blood perfusion.

 Thus, this study will try to solve how renal blood perfusion changes before and after endovascular treatment of renal artery stenosis.

 DESIGN NARRATIVE: This prospective cohort study will recruit patients with renal artery stenosis.

 PBV data will be obtained before and after their endovascular treatments.

 The volume of target kidney and its mean density of contrast from PBV data will be calculated as indicators for renal perfusion.

 And the relation between the percentage of stenosis and renal perfusion will be analyzed.

 The follow-up will last for one year.

 At 6-month and 12-month follow-up, DSA and PBV acquisition protocol will be undertaken again to evaluate renal blood perfusion in the long term.

This study will use PBV technique to quantitatively assess the improvement of renal perfusion before and after endovascular treatment (EVT) of renal artery stenosis.
