(firstQuint)Prescribing Smart Aging: Integrating Health Systems With Community-Based Lifestyle Interventions.

 The Smart Aging Program is designed to be scalable, implementable, and sustainable in the real world.

 This program joins patients and their clinicians with community-based fitness centers.

 The Smart Aging Program looks to use already existing resources to deliver an innovative program to increase physical activity in older adults.

 The program begins at the patient-physician level.

 The program is conducted in community-based fitness centers, the participant's home (home exercise, monitoring) and also sends physical activity data back to the clinician using mobile technology.

 The Smart Aging Program consists of a personalized and structured exercise program combined with lifestyle education and mobile-health monitoring.

 The exercise program includes a 12-week initiation phase, followed by a 40-week maintenance phase.
