(thirdQuint)Combination of TATE and PD-1 Inhibitor in Liver Cancer.

 The goal of the study is to investigate whether tumor necrosis induced by TATE treatment can boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor.

 Patients with advanced HCC or metastatic CRC with liver lesions will be enrolled in the study.

 Liver lesions will be treated with up to 4 TATE treatments for optimal debulking, which also serve as a vaccination process toward tumor.

 Lesion not treated with TATE will be used for monitoring the response toward a PD-1 inhibitor (either Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab per investigator decision).

 If a patient subsequently develops an "escape" to the PD-1 inhibitor, patient can have another 2 TATE treatments of the escaped tumor lesion.

 Dosing of the PD-1 inhibitor is per standard FDA-approved dosing schedule and continues until progressive disease.

 The efficacy will be assessed by the response rate (RR) using RECIST and irRC for the non-TATE treated lesion, and compared with the historic RR of the PD-1 inhibitor in HCC (~16%) and mCRC (almost 0% for those without mismatch repair defect).

 Combination of TATE and PD-1 Inhibitor in Liver Cancer@highlight

This is a single center, open-label phase IIA study that investigates the preliminary efficacy of TATE treatment of liver cancer followed by a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab).

 At least two cohorts will be enrolled, one for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the other with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
