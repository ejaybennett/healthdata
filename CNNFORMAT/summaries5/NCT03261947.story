(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of TAK-931 in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931.

 TAK-931 blocks the function of a specific protein in the body called CDC7 kinase.

 TAK-931 is being tested in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer plus a cohort of US patients with metastatic cancer with no other standard therapeutic alternative.

 This study will look at safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TAK-931 in people who take TAK-931.

 The study will enroll approximately 88 patients.

 Participants will be enrolled in 3 cohorts: 1) Western safety cohort to be enrolled in the US only which will include non-Japanese participants who have metastatic solid tumors with no standard therapeutic alternative, 2) Participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer 3) Participants with metastatic colorectal cancer.

 All participants will receive: cent TAK-931 50 mg All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the study.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States and Japan.

 The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 24 months.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and participants in both Western cohort and disease specific cohort will be followed-up for up to 12 weeks for progression-free survival.

 Once disease progression is confirmed, participants in disease-specific cohort will be followed for overall survival for up to 12 weeks after last dose of study drug.
