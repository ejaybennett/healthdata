(fifthQuint)Primary Cecal Pathologies Presenting as Acute Abdomen.

 The importance of cecal pathologies lie in the fact that being the first part of large intestine, any disease involving the cecum affects overall functioning of the large bowel.

 Primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen often pose a challenge to their optimal management due to requirement of urgent intervention in most cases and being a common source of misdiagnosis.

 These pathologies often mimic acute appendicitis and commonly misdiagnosed as one.

 This misdiagnosis can lead to under-treatment of the underlying pathology and this results in high morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions.

 So the accurate identification of such conditions is required so that the patients can be optimally managed and patient outcome can be improved.

 Primary Cecal Pathologies Presenting as Acute Abdomen@highlight

Background: The importance of cecal pathologies lie in the fact that being the first part of large intestine, any disease involving the cecum affects overall functioning of the large bowel.

 Primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen have not been described in any previous study in terms of presentation, management and outcome.

 Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the reported causes of primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen and the various causes presenting in Indian setting, to discuss morbidity and mortality associated with cecal pathologies and to critically analyse the various management modalities employed in emergency setting.
