(secondQuint)Individualizing Automated Closed Loop Glucose Control Through Pharmacokinetic Profiling in an Insulin-Only Bionic Pancreas.

 The investigators hypothesize that differences in the PK characteristics of insulin analogs will lead to differences in glycemic outcomes when delivered by the insulin-only configuration of the bionic pancreas.

 Specifically, the investigators predict that insulin analogs that have faster absorption (numerically lower Tmax and/or T 1/2max) and insulin analogs that have faster clearance (numerically lower terminal half-life) will result in lower mean glucose and/or a lower percentage of time in the hypoglycemic range.

 Up to 30 subjects will participate in three 7-day study arms using insulin lispro, aspart, and BioChaperone lispro in the bionic pancreas in random order.

 The co-primary outcomes will be mean CGMG and fraction of time spent with CGMG 180, >250 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, mean postprandial excursion (difference in CGMG from the time of meal announcement to the peak CGMG in the first 4 hours after the meal announcement), number of symptomatic hypoglycemic events, grams of carbohydrate consumed to treat hypoglycemia, and TDD of insulin.

 For each outcome the mean of daily means will be compared for each three pairwise comparisons between arms.

Subjects will participate in three weeks of the bionic pancreas in the insulin-only configuration.

 Each week, subjects will use a different rapid acting insulin analog -- Humalog, Novolog, or BioChaperone lispro -- in a randomized cross-over order.
