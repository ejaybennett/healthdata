(thirdQuint)Allogeneic ABCB5-positive Stem Cells for Treatment of DFU "Malum Perforans".

 This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer.

 Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will be expanded in vitro.

 The IMP incorporating the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied on the wound surface of DFU.

 Patients are followed up for efficacy for 3 months which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.

 The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography.

 The wound size evaluation will start two weeks after IMP application.

 The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.

 Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires.

 To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-DFU three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 post IMP applications are included.

The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound surface area reduction of Diabetic Foot Ulcers) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of the medicinal product to be studied after one single application on the wound surface of patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer.
