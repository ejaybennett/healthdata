(secondQuint)Laryngeal Allograft Transplantation.

 Patients with severe laryngeal or laryngotracheal incompetence without other reconstructive options will be considered for cadaveric laryngotracheal transplantation.

 Data will be collected from 10 patients and will include length of hospital stay, short-term complications, long-term complications, hospital readmission, return trips to the operating room (OR), rejection episodes and severity, swallowing function, ability to have tracheotomy tube decannulated, voice parameters, pulmonary function, development of anti-donor antibodies, and quality of life scores.
