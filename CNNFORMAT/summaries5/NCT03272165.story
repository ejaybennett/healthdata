(fifthQuint)Single Ascending Dose Study of MEDI1341 in Healthy Volunteers.

 This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending intravenous doses of MEDI1341 in male and nonfertile female healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 80 years.

 The study will include up to 5 planned cohorts; each cohort will comprise 8 subjects.

 Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive MEDI1341 and 2 will be randomized to receive placebo.

 A Safety Review Committee will review data from each cohort before progression to the next higher dose cohort occurs.

 An optional sixth cohort of 8 subjects may be studied, based on an interim review of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic data, with a dose level that may be lower than, the same as, or higher than for any preceding cohort.

 On Day 1, each randomized subject will receive a single 60 minute intravenous infusion of MEDI1341 or placebo and will undergo scheduled safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity assessments.

 Additional study assessments will occur on Days 2, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, and 92.
