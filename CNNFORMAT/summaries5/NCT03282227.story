(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety of M207 in the Acute Treatment of Migraine.

 This is an open-label, twelve-month safety study.

 There is a screening period followed by a run-in period (14 to 21 days) to determine eligibility for treatment with study medication based on daily eDiary data collection.

 Qualified subjects will receive study medication on Day 1 for up to twelve months for the treatment of migraine headaches.

 Migraines will be treated with a single dose, consisting of two patches, but subjects can treat multiple migraine attacks throughout the 12 months.

 Using the eDiary to confirm they are experiencing a qualified migraine, subjects will self-administer the patches and continue to respond to questions in the eDiary for 48 hours post treatment administration.
