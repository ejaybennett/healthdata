(thirdQuint)First-In Man (FIM) Study MR-Linac.

 This is a single center prospective proof of concept study including accuracy and safety aspects according to R-IDEAL stage 1 criteria.

 Five (5) patients with bone metastases will be treated with palliative intention in this study.

 Treatment will consist of a single fraction.

 The MR linear accelerator (MRL) integrates a radiotherapy accelerator and a diagnostic quality 1.

5T MRI, enabling soft-tissue visualization during the actual radiation delivery for improved targeting.

 This enables on-line treatment optimization for precise radiation delivery.

 Better visualization of the tumour targets and the surrounding healthy tissues, at the exact moment of treatment, makes it possible to adapt the dose to the actual anatomy while optimally sparing normal tissues.

 First-In Man (FIM) Study MR-Linac@highlight

Investigational device is the Magnetic resonance imager linear accelerator.

 Five (5) patients with bone metastases will be treated with palliative intention in this study.

 The goal is to confirm the pre-clinically demonstrated technical accuracy and safety of the newly developed MR-Linac in the clinical setting.
