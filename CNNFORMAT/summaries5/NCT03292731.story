(thirdQuint)Relationship Between Plasma Concentration of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (17-OHPC) and Preterm Birth.

 The study will determine the association between plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and the rate of preterm birth and will evaluate the impact of several potential covariates on plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC and its efficacy.

 17-OHPC (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) administration has proven effective in reducing preterm births in high risk groups but the current dose of 250mg administered IM is thought to be an inadequate for a substantial portion of women receiving the therapy.

 The potential benefit of identifying a therapeutic concentration range and of optimizing the dosage of 17-OHPC are substantial.

 Pregnant subjects with a history of a prior spontaneous preterm birth with be randomized to either the 250mg or 500mg weekly intramuscular injections.

 All subjects will have trough blood samples collected immediately prior to their second injection of the 17-OHPC, at 26-30 weeks (but only after a minimum of 7 injections have been administered) , 6-9 weeks later and at the time of delivery.

 Another tube of maternal blood will be collected during one of the scheduled blood samples for genotyping.

 A cord blood specimen will also be collected and with consent, a cord blood specimen will be collected for genetic studies of the infant.

 We will also collect a small sample of the placenta after delivery.

 Relationship Between Plasma Concentration of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (17-OHPC) and Preterm Birth@highlight

The study plans to determine the relationship between plasma concentrations of 17-OHPC (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) and the rate of preterm birth.

 The study is a randomized, open label study of pregnant women with one or more prior spontaneous preterm births.

 Subjects are randomized to a weekly single injection of either 250 or 500mg 17-OHPC (hydroxyprogesterone caproate).
