(thirdQuint)Prevention of Abdominal Wound Dehiscence After Midline Laparotomy With an Onlay Mesh.

 Abdominal wound dehiscence is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.

 It occurs in more than 8.

5% of high-risk patients.

 Current preventive measures described are control of risk factors and optimization of surgical technique.

 Despite that, the incidence of such complication remained stable in the last decades, highlighting the low efficacy of such measures.

 Polypropilene onlay mesh has been used to avoid incisional hernias in selected elective patients, and could be useful in the prevention of abdominal wound dehiscence.

 In emergency situations, especially in contaminated and infected surgical procedures, safety and efficacy of mesh is controversial.

 In this study the investigators aimed to evaluate the influence of polypropilene prophylactic onlay mesh on the incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence in high-risk patients undergoing midline laparotomy.

 As secondary outcome, the associated morbidity, including wound complications, will be analyzed.

 The study design will be a randomized controlled trial.

Abdominal wound dehiscence elicit high morbidity and mortality.

 This complication may arise in more than 8.

5% of high-risk patients.

 Addressing risk factors and optimizing surgical technique are guarded as mainstay measures for prevention, but their efficacy is questionable.

 The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of using a polypropylene onlay prophylactic mesh on the incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence and associated complications.
