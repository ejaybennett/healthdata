(fifthQuint)Comparison of Two Brief Mindfulness Intervention for Stress, Anxiety and Burnout in Mental Health Professionals.

 The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two mindfulness interventions for stress, anxiety and burnout in mental health professionals.

 It is a 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover design with sequences AB and BA.

 Treatment A consists of a block of five sessions of body mindfulness exercises, whereas experimental treatment B consists of a block of five sessions of sitting mindfulness meditation exercises.

 In the sixth session, the exercise blocks will be exchanged.

 Each group will be composed of 30 participants with a total sample of 60.

 The principal hypothesis is that both interventions will decrease stress and anxiety levels and professional burnout, with mindfulness body exercises being at least as effective as mindfulness sitting meditations.

 Secondarily, the personality type will be analyzed as a moderating variable in the effectiveness of the interventions.

 Te investigators will also study the role of daily practices and previous expectations in the results of this intervention.

 Finally, a qualitative study will be conducted in order to analyze the the acceptability and use-effectiveness in mental health professionals who are beginner meditators.

 This study will allow to understand what types of personality may benefit most from different types of meditation interventions.
