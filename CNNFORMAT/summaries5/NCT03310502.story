(fifthQuint)Variation of Genes Controlling Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism.

 The data is collected as a separate part of the clinical imaging study protocols using a separate inform consent approved by the local ethics committee.

 The participation for this study consists of drawing whole blood, serum and plasma samples for genetics, proteomics and metabolomics analyses.

 The results from these studies are combined with baseline data from the original clinical imaging studies to find connections between genetic variation, metabolism, blood flow and body fat distribution in a cross-sectional setting.

 Variation of Genes Controlling Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism@highlight

Aim of the study is to investigate genes regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in subjects whose glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, blood flow, or body fat distribution has been measured using positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or computed tomography (CT) as part of their previous participation in clinical trials conducted at Turku PET Centre.

 By combining information from PET, MRI, CT, proteomics, metabolomics and genetics analyses we aim to find connection between genetic variation and metabolic and cardiovascular disease.
