(fifthQuint)STEMI and Incretins Treatment.

 ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients affected by multivessels coronary artery stenosis represent a class of patients really challenging to treat.

 In fact, treatment, clinical management, and prognosis are supported by few literature data.

 Therefore, in this study authors enrolled real world patients admitted for STEMI and associated to multi vessels coronary disease.

 Multivessels (Mv) coronary stenosis were characterized by non obstructive coronary stenosis (NOCS) as coronary lesions 0.

8.

 Therefore, STEMI was treated by percutaneous coronary intervention by primary angioplasty and direct stenting (DES stenting) of culprit vessel lesion.

 Then these STEMI-Mv-NOCS patients were divided in diabetics vs.

 non diabetics, and received conventional full medical therapy for STEMI.

 Then these diabetics were divided in incretin users (6 months of incretin treatment before study enrollment) vs.

 never incretin users.

 Study outcomes were all cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and major adverse cardiac events at 12 months follow up.

 Authors studied these study outcomes comparing diabetics vs.

 non diabetics at 12 moths follow up, and diabetics incretin-users vs.

 never-incretin-users.
