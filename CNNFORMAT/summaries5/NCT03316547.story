(fifthQuint)Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE).

 The birth of an infant is a time of excitement and joy.

 However, when an infant is born preterm, parents often experience fear, anxiety, stress, and disappointment.

 Contrasting a full-term birth, the preterm infant is initially separated from the family and thrust into a medical environment, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to sustain life.

 Parents are often 'visitors', and the traditional parenting role is challenged.

 Difficulties in caring for their infants further exacerbate their anxiety and stress, prompting coping through withdrawing or avoiding participation in care.

 This can have long-term effects on the infant's development and the parent-child relationship.

 While the preterm infant needs medical care, they also have a great developmental need for human engagement, particularly with their parents.

 Changing the model of care to fully engage and support parents in providing developmentally appropriate, positive sensory-based exposures within the tenuous NICU environment is possible and can result in positive benefits for both the infant and family.

 Approximately 12%, or 500,000 infants, are born preterm each year in the United States alone.

 Although survival rates of preterm infants have increased with advances in medical care, the risk of developmental delay and disability has remained constant.

 Very preterm infants (<32 weeks gestation) necessitate care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for an average of three months after birth, which is a significant period of time coinciding with a critical window of brain development.

 While medical factors, such as brain injury, can heighten the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome, the NICU environment may also have deleterious effects on early brain structure and function.

 The Influence of Early Environment: Maternal deprivation and isolation from positive sensory experiences are prominent features of orphan studies.

 Consequences of language and human deprivation include emotional disturbances, delayed cognitive and language skills, and abnormalities evident on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 Although the preterm infant differs from a child who has been institutionalized or deprived of caregiving attention after full term birth, there are similarities, such as the altered temporal lobe structures, and the pattern of developmental impairments.

 There is growing evidence supporting the importance of parents in the NICU.

 Low frequency visits between parents and their hospitalized preterm infants have been associated with suboptimal outcomes, like child abuse and abandonment and adverse emotional functioning.

 NICU's in Sweden have been successful with engaging parents in care from admission to discharge and have reported shorter hospitalizations.

 There is also a growing body of evidence supporting positive sensory exposures for preterm infants, including maternal voice recordings, massage, skin-to-skin holding, and vestibular and kinesthetic interventions.

 In addition, my team has made important research findings pointing to the potential need for developmentally-appropriate sensory exposures in the NICU.

 Outcomes Associated with Preterm Birth: While advances in medical technologies have improved the rates of survival among preterm infants, the risk of long-term morbidities remains high, with 50-70% of very preterm infants exhibiting developmental problems.

 In addition to motor problems, language and communication problems are common in former preterm infants when studied at school age, and recent evidence suggests that language deficits persist through childhood.

 Language difficulties have also been shown to affect a broad range of factors important for social prowess and academic achievement.

 In addition, preterm infants have a heightened risk of attachment disorders and other social-emotional problems.

 Outcomes Associated with Parenting a Preterm Infant: Many negative psychological sequelae are associated with parenting a preterm infant, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress.

 Such negative parental mental health outcomes proceed to influence the parent-child relationship, leading to a parent's inability to recognize infant cues as well as increased negativity and intrusiveness.

 Negative maternal-child interactions continue into the first several months of life if stress remains high.

 Forming such a foundation may then lead to negative child outcomes associated with social-emotional development, including attachment insecurity, and mental health issues.

 Sensory Stimuli and Current Practice in the NICU: High-risk infants who receive care in the NICU are exposed to significant stressors that include painful procedures, disruption of normal sensory experiences, and stress related to parent-infant separation.

 In addition to the loss of parental nurturing, there is growing concern that stress during a period of extensive brain development may result in permanent and deleterious developmental outcomes.

 Developmental care, which includes sensory minimization, has been the predominant model of care in the NICU since the 1980s, because the bright and noisy environment, which exceeds sensory standards set by the American Academy of Pediatrics, is understood to adversely affect growth and development of the preterm infant.

 In support of developmental care principles, NICU staff makes efforts to reduce modifiable stimuli to the high risk infant in the NICU.

 However, developmental care has mixed results.

 There is emerging research on the positive effects of sensory stimulation for preterm infants in the NICU.

 Positive sensory exposures in the NICU are critical, as they can have life-long implications on learning, memory, emotions, and developmental progression.

 In an environment where stimuli are primarily negative, it is especially important to define and implement positive sensory exposures.

 Further, it is well understood that multi-dimensional sensory exposures are present in utero in the final months and weeks of pregnancy, but the preterm infant misses potentially important, timed exposures that may be absent or altered in the NICU environment.

 Positive forms of sensory exposure during periods of infant readiness may be important to facilitate appropriate neural pathways and enable positive experiences.

 While evidence is emerging on the importance of positive sensory experiences in the NICU, mostly in response to developmental care principles and to promote better outcomes, hospitals around the globe are providing private rooms for infants and families.

 The private room can decrease sensory exposure and provide a quiet, intimate environment for parents to engage with their infants.

 However, my team demonstrated there are some drawbacks to private rooms.

 Specific Aim #1: Define the type and timing of optimal sensory exposure for very preterm infants hospitalized in the NICU and evaluate the implementation of an intentional sensory exposure plan.

 Results from a rigorous systematic review, benchmarking, and expert opinion are being used to develop a clinical practice guideline for sensory-based interventions for hospitalized, very preterm infants using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument.

 The manualized intervention, from the integrative review and development of the implementation plan, set to be completed by November 2015 (funding from the University Research Strategic Alliance), will include evidenced-based interventions that can be conducted by parents with their preterm infants across postmenstrual age while hospitalized (see Appendix 1 for a working model of the intervention plan).

 The sensory-based intervention will include the provision of specific amounts of auditory, tactile, vestibular, kinesthetic, and visual exposure to be conducted daily through hospitalization.

 The intervention plan is intended to be implemented by parents (when available), and by surrogates when the parents are unable to be present in the hospital.

 Surveys and focus groups of a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals and parents of preterm infants in the NICU are being conducted to assess acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the sensory-based intervention plan.

 The investigators will enroll 30 very preterm infants within the first week of life after obtaining informed consent from the family at St.

 Louis Children's Hospital.

 Thirty infants will enable implementation of the intervention with adequate participants to make modifications and establish feasibility, while enabling those enrolled last to benefit from the finalized intervention after all modifications are made.

 The study site has a commitment to continuous change that will improve care as well as a track record of successful implementation science projects.

 Members of the research team (occupational therapists, physical therapists and psychologists) will instruct caregivers about the manualized sensory-based intervention plan.

 Additional support from the research team will be provided for caregivers daily or weekly, as needed.

 When available, parents will be encouraged to carry out the sensory-based interventions with their infant.

 A member of the research team or another surrogate (Child Life, volunteers, alternate family members, graduate students, or interns) will conduct the defined sensory interventions and model the protocol for the parents when the parents are unable to fully engage in care.

 My research team will initiate, educate and act as models as well as will assess the implementation outcomes in this phase.

 Logging sheets will be placed at the infant's bedside to document the execution of sensory-based interventions, who conducted the intervention (parent, member of research team or other caregiver), infant responses and consequences of the intervention.

 Physiological (such as heart rate and oxygen saturation fluctuations), state (levels of arousal) and behavioral (such as crying, changes in motoric tone) responses will be recorded by caregivers during interventions on the bedside logs.

 Negative sequelae of the intervention will result in stopping the intervention and modifying the criteria for sensory-based interventions accordingly.

 A licensed therapist will provide guidance as to when infants can and cannot tolerate sensory exposures.

 From clinical documentation and bedside logging, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability will be assessed.

 Nurses and parents will also be questioned to define caregiver perceptions and time commitment.

 At least 2 focus groups with health care professionals and parents of preterm infants will be conducted to assess perceptions and to incorporate feedback into the intervention plan.

 Adaptations to the model for an enhanced sensory environment will be made until it is deemed appropriate by the investigative team.

 This will occur when the model for an enhanced sensory environment can be documented through a minimum of 75% of hospitalization on at least 3 consecutive participants.

 Specific Aim #2: Assess the effect of a sensory-based intervention in the NICU on outcomes of preterm infants and their families.

 After obtaining informed consent, 62 (after 30 infants in the pilot group) very preterm infants will be randomized to 2 levels of sensory exposure: the sensory-based intervention or traditional care group.

 The parents of infants in the sensory-based intervention group will be educated and supported to conduct sensory interventions with their infants using the systematized protocol.

 The standard of care group will have therapists and nurses provide and educate parents about sensory exposures.

 For both care groups, infant neurobehavior and feeding, sensory processing, mother-infant interaction, and parent mental health will be assessed at term age prior to hospital discharge.

 Child development, sensory processing, and parent mental health will be measured again at age one year corrected using standardized measures.

 Differences between groups will be explored.

 Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE)@highlight

Sixty-two preterm infants born less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation will be put into either the sensory-based intervention (experiment) group or traditional care (control) group.

 Consecutive admissions at St.

 Louis Children's Hospital (SLCH) who are hospitalized in a private NICU room will be recruited.

 The parents of infants in the sensory-based intervention group will be educated and supported by trained therapists to give different positive sensory experiences to their infants while hospitalized.

 The traditional care group with receive normal, standard care while hospitalized.

 For both care groups, infant neurobehavior, sensory processing, and parent mental health will be measured at term age prior to hospital discharge.

 Child development, sensory processing, and parent mental health will be measured again at age one year (corrected).

 Differences between the two groups will be explored.
