(firstQuint)Early Diagnosis of Small Pulmonary Nodules by Multi-omics Sequencing.

 Early diagnosis of lung cancer is of vital importance in lung cancer treatment.

 This research will first analyse the features of immune repertoire and genetic mutations from tissue of benign and malignant pulmonary nodule,then explore the feasibility of detecting these features from peripheral blood sample, and finally evaluate peripheral blood detection of lung cancer related immune repertoire and genetic mutations for identifying nature of pulmonary nodule.
