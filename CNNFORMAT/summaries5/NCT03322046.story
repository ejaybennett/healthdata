(fifthQuint)Heartmatters Challenge - First Responders.

 A cluster randomization of first responder communities in the metro Boston and metro Phoenix areas was performed.

 First responders attended a one hour lecture on the specific risks of CVD in that population and then qualified intervention candidates were enrolled into a lifestyle program, consisting of telephone-based coaching sessions with a registered dietitian and an online/app based food journaling program.

 Both groups had blood test draws at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

 The intervention group met with the team practitioner to review results and progress after each blood draw.

 The test panel comprised blood-based markers of CVD risk associated with lipid metabolism, metabolics, inflammation and basic liver and kidney function.

The purpose of this protocol is to observe whether providing the first responder population with a multi-tiered therapeutic lifestyle modification program, including regular blood testing, diet and telephonic lifestyle coaching, daily food journaling using web-based tools and smartphone apps can lead to positive changes in behavior, resulting in improvements in blood based markers of risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as improvements in weight and waist circumference.
