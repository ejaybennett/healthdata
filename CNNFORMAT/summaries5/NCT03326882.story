(secondQuint)Glidescope Videolaryngoscope and Macintosh Laryngoscope in Children.

 This was a prospective randomized clinical study to be performed in pediatric patients older than 1 years who are undergoing surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation.

 Time to endotracheal intubation was compared between patients intubated using a GlideScope(R) video laryngoscope, and those intubated by standard direct laryngoscopy.

 The main objective of this study was to evaluate the intubation time of Glidescope compared with Macintoch laryngoscope in pediatric patients, ease of intubation, and cardiovascular changes during intubation.
