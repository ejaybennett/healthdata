(secondQuint)A Real-World Study of Pegylated Interferon In Nucleoside-treated Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B.

 Patents who were treated with NA at least one year and achieved hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression and HBsAg level<3000 international unit (IU) /mL are enrolled in this study, they are assigned into two groups, in group I, patients will receive pegylated interferon plus entecavir/tenofovir for 48/72/96 weeks, in group II, patients will receive entecavir/tenofovir for 96 weeks.

 HBsAg loss rates at the end of treatment and sustained response at the end of follow up will be evaluated.

 A Real-World Study of Pegylated Interferon In Nucleoside-treated Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B@highlight

The aim of the prospective real-world study is to evaluate whether sequential combination therapy with pegylated interferon plus entecavir/tenofovir could induce higher rates of HBsAg loss in nucleoside-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to continuous nucleoside treatment.
