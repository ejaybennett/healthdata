(fifthQuint)Rapid Self-Testing to Prevent Fentanyl Overdose Among Young People Who Use Drugs.

 The research team will administer a brief survey to ascertain behavioral, psychosocial, and clinical factors that may be related to non-prescription fentanyl (NPF) exposure among young people who use illicit drugs.

 The researchers will also characterize knowledge of and perceptions towards drugs contaminated with NPF, as well as the potential diversion of prescription fentanyl formulations (e.

g.

, transdermal patches).

 After the interviewer-administered survey has been completed, participants will provide urine samples to determine recent exposure to NPF and other illicit drugs.

 The research team will assess the acceptability and feasibility of "take home rapid drug tests" to test for fentanyl exposure among 100 participants from the target population.

 After the enrollment and baseline survey, participants will be provided with rapid drug tests that detect the presence or absence of fentanyl in their drug supply.

 Half the participants will be asked to test their urine to see if they have been exposed to a fentanyl-contaminated drug.

 The other half will be asked to test the residue of the drug that they intend to use.

 Study participants will then be asked to return in 2 weeks for a brief follow-up survey that will assess whether they used the self-tests, whether the technology was acceptable and easy to use, and whether and how a positive test result altered their drug-using and overdose prevention behaviors.

 Rapid Self-Testing to Prevent Fentanyl Overdose Among Young People Who Use Drugs@highlight

The research team will enroll 100 young adults who use cocaine, heroin, inject drugs, or purchase prescription medications on the illicit market in a pilot study to be known as the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription and Illicit Drug Study (RAPIDS).

 Participants will be trained to use a take-home home rapid drug test to test for the presence or absence of fentanyl in their drug supply.

 Half of the enrolled participants will be asked to test their urine for presence or absence of fentanyl, and the other half will be asked to test their drug residue for presence or absence of fentanyl.

 All participants will receive up to 15 take-home rapid drug tests for fentanyl.

 A follow-up survey will examine and compare utilization of the tests between the two groups.

 The study will be guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of engagement in health behaviors.

 The IMB model hypothesizes that if a person possesses the information, motivation, and behavioral skills to act, there is an increased likelihood that she/he will fulfill and maintain the desired behaviors (behaviors that will reduce accidental overdose).
