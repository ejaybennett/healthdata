(fifthQuint)Fascia Iliaca Blocks for Pain Control After Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 The FICB is a regional block that anesthetizes the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves around the hip joint.

 There have been numerous study assessing it's ability to control pain in the pre and post operative period in patients with hip fractures.

 However, there is a limited amount of literature on its efficacy after total hip arthroplasty, and no data when a posterior surgical approach to the hip was utilized.

 Because regional blocks have been shown to decrease pain post operatively after total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesize that the FICB will decrease pain and narcotic use in patients after total hip arthroplasty.

 This study will aim to recruit 120 patients that will be randomized to receive a FICB or placebo in the recovery room within 30 minutes of leaving the OR.

 Once the intervention is complete we will collect data on the patients' pain levels, morphine equivalents of narcotic that they used, and how well they worked with physical therapy during their inpatient stay.

 Fascia Iliaca Blocks for Pain Control After Total Hip Arthroplasty@highlight

The fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is a regional block that anesthetizes the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves around the hip.

 The purpose of this study is to determine whether FICB can reduce postoperative pain and increase progress with physical therapy after total hip arthroplasty (THA).

 This randomized, double-blind, clinical trial will randomize patients to receive either a FICB or placebo after THA.

 The primary outcomes will be pain scores reported by the patient post-operatively.
