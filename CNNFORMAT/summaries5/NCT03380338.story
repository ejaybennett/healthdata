(secondQuint)The Effect of Exercise on Gut Microbiota in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 Diet and exercise are the most beneficial lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, causing an increase in glucose tolerance.

 One of the mechanisms through which these treatment modalities work might be explained through changes in the gut microbiota.

 Recent studies show that the chronic inflammatory status causing insulin resistance in DM type 2, is triggered by an increase in circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

 Strict lifestyle intervention, such as exercise, so called Diabetes Bootcamp (DB), may manipulate the gut microbiota, reducing circulating LPS, causing an improvement of the insulin-mediated.
