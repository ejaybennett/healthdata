(firstQuint)Tear Lipid Layer Thickness With Emollient Eye Drops.

 This study will objectively evaluate two US Monograph lubricant eyedrop formulations (Allergan, plc).

 Refresh Optive ADVANCED will be compared to an investigational formula with additional compendial ingredients (Refresh Optive MEGA 3) in subjects with dry eye symptoms and lipid layer thickness < 65 nm at baseline in a randomized, cross-over (masked subject) design.

 We seek to objectively evaluate the increase in lipid layer thickness from baseline at 15 minutes and 1, 2 and 4 hours after each eye drop has been instilled.

 The Stroboscopic Video Color Microscope of King-Smith is used for non-invasive lipid layer thickness measurement.
