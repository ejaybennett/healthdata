(fifthQuint)Diet, Physical Activity and Related Candidate Biomarkers in Relation to Prostate Cancer Risk (BIOCaPPE).

 The main objective of the proposed research project is to assess the association between five candidate biological markers potentially modifiable by environmental exposures (diet and physical activity) and the two-year risk of prostate cancer in a newly recruited cohort of men at high-risk of prostate cancer showing no evidence of cancer.

 Four hospitals in the province of Quebec (Canada) participate to the recruitment of 3,080 men at high-risk for prostate cancer, i.

e.

 men who had a first negative prostate biopsy or whose Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) level is between 2.

5 and 10 ng / ml without previous prostate biopsy.

 The candidate biomarkers that will be tested are: 1.

 The ratio of -3/ -6 fatty acid content of red blood cell membranes, 2.

 Oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.

 Adiponectin 4.

 Insulin growth factor-1 5.

 The ratio of dihydrotestosterone glucuronide derivatives over estradiol A biobank, composed of biological material (whole blood, plasma, serum, lymphocyte layer and excess tissue collected from prostate biopsy or prostate surgery) and clinical data is being created.

 Questionnaires are used to compile information on socio-demographic aspects, family and personal medical history, quality of life, lifestyle like food and sexual habits.

 Diet, Physical Activity and Related Candidate Biomarkers in Relation to Prostate Cancer Risk (BIOCaPPE)@highlight

The risk of prostate cancer is associated with lifestyle habits, such as diet and physical activity.

 Indeed, results of numerous studies suggest links between obesity, diabetes, inflammation and androgen and estrogen metabolism in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

 The goal of BIOCaPPE study (Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer/ Prevention and Environment) is to identify biomarkers of prostate cancer risk that are potentially modifiable by environmental exposures (e.

g.

 diet and physical activity).

 A selection of few of the most promising biological markers will be evaluated in a cohort of more than 3000 men at high-risk of prostate cancer.

 Such biomarkers would provide a practical approach to identify men at high risk of prostate cancer who could benefit from interventions aiming at reducing their risk.

 The biomarkers would also be useful to monitor the efficacy of the interventions on patient's lifestyle.
