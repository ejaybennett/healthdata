(firstQuint)Carbon Monoxide Headache Triggering Properties as Well as Effects on the Brain's Vessels and Blood Flow.

 In this study we will systematically investigate the headache-releasing properties of carbon monoxide as well as measure the effect of carbon monoxide on mean blood flow rate in the brain's large vessel with magnetic resonance imaging.

 These studies are important for understanding and further investigating the carbon monoxide's headache-releasing effect in healthy subjects.
