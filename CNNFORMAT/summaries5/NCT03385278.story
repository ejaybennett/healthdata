(thirdQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Patients With Disorders of Consciousness.

 Background:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was supposed as an experimental approach to disorders of consciousness treatment.

 Its therapeutic effects have been variously documented.

 Objective: The study aimed to investigate the reactivity of electroencephalography (EEG) and the clinical response of patients with disorders of consciousness and explore the neuromodulatory effects of high-frequency rTMS in DOC.

 Method:In this randomised,sham-controlled study,real or sham 20 Hz rTMS were applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) of participants with disorders of consciousness for 5 consecutive days .

 Evaluations were blindly performed at baseline, immediately after the end of the 5-days treatment and 1 week later with the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scale and EEG.

 Hypothesis:Real rTMS can be an effective awakening method.

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Patients With Disorders of Consciousness@highlight

Transcranial magnetic stimulation involves the use of alternating magnetic fields to stimulate neurons in the brain.

To date, several studies have focused on the use of TMS in patients with impaired consciousness.

However,its therapeutic effects have been variously documented.

So,in this study ,investigators explore the effects of rTMS with cross-over design.
