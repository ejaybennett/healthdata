(firstQuint)Study of Pembrolizumab and Concurrent Radiation in Patients With Previously Treated Carcinoma of Unknown Primary.

 This is a proof-of-principle single-arm phase 2 study in patients with previously treated CUP.

 All patients receive pembrolizumab combined with RT to a metastatic site, so as to induce an abscopal tumor response.

 The treatment combination will be repeated with RT delivery to a second metastatic site in a non-overlapping RT field.

 The results will be compared with historical control.

 The primary endpoint is the confirmed response rate (RR) in a non-irradiated site based on best responding abscopal lesion.

 This study will also evaluate the following secondary endpoints: RR in a non-irradiated site based on RECIST 1.

1, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time-to-progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR).
