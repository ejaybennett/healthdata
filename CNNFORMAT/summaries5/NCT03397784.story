(secondQuint)IVC Variation After VT Challenge to Predict Fluid Responsiveness.

 The "tidal volume challenge" is a novel test to predict fluid responsiveness in patents in shock, ventilated using low tidal volume without spontaneous breathing activity.

 The test involves transiently increasing tidal volume from 8 ml/kg PBW to 12 ml/kg PBW for one minute and observing the change in PPV or SVV.

 The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter after tidal volume challenge can predict fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients with mechanical ventilation.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of using the respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameters as an index of fluid responsiveness after tidal volume challenge in mechanically ventilated patients after cardiac surgery.
