(firstQuint)The Resilient Minds Program in Fire Departments.

 THE PROBLEM: Firefighters are frequently exposed to distressing events, or critical incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, burnt bodies, failed rescue attempts, threats to one's own life, and completed suicides that can trigger posttraumatic stress reactions.

 Previous research show that first responders and other public safety personnel report frequent exposure to traumatic events and are at increased risk for mental health illnesses.

 THE STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a mental health training program in volunteer and career firefighters.

 THE STUDY SAMPLE: 240 firefighters (volunteer or career) in Prince Edward Island INTERVENTION: Vancouver Fire & Rescue Services and the Canadian Mental Health Association-Vancouver Fraser co-developed a new program called, "Resilient Minds-Building the Psychological Health of Fire Fighters.

" The Resilient Minds training will educate firefighters about the effects of trauma, how to recognize signs of mental health illness and how to access support after critical events.

 It also trains firefighters to recognize mental health and addictions in co-workers and how to facilitate their help-seeking.

 OUTCOMES: The impact of the program will be assessed by pre- and post-program surveys and a 3-month follow-up survey.
