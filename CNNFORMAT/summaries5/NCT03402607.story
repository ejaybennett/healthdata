(secondQuint)Trial Comparing PLA to HIGRT Therapy (PROVE-HCC).

 Primary liver cancer is the world's third most common cause of cancer death.

 In the United States, unlike other malignancies such as breast, prostate and lung cancer, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing.

 The present gold standard for HCC patients who are medically fit is HCC resection or liver transplant.

 Surgery is a treatment option for just one third of patients with HCC.

 For the patients who are not fit for surgery either due to underlying liver disease with associated liver dysfunction or other co-morbidity, a number of non-operative treatments are available for treatment including percutaneous tumor ablation (PLA) or the emerging option of external beam radiotherapy techniques, such as hypo-fractionated image guided radiation therapy (HIGRT) -also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

 Percutaneous local ablation (PLA) selectively targets the tumor with an additional intentional margin of 0.

5-1cm of non-cancerous liver tissue and induces tumor cell death, most often via coagulative necrosis.

 Local application of chemical agents or microwave/radiofrequency waves does not induce systemic effects and is typically performed under real-time ultrasound guidance using local anesthesia and conscious sedation.

 Worldwide, RFA is the most commonly used ablation technique.

 In the US, MWA is quickly becoming the preferred modality of PLA.

 MWA induces thermal injury through the delivery of electromagnetic energy and the application of rapidly alternating microwave frequency current leads to coagulative necrosis of tissue.

 Compared with RFA, MWA appears to be more effective for lesions in close proximity to the portal or hepatic veins; heat sink is less of an issue given increased speed with which therapy can be delivered.

 Additionally, tumor sizes >3cm sometimes can be effectively treated with MWA.

 A recent meta-analysis comparing RFA to MWA for primary HCC showed they had similar efficacy, although MWA appeared to have improved local tumor control over RFA in the treatment larger tumors.

 Advances in radiotherapy simulation, treatment planning and delivery integrated together collectively termed HIGRT or SBRT, have facilitated safe dose escalation to HCC.

 A number of small, single institutional prospective studies have evaluated the use of HIGRT for treatment of HCC.

 These experiences suggest that HIGRT is well tolerated and yields excellent local control rates, however, follow up is short and thus many institutions and consensus guidelines favor ablation for early stage HCC patients who are not surgical candidates.

 The benefits of HIGRT are that it is a non-invasive, outpatient procedure typically delivered in 3-10 fractions.

 Although no randomized studies have compared HIGRT with other local therapies, in retrospective analysis outcomes appear comparable , warranting further evaluation.

 Health-related quality of life (QOL) for patients with HCC is important.

 QOL targets are important post-treatment metrics; previous studies have shown that both pre-treatment QOL and post-treatment QOL have been associated with overall survival in various cancers.

 While both PLA and SBRT can ablate tumors, they do have known impacts on patients' QOL.

 QOL has recently been reported as a clinically important target in patients treated with HIGRT for HCC.

 Patients who are potentially eligible for study enrollment will be identified by their treating physician.

 Ninety patients will be randomized with equal allocation to the two arms.

 .

 Randomization will be stratified by whether the baseline QOL score is 60, where QOL is measured by the QLQ-C30 scale.

 The primary outcome is the change in QOL from baseline to 1 month.

 The investigators anticipate that approximately 10% of the accrued patients will withdraw before 1 month, leaving 80 evaluable patients to be used in the statistical analyses.

 The general linear model will be used to test for an arm effect (in patients receiving PLA vs HIGRT) by regressing change across time in QOL on arm, controlling for the baseline value of QOL and the Child Pugh score.

 To calculate the power of the arm effect (in patients receiving PLA vs HIGRT) on change in QOL, the investigators first note that the standard deviation of a normally distributed change score (SDC) depends upon the SD of the pre-score, the SD of the post-score, and the Pearson correlation () between the two scores.

 If the SD's of the pre-score and the post-score are assumed equal and the correlation between them is 0.

50, then SDC = SD.

 For purposes of the power calculation the investigators assume that SD=10 and = 0.

5; therefore SDC= 10.

 Assuming 40 evaluable patients per arm, the two-sample t-test (1-sided alpha = 0.

10) of an arm difference in change across time in QoL has power 0.

82 when the true arm difference in change score is 5 (i.

e.

, 50% of SDC).

 An arm difference of 50% of a standard deviation of an outcome variable is generally considered to be a "medium"-sized effect.

 In order to have 80 evaluable patients, 90 patients will be accrued (assuming drop out prior to the 1 month EOTRC QOL-C30 questionnaire).

 Patients will be on study therapy for approximately 6 months.

 The end of study participation will be at the completion of the 6 month survey, approximately 180 days post treatment (+/- 30 days).

 Thereafter patients will continue to be followed by the treating physician as per standard of care for follow up care and long-term follow up information will continue to be collected.

 Trial Comparing PLA to HIGRT Therapy (PROVE-HCC)@highlight

This phase II, randomized trial will compare Quality of Life for patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who are not surgical candidates or decline surgery and are treated with Percutaneous Local Ablation (PLA) or Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (HIGRT).
