(firstQuint)Antecedent Picky Eating Behaviour in Young Children.

 Singleton children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children will be studied prospectively (n=5758-6608).

 Parental-completion questionnaires will be used to define 'picky eating' status at age 3 years, and child and parental feeding behaviours and practices throughout the first 2 years of the child's life.

 Multinomial logistic regression models with 3 levels of picky eating status (not, somewhat and very picky) as the dependant variables will be used to test associations with antecedent variables, first assessing variables from pregnancy, and the first and second year of life, separately, then combining all significant variables in a final model.
