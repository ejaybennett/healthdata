(thirdQuint)A Patient-centered Intervention Using Technology to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Disparities in Primary Care.

 Patients (N=3,000) will be recruited via a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient-randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing.

 Patients identified as eligible will be contacted through MyChart to test a web-based, culturally-sensitive virtual human intervention for CRC screening.

 The web-application will provide information to encourage CRC screening.

 Therefore, this study is a minimal risk study.
