(firstQuint)Austrian Registry on Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts.

 Patients with advanced chronic liver disease may develop portal hypertension, which is the main cause for most complications and deaths of patients with liver cirrhosis.

 Implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) leads to instantaneous alleviation of portal hypertension, but may cause hepatic encephalopathy.

 Stent grafts, as well as patient stratification and medical surveillance, have drastically improved over the past decades.

 However, there are few data on long-term outcome after TIPS implantation.

This prospective registry study will assess the clinical course of patients after undergoing TIPS intervention and biomarkers for complications after TIPS implantation.

Patients with TIPS will be recruited in this prospective registry study.

 The clinical course will be documented and biomarkers for prediction of complicatiosn will be assessed.
