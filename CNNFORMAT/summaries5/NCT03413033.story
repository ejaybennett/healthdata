(secondQuint)Immediate Effects of Two Semi-occluded Vocal Tract Exercises.

 SOVT is a voice education or rehabilitation method that involves different postures which partially occlude or elongate the vocal tract.

 It causes a change in the vibration pattern of the vocal folds.

 SOVT postures have been postulated to produce changes in contact quotient (CQ), measured with electroglottograph (EGG), as well as in stroboscopy parameters.

 Despite all the research, some results remain inconclusive.

 This study aims to observe the physiological effects of two different SOVT exercises in larynx and pharynx when they are executed by people with constant vocal effort and without vocal pathology.

 In order to do so, stroboscopy and EGG will be performed before and while 24 volunteers execute two SOVT exercises (tongue trill and resonance tubes).

 The following parameters will be captured: CQ, symmetry, amplitude, periodicity, mucosal wave, closure, vertical laryngeal position, anterior-to-posterior compression and pharyngeal width.

 An analysis of covariance will be used to observe the effect of the SOVT exercises.
