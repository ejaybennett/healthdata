(secondQuint)Preliminary Study 1 to Test the Effects of Ambulatory Voice Biofeedback.

 We will conduct this study (based on principles of motor learning) using novel smartphone-based ambulatory voice biofeedback systems aimed at improving the carryover of newly established vocal behaviors into daily life.

 This first study will determine which of three types of ambulatory feedback results in better learning/retention (100% frequency, 25% frequency, or delayed summary feedback every 2 minutes of voicing) of a new vocal behavior (reduced vocal intensity) in three groups of 15 patients with vocal fold nodules.

 Hypothesis: Patients receiving lower frequency or summary feedback will produce lower initial performance but higher short- and long-term retention than patients receiving feedback 100% of the time.

 Preliminary Study 1 to Test the Effects of Ambulatory Voice Biofeedback@highlight

This first study will enroll 3 groups of patients with vocal fold nodules that will receive different schedules of ambulatory voice biofeedback (100% frequency feedback, 25% frequency feedback, summary feedback) to avoid their upper 15th percentile of vocal loudness.
