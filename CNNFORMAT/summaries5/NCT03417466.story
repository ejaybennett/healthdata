(firstQuint)A Pivotal Study to Evaluate Enlite Sensor Performance With iPro2 in China.

 This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective single-sample correlational design without controls.

 Up to 72 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 60 subjects complete the study.

 Three investigational centers in China will be used during this study.

 Each subject will wear the following devices: cent Two Enlite Sensors each connected to an iPro2 for approximately 6 days Sensor Location: cent The 2 Enlite Sensors will be worn in the abdomen area.

 Investigational center staff will insert sensors and connect to the iPro2s.

 During the study, each subject will be randomized and undergo one Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI cent ) frequent sample testing (FST) (Day 1, 3-4, or 6).

 During the study, subjects will continue with their current diabetes regimen independent of the study devices.

 Subjects will be instructed by the investigational center that they are not to use the study devices (except for the study meter) for the management of their diabetes.

 The Study Meter may be used for treatment decisions and calibration of Enlite Sensor.
