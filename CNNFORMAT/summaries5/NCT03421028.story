(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Biofeedback Therapy Efficiency in Sleep Bruxism and Masticatory Muscles Pain Management.

 1.

 The Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in reducing pain, increased tension of masticatory muscles occurring in patients with sleep bruxism and intensity of sleep bruxism episodes.

 2.

 Patients: 1.

 Control group - randomly selected healthy adult patients.

 The Group will include between 20-30 adults.

 2.

 Experimental group - patients with diagnosed sleep bruxism and masticatory muscle pain.

 The group will include approximately 30 adults.

 3.

 Methods: All patients taking part in the study will be examined according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) to find the masticatory muscles disorders.

 Based on the guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (ICD 10- CM), a preliminary diagnosis of sleep bruxism will be made.

 Bruxoff device will be used to performed objective confirmation of the initial diagnosis and severity of bruxism - number of bruxism episodes per hour of sleep (Bruxism Episodes Index).

 Bruxoff is a sleep monitor which measures the activity of masticatory muscles and rhythm of the patient's heart during sleep.

 Intensity of pain in the masticatory muscle muscles will be define using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.

 Sleep quality will be assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and insomnia symptoms with Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS).

 People participating in the study (experimental group) will undergo a cycle of FES delivering stimulation to relax masseter muscles and EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training decreasing the masseter muscle tension (1 cycle equals 8 meetings, 1 meeting per week).

 In the next stage, the bruxism episodes index will be re-evaluated using the Bruxoff device and pain intensity with the NRS scale and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.

 Also sleep quality and insomnia symptoms will be re-assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS).

 Evaluation of Biofeedback Therapy Efficiency in Sleep Bruxism and Masticatory Muscles Pain Management@highlight

This study evaluates beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in reducing pain and increased tension of masticatory muscles occurring in patients with sleep bruxism.

 During the study two functions of Biofeedback will be used: Functional Electro Stimulation (FES) delivering stimulation to relax masseter muscles and Electromyography Biofeedback (EMG-Biofeedback)- assisted training lowering the masseter muscle tension.

 The experimental group consists of adult subjects with sleep bruxism and masticatory muscles pain will be join to 8 meetings of FES and EMG-Biofeedback - assisted training and than compared to the control group consists of randomly enrolled adult subjects .
