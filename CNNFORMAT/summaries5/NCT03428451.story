(secondQuint)Treatment Versus Prophylaxis Against TURP Syndrome: Role Of Hypertonic Saline.

 TURP remains the surgical gold standard for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is the most common surgical procedure performed on male patients over 60 years of age.

 During TURP the wide plexus of venous sinuses is often opened.

 Non-conductive irrigation fluid is required during the use of monopolar electric resectoscope to clear the operating field.

 This hypotonic, electrolyte-free, nonconductive distension solution contains no electrolytes, and excessive absorption of it can cause fluid overload and dilutional hyponatremia.

 This study will be conducted on 60 patients ASA class I - III BPH patients, candidates for TURP surgery using the monopolar electric resectoscope.

 patients will be allocated into one of three study groups(n=20 in each).

 Group A patients will receive NaCl 3% (hypertonic saline) at a dose of 4 ml/kg/hr; Group B patients will receive NaCl 3% (hypertonic saline) at a dose of 2 ml/kg/hr; while group C patients will receive NaCl 0.

9% (normal saline) at a dose of 6 ml/kg/hr.

 All intra-venous infusions will be started 30 minutes before the subarachnoid block, and continued all through the procedure at the same rate.

 Hemodynamic parameters, s.

 sodium and osmolality, incidence of TUR syndrome, the need of hypertonic saline for treatment of hyponatraemia and need for ICU admission will be recorded.

The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline in BPH patients, candidates for TURP surgery using the monopolar electric resectoscope in prevention of hyponatraemia and TUR syndrome.
