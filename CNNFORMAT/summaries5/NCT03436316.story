(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Study Drug Absorption to the Blood After Administration of Single Ascending Doses of AZD8154 in Healthy Subjects.

.

 This is a Phase 1 Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AZD8154 Following Single Ascending Dose Administration in Healthy Subjects.

 This study will have 3 parts (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3).

 Part 1 of this study consists of six cohorts, each consisting of 8 subjects, will participate in Part 1 of the study.

 One dose level (e.

g.

, Cohort 5) will be repeated using the same formulation of AZD8154 but with a larger particle size.

 The selected cohort will be dosed at the same dose level with a larger particle size after a minimum washout period of 7 to 14 days between each dose administration.

 Depending on emerging data, a new cohort may be enrolled to repeat the dose level with the larger particle size of AZD8154.

 In addition, 1 to 2 additional cohorts may be added to test additional dose levels at the discretion of the Sponsor.

 Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive AZD8154 and 2 subjects randomized to receive placebo.

 Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel cohort, such that 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo and 1 subject will be randomized to receive AZD8154.

 The safety data from the sentinel subjects up to 24 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the principal investigator (PI) before the remaining subjects in the cohort are dosed.

 The remaining 6 subjects for each cohort will be dosed at least 48 hours after the sentinel cohort.

 Part 1 of the study will comprise of: a screening period of maximum 28 days; a treatment period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the day before Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 3, and a Follow-up Visit within 6 1 days after the (last) IMP dose.

 After completion of pivotal dose findings in Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 of the study will be initiated.

 In Part 2 of this study, one cohort consisting of 6 subjects will be enrolled.

 One subject in a sentinel cohort will be dosed first (intravenous (IV) dosing) and the safety data from the sentinel subject up to 24 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the PI before the remaining subjects in the cohort are dosed.

 The remaining 5 subjects in this cohort will be dosed at least 48 hours after the sentinel cohort.

 No sentinel dosing will be done in the inhaled dosing period.

 All subjects will receive AZD8154 IV in Treatment Period 1 and then after washout, receive inhaled AZD8154 in Treatment Period 2.

 Part 2 of the study will comprise of: a screening period of maximum 28 days; two treatment periods during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the day before IMP administration (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 3, and a follow-up visit within 6 1 days after last dose of IMP.

 There will be a minimum washout period of 7 to 14 days between each IMP administration.

 The duration of the washout period is based on the predicted half-life of AZD8154 and was selected to diminish the impact of carry-over effects from the first treatment period.

 In Part 3 of this study, one cohort consisting of 36 subjects will be randomized.

 All subjects will be dosed once with inhaled AZD8154 and once with inhaled placebo.

 Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences.

 Part 3 of the study will comprise of: a screening period of maximum 28 days; two treatment periods during which subjects attend the Clinical Unit 3 to 7 days before IMP administration for the collection of sputum.

 Thereafter subjects will return to the Clinical Unit, the day before IMP administration (Day -1) and will be resident at the Clinical Unit until at least 24 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 2; and a follow-up visit within 6 1 days after last dose of IMP.

 There will be a minimum washout period of 7 to 14 days between each dose administration.

 The duration of the washout period is based on the predicted half-life of AZD8154 and was selected to diminish the impact of carry-over effects from the first treatment period.

 The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) assessment will be performed in Part 1 of the study.

 The DLCO assessments will be performed in Part 2 and Part 3, only if emerging data in Part 1 indicates that it is needed.

 Post-dose DLCO will only be performed if a reduction is observed in FEV1 or FVC ( 12%) up to 24 hours after IMP administration.

@highlight

This study will be a Phase 1, first in human (FiH) study, consisting of 3 parts (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3) in healthy male and female subjects of non-childbearing potential, performed at a single study center.

 Part 1 of this study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) in healthy non-smoking male and female subjects of non-childbearing potential.

 Six dose levels of AZD8154 are planned to be investigated.

 Depending on emerging data, 1 to 2 additional dose levels may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor.

 Furthermore, one dose level will be repeated using the same formulation of AZD8154 but with a larger particle size (Part 1 only).

 Part 2 of this study will be a single cohort, open-label, crossover study in healthy non-smoking male and female subjects of non-childbearing potential, to compare a single inhaled dose of AZD8154 with a single IV dose of AZD8154.

 Part 3 of this study will be a single cohort, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in healthy smoking male and female subjects of non-childbearing potential, to compare the effect of a single dose of AZD8154 to a single dose of placebo in regard to sputum PIP3 fraction.
