(fifthQuint)Impact of Providing Medical Records in a Patient-Centered, Community Pharmacy Based, HIV Care Model (HIV-MOI).

 This study examines HIV medication optimization (HIV-MOI) in a prospective, randomized (1:1 HIV-MOI: standard of care), clinical trial, comparing disease-specific clinical and humanistic outcomes in 200 adult African-Americans with HIV (1:1 men: women) and either diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) and/or hypertension (HTN) (Figure 4) Data will be collected from individual participants for a 2 year period with enrollment expected to be completed within 2 years.

 Further details on recruitment, consenting, enrollment, randomization, data collection and data safety monitoring are in Data Management and Statistical Analysis Plans section.

 Beginning in year 2 of the project, enrollment will commence.

 Once properly screened, consented and enrolled, medical records from participant's medical provider(s) will be obtained.

 Upon receipt of the medical records at the pharmacy, the study coordinator (working closely with the project biostatistician) will provide only records belonging to those participants randomized to receive HIV-MOI to the pharmacist.

 The HIV-MOI pharmacists then assess the information and then analyze the clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of the current medical plan's medications.

 Upon completion, the pharmacist will develop a prioritized medication problem list, create a plan, discussed/collaborated with the medical provider/healthcare team member and then set up an initial HIV-MOI visit with the patient.

 At the initial visit, an individualized care plan would be implemented.

 Also at the initial HIV-MOI visit, the patient receives an accurate (and reconciled with medical providers) personal medication record (PMR) (Figure 3).

 Participants also receive an individualized care plan called a medication action plan (MAP) (Figure 3).

 The MAP can include non-pharmacological instructions and education and guided in part by data obtained in year 1 of Aim 2.

 Follow-up visits will occur not less than quarterly (more frequent visits may be clinically indicated).

 Follow-up visits may occur face-to-face or using telecommunication methods (phone, Skype, Face Time, etc.

).

 Research study coordinator, a trained professional with experience in medical chart review, will extract clinical data from the medical information for both intervention and control groups.

 The pharmacist will only be provided the medical information for the intervention group.

 Standard of care for pharmacists is not having access to medical information when providing HIV-MOI.

 Extracted data will be entered into study database.

 Impact of Providing Medical Records in a Patient-Centered, Community Pharmacy Based, HIV Care Model (HIV-MOI)@highlight

This is a clinical trial.

 The purpose of this clinical trial is to see if study participants have better health outcomes if their pharmacist has access to their medical records.

 The study will take place at a Walgreens community pharmacy in Dallas, Texas.

 The trial will enroll adult, African-Americans with HIV.

 They must also have diabetes, high blood pressure or both.

 Study participants will agree to have their medical records from all of their health providers released to UNTHSC.

 UNTHSC will provide the Walgreens pharmacist the medical records for half of the participants.

 Using the medical records, the pharmacist will provide 'enhanced' patient counseling services to half of the participants.

 This enhanced service is called 'medication optimization'.

 For the half of participants that the pharmacist does not see the medical records, they will receive usual and customary patient counseling.

 Not seeing the medical records is considered standard of care.

 In both groups, the counseling frequency will be based on the participant's needs but the pharmacist will contact every participant to check on them at least every 90 days.

 These visits will happen for 2 years.

 The groups will be compared to see if those participants having medication optimization have better health than those getting routine patient counseling.
