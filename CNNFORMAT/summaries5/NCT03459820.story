(fifthQuint)18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Prostate Cancer.

 Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the differences in theoretical optimal clinical management afforded by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer patients as proposed by a central panel of experts.

 Primary endpoint: 1.

 Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical, histopathological, biochemical and radiographic subject data both before and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging retrospectively by a central panel of experts.

 Secondary endpoints: 1.

 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan positivity fraction in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, stratified by PSA.

 2.

 Immediate AE up to 90 minutes post-administration of 18F-DCFPyL.

 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Prostate Cancer@highlight

This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase III trial in patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer.

 Patients will receive regular standard of clinical care.

 The only study-specific procedures will the administration of 18F-DCFPyL followed by a PET/CT scan.

 Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical, biochemical and radiographic subject data before and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging by a central panel of experts will be captured at study completion.
