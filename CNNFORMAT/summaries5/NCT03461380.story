 We hypothesize that Menopause Relief EP-40 (a fixed combination of Cimicifuga EP-40 and Rhodiola EPR-7 extracts) will significantly relieve menopausal complaints such as hot flushes, profuse sweating hot flushes, excessive perspiration, night sweats, sleep disorders, nervousness, mood swings, physical and mental fatigue as compared to EP-40(R) capsules or placebo in adult females in menopause.
