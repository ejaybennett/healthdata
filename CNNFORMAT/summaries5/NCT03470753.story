(fifthQuint)Impact of Home Exercise Delivery on Compliance & Outcomes for Musculoskeletal Pain.

 Patients seeking care for their chronic low back or knee pain will be recruited to participate in a trial investigating the value of different exercise and education prescription strategies as well as strategies to determine the influence of various exercise reminder strategies.

 On day 1 of enrollment, patients will be randomized and instructed in two different types and amounts of exercises, as well as two types of delivery strategies.

 The ability to recall and perform these exercises will be assessed 20 minutes after completion of the instructional period (retention).

 In phase 2, patients will be randomized to receive different reminder strategies (none, email, text, and/or video) and their compliance assessed over a 1 month period (compliance).

 Self-reported compliance over the first month, and health care utilization outcomes will be analyzed for the 1 year following completion of the 1 month period, in all groups.

 Impact of Home Exercise Delivery on Compliance & Outcomes for Musculoskeletal Pain@highlight

Patients seeking care for chronic low back or knee pain will be recruited for enrollment, and randomized within two phases (retention and compliance).

 Patients will consent to a 2-step study design, with independent randomization for each.

 The initial step will assess retention based on 4 different exercise prescription strategies.

 This will be assessed short-term, and then the 2nd step will consist of a second independent randomization to receive different reminder strategies to determine their influence on exercise compliance at home.
