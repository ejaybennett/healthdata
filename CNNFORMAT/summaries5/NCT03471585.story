(firstQuint)Effects of THC on Emotional Memory Retrieval.

 Here, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of THC (15 mg) on the retrieval of negative, neutral, and positive memories.

 The study used a placebo-controlled, within-subjects, crossover design with 23 participants.

 In each experimental arm, participants attend a session to encode stimuli and a second session 48 hours later in which their memories are tested for the stimuli from the first session.

 In the second session, two hours prior to memory testing, THC or placebo is administered.

 On all sessions subjects complete mood questionnaires.
