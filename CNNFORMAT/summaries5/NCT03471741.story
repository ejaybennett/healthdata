(firstQuint)Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy With Concomitant Boost in Breast Cancer.

 Patients treated conservatively with moderate-high risk breast cancer were treated with IMRT plus concomitant boost to surgical bed (up to a dose of 50 Gy to whole breast and 60 Gy to the tumor bed).

 Aim of the study was to evaluate late toxicity and local control after this treatment compared with a historical control group (CG) of patients treated with 3D-conformal postoperative radiotherapy delivered with conventional fractionation.
