(firstQuint)Cigarette Harm Reduction With Scheduled Electronic Cigarette Use.

 Daily cigarette smokers who are familiar with e-cigarette (EC) use will be instructed to use only NIDA Standardized Research Electronic Cigarettes (SREC) and tobacco cigarettes (TC) while enrolled on the study.

 The overall goals are two-fold: (1) to compare nicotine and toxicant exposure and pharmacological effects of SREC used alone vs tobacco cigarettes (TC); and (2) using scheduled SREC use combined with ad libitum TC use as a model for dual use, to examine the extent to which nicotine and toxicant exposure and biomarkers of potential harm compare with dual use vs TC alone use.

 The former would inform the effects of total switching, the latter would inform the potential harm reducing effects of smoking fewer TC while using EC.

This is an observational, crossover study that will be examine use behaviors, chemical exposures, and biological effects of SREC compared to TC use in subjects confined to a research ward setting.
