(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate Safety, PK, PD, Immunogenicity & Antitumor Activity of MSC-1 in Patients With Adv Solid Tumors.

 MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

 LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in many physiological and pathological processes including the promotion of an immunosuppressive environment.

 In cancer, it is hypothesized that LIF expressing malignancies co-opt this activity, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as well as promoting the activity of cancer-initiating cell(s) (CICs).

 LIF is highly expressed in a subset of tumors across multiple solid tumor types.

 During dose escalation, patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be treated with MSC-1 with the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of MSC-1 and defining an appropriate dose for further evaluation in dose expansion.

 MSC-1 will be administered intravenously (IV) until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or study termination.

 In dose expansion, up to 4 parallel cohorts of patients with LIF-High tumors (NSCLC, Ovarian Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer), and a cohort of mixed Solid Tumors (referred to as the "basket cohort"), may be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of MSC-1.

 Study to Evaluate Safety, PK, PD, Immunogenicity & Antitumor Activity of MSC-1 in Patients With Adv Solid Tumors@highlight

This is a 2-part study to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of MSC-1.

 MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.

 In part 1, multiple dose levels of MSC-1 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be studied to determine the recommended dose for further evaluation of safety and efficacy in Part 2.
