(firstQuint)Analgesic Effect of Different Positions and Canulae on Medial Branch Radiofrequency Denervation for Lumbar Zygapophyseal Joint Pain.

 Patients who suffer from lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain often receive radiofrequency medial branch denervation as treatment.

 Many types if canulae exist, and many types of placing them in relation to the Medial Branch nerves (MB).

 The EARL study tries to compare the analgesic effect of thin canulae (22 gauge) placed perpendicular to MB to thicker canulae (18 gauge) placed parallel to MB.
