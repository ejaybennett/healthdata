(secondQuint)Imaging Activated Macrophages in the Lungs.

 Investigators intend to enroll patients who are undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules from the Vanderbilt lung nodule evaluation clinic, including 30 patients with COPD and 15 non-smokers without COPD.

 Folate imaging will be performed with 68Ga-EC2115 prior to scheduled bronchoscopy, which will be performed for clinical purposes to evaluate a suspicious lung nodule.

 The unused portion of the bronchoalveolar lavage (not necessary for clinical purposes), will be interrogated to compare PET imaging with parameters of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

 In addition, PET imaging data will be compared with disease severity based on pulmonary function testing.

To test whether folate-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 68Ga-EC2115 can differentiate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients from control subjects and determine whether the PET signal correlates with measurements of inflammation and disease severity.
