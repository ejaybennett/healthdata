(firstQuint)VitamIn and oXygen Interventions and Cardiovascular Events.

 Adult patients with risk factors for developing postoperative cardiac complications will be enrolled in the study.

 The patients will be randomised to receiving antioxidants or placebo perioperatively and 30% or 80% inspiratory oxygen concentration during anaesthesia and 2 hours postoperatively.

 The primary outcome is MINS (myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery).

 The antioxidants are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) 3 grams intravenously preoperatively and N-acetylcysteine 100 milligrams/kilogram body weight intravenous infusion for 4 hours, starting at the same time as anaesthesia.
