(firstQuint)Terminal Latency Index, Residual Latency and Median Ulnar F Latency Difference in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

 Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy.

 This study was performed to determine the value of terminal latency index, residual latency and median ulnar F latency difference to investigate their sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of this syndrome.

 We retrospectively determined the 160 patients.

 We evaluated the nerve conduction studies of patient and healthy arms.

 We recorded all nerve conduction study values.
