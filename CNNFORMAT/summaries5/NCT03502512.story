(fifthQuint)Prospective Comparison of Methods to Process Autologous Fat Grafts in Breast Reconstruction.

 Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of the dice) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 - If participant is in Group 1, participant's tissue will be processed by REVOLVE cent .

 In this method, the tissue is washed with a medical solution and spun at low speed to filter the tissue and separate the fat tissue from other fluid before it is transplanted.

 - If participant is in Group 2, participant's tissue will be processed by PureGraftTM.

 This process uses a system of filters to wash fatty tissue with a medical solution and separate fat tissue from other fluid before it is transplanted.

 Participant has an equal chance (50/50) of being assigned to either group.

 Both participant and the study doctor will know to which group participant has been assigned.

 Surgery: After participant has been assigned to a study group, participant will be scheduled for reconstructive surgery as part of participant's standard care.

 Participant will sign a separate consent that explains the surgery in more detail, including its risks.

 During participant's surgery, a member of the study staff will watch the surgeon and the surgical staff as they perform the surgery.

 They will record the amount of fat that was used in each step during the surgery.

 After the fatty tissue is removed, it will be processed according to the group participant has been assigned and placed back into participant's body during reconstructive surgery.

 During the surgery, participant's surgeon may decide to use a different tissue processing method than what participant was originally assigned.

 If this happens, participant will still be able to take part in this study and participant's surgery will be performed in the standard way.

 Follow-up: After participant's surgery, participant will have follow-up visits as part of participant's standard care at about 2-4 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and then 1 time each year for up to 3 years after participant's surgery.

 At each visit: - Photographs will be taken and compared to the pre-operative photographs to learn if the amount of fat in the reconstruction has changed over time.

 - Participant will complete a questionnaire about participant's level of satisfaction with participant's reconstruction and a survey about participant's level of satisfaction with participant's appearance and body changes resulting from participant's cancer treatment.

 This should take about 10-12 minutes to complete both.

 Participant may also have imaging scans, an ultrasound, and/or a mammogram, performed as part of participant's standard care.

 If these scans are performed, the results will be collected from participant's medical record.

 Any photographs taken throughout participant's participation may possibly be used for future research.

 Length of Participation: Participation on this study will be over after participant completes 3 years of follow-up visits.

 Prospective Comparison of Methods to Process Autologous Fat Grafts in Breast Reconstruction@highlight

During breast reconstructive surgery that uses autologous fat grafting (AFG, transplanting fat tissue from one part of participant's body to another), fat tissue is removed from the body (usually the abdomen, buttock, or thighs) and injected into another part of the body.

 This tissue must be "processed" (sometimes referred to as "washed" or "prepared") before being inserted back into the body.

 In this study, 2 different types of tissue processing methods (REVOLVE and PureGraft) will be compared.

 The goal of this clinical research study is to collect data on the amount of fat that is absorbed by participant's body over time after surgery.

 Researchers also want to learn about the outcomes of any complications and overall patient satisfaction.

 This is an investigational study.

 The REVOLVE cent and PureGraft cent techniques are both FDA approved and commercially available.

 Up to 110 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
