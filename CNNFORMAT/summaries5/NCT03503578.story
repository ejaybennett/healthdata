(thirdQuint)EEG Studies of Sevoflurane-Induced General Anesthesia.

 During this research study, participants will receive sevoflurane, and sevoflurane and ketamine together, at a high enough dose to induce general anesthesia (make study participants "fall asleep").

 During one visit participants will receive only sevoflurane; during another visit participants will be given both sevoflurane and ketamine together.

 The investigators will record EEG the entire time.

 The investigators will also ask some questions related to pain and cognitive function.

 EEG Studies of Sevoflurane-Induced General Anesthesia@highlight

The investigators are performing this research study to find out how and where the anesthetic drugs sevoflurane and ketamine act in the brain.

 Sevoflurane and ketamine are anesthetics (a drug or agent used to decrease or eliminate the feeling of pain by causing unconsciousness).

 The investigators will study the brain using a machine that records the brain's electrical activity, called an electroencephalogram (EEG).
