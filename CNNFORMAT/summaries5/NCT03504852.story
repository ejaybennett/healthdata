 A 52-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in approximately 330 subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis of body weight 90 kg or higher at time of randomization.

 The study consists of 4 periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), treatment Period 1 (16 weeks), treatment Period 2 (36 weeks), and post-treatment follow-up (8 weeks).

 Subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to the following groups: Secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks; Secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.

 In addition, subjects from the 300 mg every 4 weeks group who do not achieve PASI 90 response at Week 16 will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either remain on secukinumab 300 mg every 4 weeks or receive secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks starting at Week 16, until the end of treatment.
