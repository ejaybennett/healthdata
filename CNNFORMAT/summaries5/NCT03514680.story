(secondQuint)Evaluating a Clinician Support Algorithm to Enhance Implementation of Evidence-Based Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment and Management Recommendations.

 This research study will test a new clinician decision support tool for the assessment and management of CIPN.

 The algorithm is designed to help clinicians make decisions about which strategies to use for the assessment and/or management of CIPN.

 The investigators need to recruit participants receiving chemotherapy that is known to cause CIPN to determine how well the algorithm works to increase clinicians' use of recommended CIPN assessment and management strategies.
