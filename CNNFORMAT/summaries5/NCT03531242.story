(secondQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis (VEE) Vaccine as Booster Vaccine in Adults.

 Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis Vaccine, Inactivated, Dried, C-84, TSI-GSD 205, Lot 7, Run 1, to be administered as dose(s) of 0.

5 mL given subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect of the triceps area.

 Subjects who showed an initial immune response 1:20 to TC-83 and whose titer decreased over time or who rollover from a previous VEE C-84 protocol will receive a single 0.

5 mL booster dose of C-84 vaccine.

 Subjects who were initial non-responders (1:20 at 1 year; if not, the vaccination procedure with C-84 will be repeated with a minimum of 28 days between doses.

 A maximum of four booster doses will be given in a year.

 If the PRNT80 titer is 30 days), and, if required, the subject will be given a booster dose of C-84 vaccine.

 Safety endpoint measurements will be evaluated for all subjects receiving at least one vaccination under this protocol regardless of compliance with the protocol.

 Immunogenicity endpoints will be evaluated for subjects who have been vaccinated in compliance with the protocol and who have had blood for titers drawn in compliance with the protocol.
