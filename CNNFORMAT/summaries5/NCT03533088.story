(thirdQuint)Scapular Kinematic Changes on Patients With Rotator Cuff Repair.

 Rotator Cuff (RC) muscles are primary dynamic stabilizers of shoulder joint.

 Therefore, the repair of rotator cuff ruptures is a common procedure.

 The primarly goals of the post-surgical rehabilitation are gaining normal ranges of glenohumeral joint and restoring the kinematics of shoulder girdle.

 The scapular stabilization exercises are important fuatures of this process because scapulo-thoracic joint very important for normal kinematics of glenohumeral joint and RC muscles.

 Yet, little is known about the scapular orientations after RC repair surgerys.

 The aim of the study is to investigate mid-term changes in scapular kinematics after RC repair surgery.

 Scapular Kinematic Changes on Patients With Rotator Cuff Repair@highlight

Rotator cuff muscles are originates from the scapula and they are primarly responsible for the dynamic stabilization of glenohumeral joint.

 Optimal scapulo-humeral rythm is needed for their optimal functioning.

 However; after surgeries of rotator cuff tears little is know about the scapulo-humeral rythm is restored or not.

 The aim of the study is to investigate changes in scapular kinematics after rotator cuff repair surgery.
