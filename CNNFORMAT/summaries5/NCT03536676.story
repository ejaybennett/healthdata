 The investigators propose an 8-week parallel design breakfast study in children enrolled in 6-8th grade within the Center School District in the Kansas City, Missouri.

 This school will begin their 'Breakfast in the Classroom' program on March 26, 2018.

 Prior to the start of 'Breakfast in the Classroom', baseline data will be collected on the students who wish to participate in the study.

 Baseline data includes anthropometric assessments; demographics; current eating habits; cognitive performance; appetite; and mood.

 Following baseline, the students will be provided 1 of 2 breakfasts for 8-weeks: 'Breakfast in the Classroom' or the 'Egg-cellent Breakfast in the Classroom.

' At 4 weeks, the study participants will complete a sub-set of baseline outcomes.

 At the end of the 8-week period, similar outcomes (to that of baseline) will be completed.
