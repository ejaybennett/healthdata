(secondQuint)A Phase 1 Study of Voruciclib in Subjects With B-Cell Malignancies.

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, 3 + 3 dose escalation study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of voruciclib in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies after treatment with standard therapy.

 There will be up to 5 dose level cohorts.

 Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled per dose cohort and dose escalation will be allowed after 3 subjects have completed 1 cycle with no reported dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or 6 subjects completed 1 cycle with no more than 1 DLT.

 Escalation to the next higher dose level will depend on demonstrated safety and tolerability.

 Subjects may continue to receive voruciclib while there is evidence of clinical benefit and acceptable toxicity as judged by the investigator.
