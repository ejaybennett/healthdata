(fifthQuint)BIO REsponse Adapted Combination Therapy Pilot Study.

 The REACT treatment concept aims at minimizing the metal burden, combining Passeo-18 Lux Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) with Pulsar-18 thin struts bare metal stent, as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), while benefiting from the antirestenotic properties of Paclitaxel.

 However, in order to optimally apply this selective stenting approach, it is needed to clearly identify when a stent is indicated.

 Angiographic images, even with additional projections, are sometimes insufficient to clearly determine if a dissection is flow-limiting and the subsequent stent requirement.

 There is currently no definition nor validated method to define flow-limiting dissection in the peripheral arteries.

 Even though it has been widely used, the classification developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to grade coronary artery dissection as A to F19, based on angiographic appearance cannot be extrapolated to peripheral arteries.

 Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the incremental value of several adjunctive procedural assessments to standard angiography to identify flow-limiting dissection and residual stenosis, and better inform the operator on the stent requirement.

 In addition, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the REACT algorithm.

Both drug-coated balloon and stents have been used for a number of years to treat subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and are recognized as very good treatment methods.

 However, due to a higher risk of blood clot formation, requiring a longer anticoagulant treatment, and the challenge of treating re growth of tissue extending through the metal mesh of the stent, the physicians try to reserve stent placement to situation where it's really needed, in case of flow-limiting vessel dissection or acute re-narrowing.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of several procedural diagnostic techniques in helping the physicians to better decide whether a stent is needed or not.

 The study will also estimate the safety and efficacy of Passeo-18 Lux drug-coated balloon associated to Pulsar 18 bare metal stent when and where needed to treat PAD
