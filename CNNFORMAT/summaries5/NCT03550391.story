(fifthQuint)Stereotactic Radiosurgery Compared With Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) for 5-15 Brain Metastases.

 The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good or bad) of receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus a drug called memantine, on brain metastases.

 Receiving SRS could control cancer that has spread to the brain.

 This study will allow the researchers to know whether this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach.

 To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) helps to either slow the growth of cancer or stop it from coming back, compared to the usual approach.

 Doctors will also look to see if this new approach increases the life span of patients with this type of cancer, and if it helps with quality of life and cancer related symptoms.

 The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is treatment with whole brain radiation therapy alone (WBRT).

 Stereotactic Radiosurgery Compared With Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) for 5-15 Brain Metastases@highlight

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a commonly used treatment for brain tumors.

 It is a one-day (or in some cases two day), out-patient procedure during which a high dose of radiation is delivered to small spots in the brain while excluding the surrounding normal brain.

 Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is when radiation therapy is given to the whole brain.

 Memantine is a drug that is given to help relieve symptoms that can be caused by WBRT, including problems with memory and other mental symptoms.

 Health Canada, the regulatory body that oversees the use of drugs in Canada, has not approved the sale or use of memantine in combination with WBRT to treat this kind of cancer, although they have allowed its use in this study.
