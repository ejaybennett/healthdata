(thirdQuint)The Impact of Anti-thrombosis on Cerebral Microbleeds and Intracranial Hemorrhage in Ischemic Stroke Patients.

 Cerebral microbleeds(CMBs) is a subclinical lesion caused by microvascular disease in the brain, characterized by microleakage of blood.

 About 30% of ischemic stroke patients, 40% of the healthy people over 80 years old, and 60% of intracranial hemorrhage patients have microbleeds.

 With the development of imaging technology, clinically more and more patients have found microbleeds in the brain.

 How these patients are treated with antithrombotic drugs is not yet clear and is in urgent need of evidence.

 There are only a few prospective cohort studies to determine whether antithrombotic therapy increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with CMBs, but the results are uncertain.

 More importantly, whether antithrombotic therapy increases the incidence of the emerging CMBs, and whether the change of increased microbleeds is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage has not been reported.

The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to investigate whether antithrombotic therapy in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke increases the risk of the emerging CMBs and whether the change is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, providing an imaging evidence for individualized antithrombotic therapy in such patients.
