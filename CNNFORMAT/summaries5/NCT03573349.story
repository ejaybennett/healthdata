(thirdQuint)Glutamate MRS During Ketamine Infusion.

 Aims: This feasibility study aims to better understand the neurobiology of major depression and how ketamine may therapeutically impact brain function.

 This research may provide important insights into the mechanism of ketamine response, thus, potentially increasing the likelihood of successful treatment interventions and decrease the number of ineffective treatments and/or risk for serious side effects.

 SPECIFIC AIMS: Primary aim: Evaluate change in central glutamate (i.

e.

 MR spectroscopic CSF corrected glutamate in ACC) and peripheral glutamate (i.

e.

 high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] measured glutamate) after a single 40-minute infusion of i.

v.

 racemic ketamine, and change in symptoms of depression measured using MADRS scale in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (baseline to 24 hours) (n=10).

 Glutamate MRS During Ketamine Infusion@highlight

This is a feasibility study and the goal of this project is to evaluate whether ACC glutamine, quantified as a CSF-corrected absolute concentration percent change from baseline, is associated with clinical remission, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of =9, to the anti-glutamatergic antidepressant ketamine.

 As MRS is expensive, we also aim to study a correlation between peripheral glutamate and central glutamate level.
