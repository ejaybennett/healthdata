(fifthQuint)Treatment With Leflunomide in Patients With Polymyalgia Rheumatica.

 Over the last decades outcome has greatly improved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA).

 This is in sharp contrast to the situation for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), with a lifetime prevalence of 2.

4% for women and 1.

7% for men, PMR is the commonest auto-inflammatory musculoskeletal disease in adults aged 50 years.

 Due to population ageing, the number of PMR patients will likely double in the decades to come (CBS).

 Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment.

 However, there is an unmet medical need of alternatives in the treatment of PMR as 50% of patients will relapse or have difficulties to reduce the corticosteroid doses.

 Also, there is increasing awareness of steroid related toxicity and in addition, long-term toxicity is a well-known side-effect of glucocorticoids in PMR.

 Low dose methotrexate ( 5 mg/L) Is called a relapse if it was observed during steroid tapering, and is called a Recurrence if it was observed after steroid withdrawal.

 Criteria for remission Patient global 3/ 10 or less and Physician global 1/10 or less and A normal CRP ( < 5 mg/L) Secondary outcome measure PMR-AS The PMR-AS (Leeb and Bird) is a composite score with the following items: Physician global, Pt global, CRP, ability to raise the shoulders on examination, and duration of morning stiffness in minutes.

 This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess: 1.

 Time to relapse and steroid-sparing capacity of leflunomide 2.

 PMR disease activity including patient reported outcome 3.

 Treatment related complications of steroids 4.

 Safety and tolerability of leflunomide This blinded RCT in PMR is a unique study involving 5 centres in 4 different countries.

 It is the first study to use the recently developed consensus and outcome criteria in PMR which were developed by multidisciplinary groups including patients input.

 It is both timely and needed to fund a study in PMR since due to ageing in especially Western Europe the expectancy is that the incidence and prevalence of PMR will increase in the coming years.

 In brief: It is time to take PMR seriously and treat the patients with steroid sparing agents in order to prevent co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis in an ageing population.

 The 5 centres (Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Medical University Graz, Department of Rheumatology, Hospital of Southern Norway Trust Kristiansand, Kristiansand, Norway, The Department of Rheumatology, Southend University Hospital, Westcliff-on-sea, Chapel Allerton Hospital and St James's University Hospital Leeds and the University Medical Centre Groningen) participating in this study also set up an immediate early access outpatient clinic for PMR patients.

 We will keep close contact with patients and their organizations to check whether our aims are in line with their expectations.

 The relevance and gain for patients will be a different approach to PMR on the level of - Early recognition/ making an appropriate diagnosis - Starting steroid sparing treatment in an adequate dose at baseline - Better outcome and earlier control of PMR with less relapses and cumulative dosis of steroids (benefit of thight control).

 Our study can provide substantial benefit to the society.

 We seek to demonstrate that relatively cheap drug like leflunomide can improve the treatment of these PMR patients and limit the occurrence of relapses and GC-related side effects.

 Since leflunomide is an old and cheap drug the pharmaceutical companies are not interested in funding, we hope therefore that the Dutch Arthritis Association will fund our study.

 Treatment With Leflunomide in Patients With Polymyalgia Rheumatica@highlight

Over the last decades outcome has greatly improved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA).

 This is in sharp contrast to the situation for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), with a lifetime prevalence of 2.

4% for women and 1.

7% for men, PMR is the commonest auto-inflammatory musculoskeletal disease in adults aged 50 years.

 Due to population ageing, the number of PMR patients will likely double in the decades to come (CBS).

 Glucocorticoids (GC) are the mainstay of treatment.

 However, there is an unmet medical need of alternatives in the treatment of PMR as 50% of patients will relapse or have difficulties to reduce the corticosteroid doses.

 Also, there is increasing awareness of steroid related toxicity and in addition, long-term toxicity is a well-known side-effect of glucocorticoids in PMR.

 Low dose methotrexate (< 10 mg per week) has been tested in two blinded randomized control trials and 4 open label studies and has shown low to moderate efficacy as corticosteroid-sparing agent.

 Studies on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers yielded negative results.

 The effectiveness of leflunomide has only been convincingly demonstrated in case series.

 The high rate of relapses and adverse events in steroid treated patients indicate that alternative adjuvant agents are needed.

 There is evidence that leflunomide could serve as steroid sparing agent and that leflunomide can be used to prevent relapses in the clinical management of polymyalgia rheumatica.

 We will perform a randomized placebo controlled trial.

 Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio receiving either leflunomide 20 mg once daily + glucocorticoids , or placebo + glucocorticoids.
