(fifthQuint)Benapenem PK Phase Ib Multiple-dose Study.

 A single-center, randomized, open-label, three-period and three-crossover trial design is adopted in the single-dose pharmacokinetic study.

 Twelve healthy adult volunteers, half male and female, are enrolled and randomly assigned to three groups, B1, B2, and B3.

 The subjects in three groups receive three doses, 250 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg.

 Each group of subjects receive single-dose test drug at different dosages in each period.

 A single-center, randomized, open- label, and dose escalation trial design is used in the multiple-dose tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies.

 The tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies are performed simultaneously.

 Two doses, 250 mg and 500 mg, are proposed for multiple-dose tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies.

 The subjects are divided into two groups, C1 and C2, 12 subjects in each group, half males and half females.

 250 mg group is performed first.

 After completion of observation and confirming that the drug can be safely tolerated, study on 500 mg group is then performed.

 Each subject receives only one dose, intravenous drip, once daily, for 7 consecutive days.
