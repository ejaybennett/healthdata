(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage I, II, or IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Surgically Removed.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and etoposide after radical surgery in prolonging the relapse free and overall survival for stages I, II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

 OUTLINE: This a randomized study (treatment vs no treatment).

 Patients are stratified according to sex and to stage of disease (I vs II vs IIIA).

 Patient receives cisplatin and etoposide on days 1-3, every 28 days, for 3 cycles.

 Patient may receive radiation therapy after surgery at the discretion of the physician.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients will be accrued over 3 years.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare cisplatin and etoposide with no chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been surgically removed.
