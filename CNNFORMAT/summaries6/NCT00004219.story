(thirdQuint)Lerisetron Compared With Granisetron in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Men Being Treated With Radiation Therapy for Stage I Seminoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the efficacy and safety of lerisetron versus granisetron hydrochloride in the prevention of radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in men with stage I testicular seminoma.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, parallel, multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.

 Arm I: Patients receive oral lerisetron with an oral placebo once daily for 14 days.

 Arm II: Patients receive oral lerisetron once daily for 14 days.

 Arm III: Patients receive oral granisetron hydrochloride once daily for 14 days.

 At 1-2 hours following antiemetics, all patients undergo concurrent daily radiotherapy for at least 10 out of 14 days.

 Patients are followed daily for 10 days.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.

 Lerisetron Compared With Granisetron in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Men Being Treated With Radiation Therapy for Stage I Seminoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs may help to reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with radiation therapy.

 It is not yet known whether lerisetron is more effective than granisetron in preventing nausea and vomiting.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of lerisetron with that of granisetron in preventing nausea and vomiting in men who are being treated with radiation therapy for stage I seminoma.
