(firstQuint)Phase I Pilot Study of Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This a dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant adenovirus encoded with the ornithine transcarbamylase gene.

 Patients receive a single dose of virus infused into the liver under fluoroscopic guidance.

 Groups of 3 patients receive successively higher doses of virus; each cohort is observed for safety for 3 weeks before entry of the next group.

 Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, then every 3 months until stable.
