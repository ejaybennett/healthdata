(secondQuint)Genetic Study of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I Receptor Mutations in Patients With Intrauterine Growth Retardation.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood draw.

 Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) are measured.

 Patients whose IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels are average or above are tested for the presence of mutation in the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.

 Genetic Study of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I Receptor Mutations in Patients With Intrauterine Growth Retardation@highlight

OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if mutations in the gene encoding the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor lead to relative insulin-like growth factor-I insensitivity and produce intrauterine growth retardation in children.
