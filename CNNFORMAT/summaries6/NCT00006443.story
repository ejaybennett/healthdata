(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Who Have Not Received Previous Anti-HIV Drugs During Different Stages of HIV Infection.

 Recent advancements in antiretroviral therapy have led to a better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.

 To calculate the degree and duration of antiretroviral effect necessary to eliminate infection, characterization of residual cellular and tissue HIV reservoirs following high-level viral suppression is necessary.

 The ERADICATE study will evaluate the hypothesis that complete viral inhibition is possible, regardless of HIV disease stage, and leads to HIV eradication from tissues over time.

 Patients are divided into 1 of 5 groups based on the stage of HIV infection.

 Patients receive oral stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) twice daily for 24 weeks.

 All patients undergo basic blood sampling to follow HIV-1 RNA levels and absolute T cell subset numbers daily for 5 days; then 3 times a week for 3 weeks; 2 times a week for 4 weeks; every 2 weeks for 12 weeks; and monthly thereafter for a total of 3 years.

 In addition, the following tissues are sampled at baseline and after 2 weeks and 6 months on therapy: 1) lymph node; 2) tonsillar; 3) perirectal lymphoid; 4) cerebrospinal fluid; 5) and semen.

The purpose of this study is to compare changes in HIV levels and certain immune cells among patients at different stages of HIV infection.

 This study will also see how a combination of stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) affects these levels.

 Current findings in anti-HIV drug treatment have led to a greater understanding of the background of HIV.

 To find the best anti-HIV treatment to eliminate all HIV viruses, cells and tissues infected with the HIV virus are examined after combination anti-HIV treatment, when the level of HIV infection is low.

 The ERADICATE study will examine the idea that HIV viruses can be eliminated at any stage of infection over time.
