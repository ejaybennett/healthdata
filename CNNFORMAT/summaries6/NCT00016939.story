(secondQuint)Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses in patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with flavopiridol.

 - Determine the 6-month time to treatment failure rate and overall survival rate of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient population.

 - Determine, in a preliminary manner, the association of tumor response with pretreatment tumor proliferative and apoptotic rates in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Kidney Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic kidney cancer.
