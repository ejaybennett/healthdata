(firstQuint)Evaluation of the Safety of and Immune Response to an HIV Vaccine in Healthy Adults.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine strategy for HIV prophylaxis using a DNA-prime plus recombinant fowlpox boost.

 The DNA plasmid and fowlpox vector contain HIV genes.

 However, these vaccines contain only some HIV genes and cannot themselves cause HIV or AIDS.

 Eligible volunteers at low risk of HIV infection will be randomized to receive either active vaccine or placebo injections at Day 0, Week 4, and Week 8.

 Intensive immunologic and safety monitoring will be done during the first 16 weeks of the study.

 Follow-up will continue to Week 52.
