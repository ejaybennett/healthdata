(thirdQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Inoperable Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy results in acceptable local control (i.

e.

, 80%) in patients with medically inoperable stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - Determine treatment-related toxicity in patients treated with this therapy.

 - Determine disease-free survival, overall survival, and patterns of failure in patients treated with this therapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 8-14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months.

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with inoperable stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.
