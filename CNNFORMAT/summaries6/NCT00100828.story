(thirdQuint)Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Inoperable Thyroid Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or inoperable locoregional medullary thyroid cancer treated with irinotecan.

 Secondary - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Response is assessed after completion of 4 courses.

 Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR.

 Patients who have stable disease receive up to 12 total courses.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Inoperable Thyroid Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with metastatic or inoperable thyroid cancer.
