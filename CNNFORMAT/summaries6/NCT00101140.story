(fifthQuint)Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and antileukemia activity of haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in first remission.

 Secondary - Determine the early treatment-related mortality (before day 100) of patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Determine the incidence of graft failure in patients treated with this regimen.

 - Correlate a mismatch in the expression of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptors CD158a and CD158b with engraftment and disease recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive a preparative regimen comprising total-body irradiation twice on day -8; fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3; thiotepa IV over 2 hours twice on day -7; and antithymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -5 to -2.

 Patients undergo haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

 Patients are followed at day 100, at least monthly for 2 years, and then periodically for 3 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.

2 years.

 Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission@highlight

RATIONALE: A peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

 Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

 Giving total-body irradiation together with fludarabine, thiotepa, and antithymocyte globulin before transplant may stop this from happening.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission.
