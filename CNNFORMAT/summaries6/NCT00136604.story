(fifthQuint)Response to GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC Vacc (4th Dose) at 15-24m & Mencevax ACWY at 24-30m.

 This study will be conducted in two stages.

 In the DTP booster phase subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib (active control) at 15 to 24 months in a single-blind manner so that the subjects' parents will not know which vaccine was administered to their child (this booster phase is no longer recruiting).

 In the Mencevax cent ACWY phase at 24-30 months a dose of Mencevax cent ACWY will be given to subjects who were not boosted with a MenA conjugate and/or MenC containing vaccine at 15-24 months in an open manner (this booster phase is not yet recruiting).

 Up to four blood samples will be taken: before and one month after the administration of the DTP booster dose and of Mencevax cent ACWY.

 To comply with the immunisation calender of Thailand, at 15-24 months all subjects will receive OPV.

 At 16-25 months 2 doses of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine or a dose of varicella vaccine will be offered and at 25-31 months a dose of varicella or JE vaccine will be offered.

 Response to GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC Vacc (4th Dose) at 15-24m & Mencevax ACWY at 24-30m@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC compared to DTPw-HBV/Hib given to healthy subjects at 15 to 24 months of age primed with 3 doses of Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC in study 100480.

 Antibody persistence will be evaluated at 24 to 30 months.

 Immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a dose of Mencevax cent ACWY given at 24 to 30 months will also be evaluated when given to subjects not boosted with a MenA conjugate and/or MenC containing vaccine.
