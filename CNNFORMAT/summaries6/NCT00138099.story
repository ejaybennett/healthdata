(fifthQuint)Dalteparin's Influence on Renally Compromised: Anti-Ten-A Study (DIRECT).

 Critically ill patients who are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with an estimated 20-40% of patients developing DVT without prophylaxis.

 Preventing DVT is important because DVT is usually clinically silent in such patients, and its first manifestation may be life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

 About 30% of ICU patients have renal insufficiency, based on a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl), and such patients have 4-fold higher risk of DVT than those with normal renal function.

 The current anticoagulant regimen that is used to prevent DVT in such patients, consisting of unfractionated heparin (UFH), 5000 IU twice-daily, may be inadequate.

 A recent prospective cohort study by our research group that investigated the risk of DVT in 261 ICU patients found that 10% of patients developed proximal vein DVT after admission to the ICU despite receiving UFH, 5000 IU twice-daily.

 In other patient groups at high risk for DVT, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have replaced UFH for DVT prophylaxis because of superior efficacy.

 Despite superior efficacy and safety in many patients, there is concern about using LMWHs in patients with renal insufficiency because LMWHs are cleared by the kidney.

 LMWH use in such patients might result in an excessive anticoagulant effect, with the potential to increase bleeding.

 Much of the concern about the safety of LMWH in patients with renal insufficiency pertains to therapeutic-dose LMWH used to treat DVT.

 Prophylactic-(or low) dose LMWH that is used to prevent DVT in ICU patients is about 25-33% of a therapeutic-dose.

 Three sources of evidence suggest that prophylactic-dose LMWH may be safe in patients with renal insufficiency.

 First, current evidence does not support the fact that prophylactic-dose LMWH accumulates and should be avoided in such patients.

 Second, prophylactic-dose LMWH appears to be safe in hemodialysis patients.

 Third, preliminary work by our research group suggests that dalteparin, 5000 IU once-daily, does not accumulate in ICU patients with renal insufficiency.

 Thus, 0 of 10 ICU patients with a CrCl 0.

10 IU/mL).

 Further, when the relationship between CrCl and peak anti-Xa levels was assessed, there was no correlation (r0.

40 IU/mL is ~10% or less (exclude 17% with 95% confidence); - risk of major bleeding is ~4% or less (exclude 10% with 95% confidence).

 If we show that dalteparin prophylaxis is safe in ICU patients with severe renal insufficiency, this will improve patient care in 2 ways: - dalteparin may reduce the risk of DVT (although this should be tested in future trials); and - dalteparin would reduce heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an infrequent but serious complication of UFH.

 Dalteparin's Influence on Renally Compromised: Anti-Ten-A Study (DIRECT)@highlight

The investigators' primary research objective is: - To determine the safety of dalteparin prophylaxis, 5,000 IU once-daily, in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients based on: - the proportion of patients with trough anti-Xa > 0.

40 IU/mL during dalteparin prophylaxis after 3 + 1 days, 10 + 1 days, and 17 + 1 days of dalteparin prophylaxis; - the risk of major bleeding during the treatment period.

 The investigators' secondary research objectives are: - To determine the pharmacokinetic properties of dalteparin prophylaxis in ICU patients with severe renal insufficiency; - To identify clinical and laboratory factors that predict an excessive anticoagulant effect (anti-Xa > 0.

10 IU/mL); - To estimate the relationship between trough anti-Xa levels and bleeding.

 The DIRECT Pilot Study: Before embarking on a large trial of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus standard unfractionated heparin (UFH), the DIRECT Study is needed to observe whether bioaccumulation of LMWH occurs in ICU patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, and to address potential problems with protocol implementation.
