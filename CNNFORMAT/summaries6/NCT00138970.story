(thirdQuint)Calcineurin Inhibitor-Free Immunosuppression in Renal Transplant Recipients at Low Immunogenic Risk.

 Primary Objective To compare renal function (51Cr-EDTA clearance) 12 months posttransplant, in primary renal allograft recipients (from cadaveric donor) at low immunogenic risk, 0 DR mis-match, receiving immunosuppressive therapy with A) Zenapax(R) (5 doses), CellCept(R) (1.

5 g bid.

, aiming for TDM for total trough concentrations of 2-6 mg/L) and prednisolone or B) Sandimmun Neoral(R) (full dose), CellCept(R) (1.

0 g bid.

) and prednisolone.

 Secondary Objectives To compare the two treatment groups with regard to: patient and graft survival (12 months), biopsy-proven and presumptive rejection episodes (3 and 12 months), posttransplant (12 months) incidence and severity of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, incidence of infection and tolerability and "success rate" of TDM guided CellCept(R) dosing in a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive protocol over 12 months.
