(secondQuint)Silver-Coated Endotracheal Tube to Reduce Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP).

 Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections.

Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) develops in a significant percentage of patients who have been ventilated for at least 48 hours, and is associated with high morbidity, mortality,and financial costs.

 Silver is a well-characterized antimicrobial agent, and is the active agent in multiple medical products used to reduce or control infection.

 Bard has developed a proprietary antimicrobial ETT, manufactured with a hydrophilic coating containing a fine dispersion of silver salts.

 This study compare the incidence and time to onset of VAP in patients intubated for >=24 hours with a proprietary silver-coated ETT versus those intubated for >= 24 hours with a standard non-coated ETT.

 Silver-Coated Endotracheal Tube to Reduce Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a silver-coated endotracheal tube (ETT) can reduce the incidence and/or delay the time of onset of VAP when compared to a non silver-coated ETT in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for >= 24 hours.
