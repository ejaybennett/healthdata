(firstQuint)INTRINSIC RV - Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing With AV Search Hysteresis in ICDs.

 The purpose of study is to assess whether AVSH will provide benefits of a dual-chamber ICD without the deleterious effects of unnecessary RV pacing.

 This study will aim to demonstrate that DDDR-AVSH is equal to VVI with respect to mortality and HF hospitalizations.
