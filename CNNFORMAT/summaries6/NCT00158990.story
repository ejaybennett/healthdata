(secondQuint)Triiodothyronine (T3) Supplementation in the Treatment of Bipolar and Unipolar Depression.

.

 AIM: To determine the therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects of triiodothyronine (T3) as a supplement to the treatment of bipolar depression (BPD) with a mood stabilizer (MS) (lithium - Li, valproic acid - VPA or carbamazepine - CBZ) and the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), sertraline; and as a supplement to the treatment of unipolar depression (UPD) with sertraline.

 METHOD: A random assignment, double blind, placebo-controlled trial separately evaluating patients with a) BPD who are treated with MS + sertraline + T3 or MS + sertraline + placebo and b) UPD who are treated with sertraline + T3 or sertraline + placebo, for up to 8 weeks in both cases.

 The design of the trial will permit both the outcome of treatment and the speed of response to be evaluated.

 Triiodothyronine (T3) Supplementation in the Treatment of Bipolar and Unipolar Depression.

@highlight

The purpose of this project is to determine whether concurrent treatment of patients with major depression (unipolar or bipolar) with triiodothyronine (T3) and sertraline, will lead to a stronger and/or more rapid antidepressant effect than treatment with sertraline alone.
