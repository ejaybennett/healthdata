(secondQuint)Evaluation of Metabolic Activity of Liver Metastases by FDG-PET Scanning.

 The goal of this study is to evaluate the activity of liver metastases before and after resection of the primary tumor.

 Non-invasive assessment of tumor metabolism is possible in vivo by means of positron emission tomography (PET)-scanning.

 Therefore, FDG-PET scan offers a suitable approach to determine the influence of removal of a primary colorectal tumor on metabolic activity of the liver metastases.

 The FDG uptake in the liver metastases is quantified by calculating standardised uptake values (SUVs).

 Evaluation of Metabolic Activity of Liver Metastases by FDG-PET Scanning@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of primary tumor resection on the metabolic activity of metastases in patients with a colorectal primary tumor and synchronous liver metastases by positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro[18F]-D-glucose (FDG-PET) scanning.
