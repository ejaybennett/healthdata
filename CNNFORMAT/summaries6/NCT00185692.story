(secondQuint)Allogeneic Transplantation From Related Haploidentical Donors.

 An alternative to conventional allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is by using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.

 This regime would consist of both; total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).

 Used in combination to achieve engraftment of haploidentical CD34+ selected peripheral blood stem cells in older patients or patients with underlying medical conditions that preclude standard allogeneic treatment.

 The expected results of this transplant regime will be expected to result in hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution, decreased deaths related to the treatment regimen and decreased gravft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

 Allogeneic Transplantation From Related Haploidentical Donors@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of transplanting CD34+ selected hematopoietic cells from a haploidentical related donor following a nonmyeloablative regimen of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG).
