(thirdQuint)The CRT-KIR Study (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy [CRT] in the Early Phase After Heart Surgery).

 Patients with bundle branch block have a delayed electrical activation of the left ventricle causing abnormal contractility of the left ventricle.

 We hypothesize that patients may benefit from short term (= 72 hours) CRT (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) in the early phase after open heart surgery.

 Patients: reduced LV function and bundle branch block.

 Study type: randomisation to CRT versus standard postoperative treatment Study variables: cardiac output, echocardiographic measures, p-BNP and hours with inotropic therapy.

 The CRT-KIR Study (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy [CRT] in the Early Phase After Heart Surgery)@highlight

In patients with broad QRS complexes on electrocardiogram (ECG), the delayed electrical activation of the left heart chamber will cause abnormal contraction.

This has been shown to be possible to treat by a special pacemaker treatment which includes pacing of the left heart chamber (= CRT treatment).

 In this study the researchers will investigate the effect of acute CRT treatment in the early phase after open heart surgery.
