(secondQuint)The Study to Treat Superficial Femoral Artery Occlusions.

.

 This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating the performance of the Cordis SMART cent nitinol self-expanding stent as compared to angioplasty only.

 It is anticipated that a total of 150 patients will be entered into the study.

 Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis of stent versus angioplasty only.

 150 patients with de novo or restenotic native SFA occlusions (5-22 cm) with reference vessel of >= 4.

0 to cent nitinol self-expanding stent or to angioplasty only.

 All patients will be followed for 12 months post-procedure, by telephone contact at 3 and 6 months, and a 12 month clinical and duplex ultrasound assessment.

 This study will be conducted at up to 12 investigational sites.
