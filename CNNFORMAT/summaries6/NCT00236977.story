(firstQuint)Comparison of Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Iron Versus Oral Iron in Chronic Renal Failure Subjects With Anemia.

 The intent of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of two forms of iron therapy for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis dependent, chronic renal failure patients receiving or not receiving erythropoietin.

 After an extensive enrollment period, patients were randomized to receive oral iron (ferrous sulfate, 325mg three times daily (TID) for 56 days) or IV iron sucrose (total 1000mg, 500mg X 2 OR 200mg X 5 within two weeks).

 Erythropoietin schedule was to remain unchanged during the 56 day study.
