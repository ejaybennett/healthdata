(fifthQuint)Taxoprexin Plus Carboplatin Treatment for Advanced Lung Cancer.

 This is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin(R) in combination with every three (3) week carboplatin compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin every three (3) weeks, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease.

 Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents.

 Patients will be randomized to receive Taxoprexin(R) at a dose of 400 mg/m2 intravenously by one (1)-hour weekly infusion, 5/6 weeks followed immediately by carboplatin AUC = 4 on weeks one (1) and four (4) as a 30 minute intravenous infusion or paclitaxel 225mg/m2 as a three (3) hour intravenous infusion followed immediately by carboplatin AUC = 6 as a 30 minute intravenous infusion, every three (3) weeks.

 Patients will receive Taxoprexin(R) and carboplatin infusions or paclitaxel and carboplatin infusions until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, completion of six (6) treatment cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin or three (3) treatment cycles of Taxoprexin(R) plus carboplatin, refusal of continued treatment by the patient, or Investigator decision.

 Taxoprexin Plus Carboplatin Treatment for Advanced Lung Cancer@highlight

The primary objective of this trial is to compare the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with weekly Taxoprexin in combination with carboplatin to those treated with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in a prospectively randomized trial.

 In addition, the response rate to each regimen, response duration, time to progression and time to treatment failure will be measured.

 Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two groups.
