(firstQuint)Immune Ablation and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Support in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Phase II Study.

 Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem, inflammatory disorder characterized by the production of antibodies that react with many different self-antigens.

 Defects in immune regulation underlie the breakdown in self-tolerance.

(1) The clinical course of lupus is variable.

 Aggressive intervention is reserved for disease with characteristic high risk features including diffuse, proliferative glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, cerebritis and other life-threatening manifestations of vasculitis.

 In patients with SLE and high risk features, we propose extension of current immunosuppressive therapy to the point of complete immune ablation and hematopoietic stem cell recovery.
