(thirdQuint)Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging in Evaluating Patients Who Are Undergoing Treatment for Gliomas.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) characteristics of patients who are undergoing treatment for supratentorial glioma.

 - Determine the survival of patients who undergo magnetic resonance imaging and MRSI.

 - Determine the clinical outcome of patients who undergo these imaging procedures.

 - Correlate measures of metabolic tumor burden (i.

e.

, CNI, CCCrI, CrNI, and LLI) with survival and clinical outcome in patients who undergo these imaging procedures.

 - Determine the time to clinical progression in patients who undergo these imaging procedures.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on grade of disease.

 - Group 1 (patients with grade II glioma): Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).

 Patients then receive chemotherapy.

 Patients undergo repeat MRI/MRSI after courses 2 and 4 of chemotherapy.

 - Group 2 (patients with grade III-IV glioma): Patients undergo MRI/MRSI and then undergo surgical resection of the tumor.

 Patients then receive chemoradiotherapy.

 Patients undergo repeat MRI/MRSI within 2 weeks and at 2 months after completion of radiotherapy.

 Patients are followed for recurrence, disease progression, and survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), (done before, during, and after treatment) may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MRI and MRSI evaluate patients who are undergoing treatment for gliomas.
