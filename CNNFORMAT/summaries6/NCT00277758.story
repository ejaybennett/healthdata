(secondQuint)Safety Study of Low Dose Interleukin 2 (IL-2) Plus PEG-IFN/RBV In Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype I.

 This is a single center study of 12 weeks of IL-2 lead in immunotherapy followed by 48 weeks of IL2 immunotherapy in combination with Pegylated Interferon Alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) /Ribavirin (RBV) antiviral therapy for the treatment of individuals infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype I.

 The study is designed to determine whether immunotherapy immunotherapy with low dose daily IL-2 can be safely added to the standard antiviral therapy of 48 weeks of PEG-IFN and RBV.

 Because IL-2 targets recently antigen- activated T cells, IL-2 therapy will be initiated 12 weeks before PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, when HCV antigen load is high, to activate and expand HCV antigen-specific T cells prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy.

This is a treatment study trial, in which we will assess the safety and tolerability of daily dose IL-2, as monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by IL2 in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV for 48 weeks in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C.
