(secondQuint)Effectiveness of Auto-adjusted Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Long-term Treatment of Sleep Apnea.

 1.

 To investigate whether computer controlled continuous positive airway pressure (autoCPAP) improves subjective sleepiness, quality of life, objective vigilance, and nocturnal respiration to a similar degree as conventional fixed continuous positive airway pressure in the initial phase of treatment and over the subsequent 2 years during home therapy 2.

 To investigate the cost of autoCPAP compared to fixed CPAP therapy.

 Effectiveness of Auto-adjusted Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Long-term Treatment of Sleep Apnea@highlight

Hypothesis: Computer controlled continuous positive airway pressure (autoCPAP) is equally effective in improving obstructive sleep apnea syndrome symptoms, breathing disturbances, objective vigilance, and it is cost-effective compared to conventional fixed continuous positive airway pressure.
