(fifthQuint)Emotional Experiences in Fathers of NICU Infants.

 It is well known that birth and hospitalization of a preterm infant is stressful for parents.

 Numerous studies have evaluated emotional factors such as maternal stress, parental role alteration, and maternal depression.

 Researchers have also investigated both maternal and paternal emotional responses in relation to their infant being hospitalized in the NICU.

 Studies examining paternal response alone have received less research attention.

 To date, no studies have compared the emotional response of fathers of medical NICU babies and fathers of surgical NICU babies.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare perceived paternal stress and depressive symptomatology in fathers of preterm medical and surgical infants.

 Fathers who agree to participate will be given a questionnaire that is comprised of two self-report tools.

 Together these tools should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

 Fathers who participate will be asked to complete these tools at three different times throughout their infants' stay in the NICU.

 Emotional Experiences in Fathers of NICU Infants@highlight

This study is designed to evaluate the emotional experiences of fathers who have preterm infants who are hospitalized in a (neonatal intensive care unit)NICU setting.

 In addition, we will compare the emotional responses experienced by father of surgical NICU babies and fathers of medical NICU babies.

 Our primary hypothesis is that paternal stress levels will be lower for those fathers of infants who are hospitalized in a medical NICU compared with fathers of infants who are hospitalized in a surgical NICU.

 Secondary hypotheses include: 1) Stress levels for fathers of hospitalized infants will decrease over time; 2) Depressive symptomatology modulates perceived stress in fathers of NICU infants.
