(secondQuint)Steroid Withdrawal in Pediatric Renal Transplant Recipients Under Cyclosporine (CyA) and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF).

 The present protocol aims to investigate the steroid-saving potential of MMF in pediatric patients after NTx.

 Over a 2-year period, two treatment regimes will be compared in randomized form in patients with a stable renal transplant function in the course of 12 - 24 months after transplantation (controlled first study phase): Branch A: CyA + MMF + withdrawal of steroids over a three-month period following randomization Branch B: CyA + MMF + 4 mg/m methylprednisolone (or prednisolone equivalent)/day After two years of observation, steroids in the control group (branch B) can be withdrawn optionally in conformity with the same protocol as in branch A (uncontrolled second study phase).

 It is to be expected that part of the patients will decide in favour of a withdrawal of steroids.

 In the uncontrolled second study phase, a comparison will thus be drawn among three therapy groups over a period of another 15 months (altogether 3.

5 years beginning with randomization), in order to throw some light on the medium-term effect of steroid-free immunosuppression on length growth and transplant function.

 Steroid Withdrawal in Pediatric Renal Transplant Recipients Under Cyclosporine (CyA) and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)@highlight

The present study investigates the safety and efficacy of steroid withdrawal in pediatric renal transplant recipients with stable graft function under concomitant immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.
