(secondQuint)Efficacy Study of Continuous Intraarticular Infusion in Patients Undergoing Arthroscopic Knee and Shoulder Operations.

 We propose to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the continuous intraarticular delivery of local anesthetics via a disposable, self-regulated DonJoy Pain Control infusion pump.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either an intra-articular infusion of bupivacaine 0.

125%, or saline delivered at a rate of 5 ml/hr for 48 hours by a DonJoy(R) Pain Control infusion pump.

 Patients will receive a femoral block (FNB) and a sciatic block (SNB) for knee arthroscopy or an interscalene block (INB) for shoulder arthroscopy prior to surgery.

 After the operation, patients will receive morphine via a Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump for pain control.

 The patient will be admitted overnight to a Care Unit, with the PCA discontinued at discharge or 24 hours, whichever is earlier.

 If clinically indicated, the PCA may be extended at the discretion of the pain team.

 Upon discharge and during the 48 hour study period the patient will receive oral oxycodone and acetaminophen.

 The patient and their family will remove the DonJoy(R) Pain Control infusion pump 48 hours after the surgery.

 Efficacy Study of Continuous Intraarticular Infusion in Patients Undergoing Arthroscopic Knee and Shoulder Operations@highlight

The aim of this study is to determine whether the continuous intraarticular infusion of local anesthetics in the postoperative period can improve analgesia and patients satisfaction after knee and shoulder arthroscopy.
