(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study With Catumaxomab in Patients After Curative Resection of a Gastric Adenocarcinoma.

 A controlled, randomized, open-label, multi-center, parallel-group, Phase II study to generate valid hypotheses on safety and efficacy issues in patients with a primary confirmed diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and a high risk of disseminated tumor cells due to serosal infiltration after curative gastrectomy.

 Eligible patients will be centrally randomized by IVRS during operation to one of the two study groups in an 1:1 ratio: surgery plus catumaxomab or surgery alone.

 Treatment with catumaxomab will consist of an initial dose of 10 mu g given intraoperatively as an intraperitoneal bolus on day 0 and of four following ascending doses (10-20-50-150 mu g) which will be administered as an i.
