(secondQuint)Clinical Efficacy and Tolerability of Two FSH Preparations (Human FSH Versus rFSH - Follitropin Alpha) in Women Undergoing IVF.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, investigator blinded, randomized, concurrent control, phase III clinical trial.

 Patients meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly assigned to receive either the test drug (Fostimon(R), IBSA) or the reference drug (Gonal-F(R), Serono Inc.

).

 Investigators will be blinded by not allowing them to have any contact with the study medications (supplied in boxes labeled in a manner that does not reveal the content of the boxes), and requesting that patients do not make any statements to the investigator that might indicate the treatment to which they were assigned.

 Equivalence testing with regard to the primary outcome variable will establish whether the two treatments are indeed similarly effective.
