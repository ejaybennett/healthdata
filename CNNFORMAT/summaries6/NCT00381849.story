(fifthQuint)Use of an Herbal Preparation to Prevent and Dissolve Kidney Stones.

 Cystone will be used in proven cystine and calcium stone forming adults who are not pregnant.

 Subjects must have a measurable stone by CT.

 The first phase is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled cross-over of Cystone and placebo for 6 weeks each separated by a 1 week washout.

 Entry, 6 and 12 week 24 hour urine supersaturations or cystine, pH and sodium determinations will be collected.

 Then all patients enter an open label phase of 46 weeks, ensuring a 52-week total exposure to Cystone during the 59 week study.

 Baseline and 1 year stone quantification CT scans will be performed.

 End points will be changes in urine chemistry/supersaturation and stone burden.

 Stone burden was measured by CT, quantitatively for stone density and volume.

 All CT images were also reviewed in a blinded fashion by a radiologist to score each kidney as increased, no change or decreased stone burden.

 Statistics and Randomization: Randomization was accomplished using a table provided by the department of statistics to the study coordinator who was blinded as to whether the patients received placebo or Cystone(R).

 Biochemical and supersaturation results were analyzed via a matched pair analysis using the JMP software package (SAS Instituted, Inc.

); P values < 0.

05 were deemed significant.

 Use of an Herbal Preparation to Prevent and Dissolve Kidney Stones@highlight

We will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a mixture of 9 east Indian herbs known as Cystone regarding their ability to dissolve existing kidney stones and prevent formation of new ones.

 Cystine and calcium stone formers will be recruited for a 59 week trial.

 The first phase of the study will be two 6 weeks periods during which each subject will receive Cystone or placebo in random order (with a one-week wash out between 6 week treatment periods).

 The remaining 46 weeks, each subject will receive Cystone.

 End points are changes in urinary chemistries and stone burden by Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning.
