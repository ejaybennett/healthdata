(firstQuint)Multiple Dose Trial Comparing the Plasma Levels of Two Different Analgesic Transdermal Patch Formulations.

 Main: To demonstrate the bioequivalence of the new buprenorphine transdermal patch T2rev formulation containing 13 mg buprenorphine (Test) as compared to Transtec(R) PRO 70 mu g/h patch transdermal patch containing 40 mg buprenorphine as reference after multiple patch application.

 Pharmacokinetic target parameters are AUCss,Tau and Css,max.

 Further: To assess the safety, tolerability, skin tolerability and adhesiveness of the patch applications.

 To evaluate the following further Pharmacokinetic parameters: Css,min, Css,ave, PTF, Swing, tss,max, and t1/2,z.

 Multiple Dose Trial Comparing the Plasma Levels of Two Different Analgesic Transdermal Patch Formulations@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Transtec(R) PRO 70 mu g/h and a new buprenorphine patch formulation lead to same plasma levels of buprenorphine after multiple dose application.
