(thirdQuint)Intracoronary Stem Cells in Large Myocardial Infarction.

 In the current era, up to 30% of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, usually those presenting late, show ongoing left ventricular (LV) remodeling and poor clinical outcome despite primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

 Cardiac transfer of bone marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells has been investigated as an adjunctive therapy to promote regeneration of infarcted myocardium.

 Therefore, we designed a multicenter, randomized study to test the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs in patients with large acute anterior myocardial infarction and late presentation, who were treated with successful primary PCI.

Despite the widespread use of effective reperfusion therapies, the patients presenting late with large myocardial infarction have poor outcomes.

 The aim of the study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMNCs) in patients with large myocardial infarction
