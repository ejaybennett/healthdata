(fifthQuint)AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Given to NHL and MM Patients to Increase the Number of PBSCs When Given a Mobilizing Regimen of G-CSF.

 Participants with NHL and MM who have undergone prior cyto-reductive chemotherapy, are to be autologously transplanted, and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to enter the study.

 The only change to the standard of care is the addition of plerixafor to a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization regimen on the day prior to apheresis.

 Participants will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 mcg/kg each day) and will receive plerixafor (240 mcg/kg) in the evening prior to apheresis.

 Participants will undergo apheresis for up to 5 consecutive days in order to collect the target number of CD34+ stem cells ( 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for either single or tandem transplant).

 After apheresis, all participants will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation.

 Participants will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization regimen.

 The increase in CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood from the time of the plerixafor dose to just prior to apheresis and the number of CD34+ cells in the apheresis product will be measured.

 Success of the transplantation(s) will be evaluated by the time to engraftment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN).

 A subpopulation will have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis done.

 AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Given to NHL and MM Patients to Increase the Number of PBSCs When Given a Mobilizing Regimen of G-CSF@highlight

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of plerixafor given in addition to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM).

 Efficacy outcomes include evaluation of fold increase in circulating CD34+ cells from just before the first plerixafor injection to 10-11 hours post plerixafor (just before apheresis) and assessment of successful polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) engraftment after transplantation.

 Data from this protocol will assist in the determination of the dosing schedule for future studies.
