 All patients initially treated with systemic corticosteroids alone: optional IV methylprednisolone pulse (15 mg/kg) at treatment start followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) according to a tapering schedule.

 Treating physicians allowed to treat minor relapses with corticosteroids without referring the patient for randomization, as long as the prednisone dose did not exceed 0.

5 mg/kg for 1 month.

 Patients in whom prednisone doses could not be tapered below 20 mg, those who failed to enter remission and those who relapsed were randomized to receive either 6 months of oral azathioprine (2mg/kg/day) or 6 cyclophosphamide pulses (0.

6g/m2 D1, D15, D30 then every month).
