(secondQuint)Lithium Carbonate in Treating Patients With Acute Intestinal Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD) After Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the effects of lithium on functional and mucosal anatomic recovery in the small or large bowel of patients with acute GVHD.

 II.

 Functional recovery will be evaluated according to changes in clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal GVHD.

 III.

 Mucosal anatomic recovery will be evaluated by review of results from clinically indicated endoscopic evaluations.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the tolerability of lithium administration in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lithium carbonate once or twice daily.

 Treatment continues for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
