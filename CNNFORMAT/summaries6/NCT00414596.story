(firstQuint)Pilot Study to Evaluate The Effectiveness And Safety Of Axiom Worldwide Drx9000 Spinal Decompression System.

 Currently, there are no prospective safety and/or outcomes studies utilizing the DRX9000 cent in the peer-reviewed medical literature.

 There are published trials utilizing similar machines which provided evidence in support of the FDA granted indications for use spinal decompression and of the DRX9000 cent .

 Axiom Worldwide has determined it will be of benefit to the continuing medical care of patients and a furthering of the scientific knowledge of the treatment of LBP to complete such a prospective evaluation using a standardized treatment protocol.

 This study will therefore attempt to establish and validate the safety and efficacy of this computerized spinal decompression system in the treatment of LBP and sciatica.
