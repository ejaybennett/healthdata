(fifthQuint)Gefitinib and PEG-Interferon Alfa-2a in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Skin Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the tolerability of gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a in patients with unresectable or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

 - Determine the response rate in patients treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

 - Determine whether the addition of weekly PEG-interferon alfa-2a to ongoing gefitinib improves response rate in these patients .

 - Determine whether PEG-interferon alfa-2a exacerbates rash in patients who have been treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

 OUTLINE: This is a phase I, pilot, dose de-escalation study of PEG-interferon alfa-2a followed by an open-label, phase II study.

 - Phase I: Patients receive oral gefitinib alone once daily for 4 weeks.

 Beginning in week 5, patients also receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously once weekly.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of patients receive de-escalating doses of PEG-interferon alfa-2a until a tolerable dose is determined.

 - Phase II: Patients receive gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a at the tolerable dose determined in phase I.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Gefitinib and PEG-Interferon Alfa-2a in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Skin Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 PEG-interferon alfa-2a may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of skin cancer.

 Giving gefitinib together with PEG-interferon alfa-2a may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PEG-interferon alfa-2a when given together with gefitinib and to see how well they work in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic skin cancer.
