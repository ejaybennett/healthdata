(firstQuint)Ceftriaxone Vs Levofloxacin on Cytokine Expression in Pneumococcal Pneumonia.

 Bacterial alveolar invasion is followed by a compartmentalized inflammatory response.

 Data suggest that some antimicrobials may induce a differential release of cytokines, with the potential of either accelerating or down regulating cytokine production.

 The aim of our study was to compare the effects of ceftriaxone compared with levofloxacin on cytokine systemic concentrations in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.
