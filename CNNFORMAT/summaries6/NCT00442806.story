(secondQuint)Randomized Clinical Trial of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells in the Treatment of Pts With ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction.

 Subjects who have coronary artery disease and have suffered a ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction will be evaluated for eligibility in this study.

 Eligible subjects will undergo standard treatment after admission to the hospital and will then undergo liposuction under local anesthesia, after which ADRC's will be isolated from the lipoaspirate.

 According to randomization subjects will receive either ADRC's or placebo.
