(fifthQuint)The Effect of Rituximab on Mobilization With AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Plus G-CSF in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin Disease (HD).

 This is a single-center, 2-arm, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety of plerixafor when used in combination with rituximab (Rituxan(R)) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

 Participants will be assigned to one of 2 arms based on the immunophenotype of their lymphoma.

 (A)Participants with CD20(-) lymphoma will undergo mobilization with G-CSF and plerixafor.

 (B) Participants with CD20(+) lymphomas will undergo mobilization with rituximab, G-CSF, and plerixafor.

 They will receive a weekly dose of 375 mg/m2 rituximab by intravenous (iv) infusion beginning 1 week prior to, and continuing until 2 weeks after, the first dose of G-CSF.

 Participants in both groups will receive 7.

5 mu g/kg G-CSF twice daily (morning and evening) for 4 days.

 In the evening (approximately 10:00 pm) on Day 4, a dose of plerixafor (240 mu g/kg) will be administered.

 Apheresis will be initiated the next morning, approximately 10 to 11 hours after plerixafor is given.

 Participants will continue to receive G-CSF twice daily and to receive the evening dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis the next morning for up to a total of 4 aphereses or until 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.

 Participants with an adequate number of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) collected by apheresis will be admitted to the study center for the administration of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation.

 After transplantation, the times to PMN, PLT, and lymphocyte engraftment will be measured.

 Participants will remain hospitalized until they achieve an absolute granulocyte count of >500/ mu l in the peripheral blood.

 Graft durability will be assessed at 100 days, and 6 and 12 months post-transplantation.

 Participants will continue to receive G-CSF twice daily and to receive the evening dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis the next morning for up to a total of 4 aphereses or until 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.

 Participants who are transplanted will be monitored for the time to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), platelets (PLT), and lymphocyte engraftment.

 Follow-up assessments will be done at 100 days, and 6 and 12 months post-transplantation.
