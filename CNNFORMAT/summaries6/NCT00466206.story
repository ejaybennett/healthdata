(fifthQuint)Magnetic Mini-Mover Procedure to Treat Pectus Excavatum.

 Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall abnormality in children.

 Surgical correction requires a big operation under general anesthesia which forces the sternum forward and holds it in place using a metal chest wall strut.

 Deformation of the chest wall under great pressure may result in complications and potential relapses as well as postoperative pain requiring hospitalization for regional and narcotic anesthesia for up to a week.

 An alternative principle for correction of chest wall and other deformities is gradual (bit-by-bit) correction using minimal force applied over many months (like moving teeth with orthodontic braces).

 The hypothesis of this study is that constant outward force on the deformed cartilage in pectus excavatum will produce biologic reformation of cartilage and correction of the chest wall deformity.

 The study investigators have developed a novel method of achieving gradual deformation/reformation of chest wall cartilage without the need for transdermal orthopedic devices or repeated surgeries.

 A magnetic force field is used to apply controlled, sustained force to promote biologic reformation of structural cartilage (the same principle as distraction osteogenesis).

 A magnet is implanted on the sternum and secured using a novel fixation strategy that can be accomplished through a 3-cm subxyphoid incision as a brief outpatient procedure.

 The magnet (and sternum) is pulled outward by another magnet suspended in a novel, low-profile, lightweight device previously molded to the patient's anterior chest wall.

 The external magnet allows individual adjustment in small increments of the distance (and, thus, force) and orientation of the force applied to the sternum.

 The low-profile, non-obtrusive anterior chest wall prosthesis is held in place by the force field between the two magnets.

 The study objectives are to test the safety and probable benefit of this procedure in 10 otherwise healthy, young patients, between 8 years and 14 years of age, who have chosen to have this deformity corrected using this novel technique rather than the standard Ravitch or Nuss techniques.

 We will document the rate of correction by chest imaging and measurement of the Pectus Severity Index.

 The study investigators will document safety and efficacy with an EKG prior to implantation, one month post-implantation, and finally after the magnet is removed, as well as patient and family satisfaction with a post-procedure Quality of Life-type survey.

 Magnetic Mini-Mover Procedure to Treat Pectus Excavatum@highlight

This is a medical research study.

 The study investigators have developed a method to gradually repair pectus excavatum (sunken chest) deformity by placing a magnet on the sternum (breastbone) and then applying an external magnetic force that will pull the sternum outward gradually.

 Potential candidates for this study are children and adolescents with a previously diagnosed congenital pectus excavatum (sunken chest) deformity who are otherwise healthy and are seeking corrective surgery for their condition.

 They will be residents of the U.

S.

 and between the ages of 8 and 14 years of age.

 Potential candidates and their families will have already been counseled about this condition and about the standard way to repair this deformity.

 The purpose of this study is to test what effects, good and/or bad, placing an external/internal magnetic device has on correcting pectus excavatum deformity in children, and the safety of using such a device for treatment.
