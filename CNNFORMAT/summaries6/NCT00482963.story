(firstQuint)A Study of the Drug Interactions Between a Hormonal Emergency Contraception and an HIV Medication.

 The use of hormonal contraceptive pills in women with HIV is complex due to potential interactions between these agents and HIV medications.

 HIV-infected women taking efavirenz have an even greater need for effective birth control as this medication may cause severe brain damage to a developing fetus.

 The use of an emergency contraceptive agent in cases of unprotected sex or condom failure can prevent pregnancy.

 This study seeks to establish that Plan B can be used effectively and safely in women taking efavirenz.
