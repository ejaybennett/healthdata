(fifthQuint)Microdissection Testicular Sperm Extraction (MicroTESE) and IVF-ICSI Outcome in Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA).

 Men diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia and seeking assisted reproductive technology treatment (ART) are candidates for surgical sperm retrieval with the aid of microdissection.

 We believe that this approach may currently be the best option for these subjects.

 We evaluated our surgical sperm retrieval rate associated to their serum LH, FSH, TOTAL TESTOTERONE and PROLACTIN levels, pre-operative testicular volume and also compared to the post-operative histological analysis of fixed testicular tissue specimens collected during the procedure, stained with haematoxylin and eosin.

 We also evaluated the outcomes using ICSI based ART for these couples observing mean ICSI and fertilized oocytes, number and quality of embryos transferred, implantation and pregnancy rates.

 Microdissection Testicular Sperm Extraction (MicroTESE) and IVF-ICSI Outcome in Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA)@highlight

We evaluated the application of surgical testicular exploration with the aid of a microscope (MictoTESE) to increase the chances of obtaining sperm in men with impaired sperm production, a condition known as non-obstructive azoospermia.

 We also evaluated the outcomes of these couples when the sperm obtained were used in ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) during assisted reproductive technology treatment.

 We believe that excellent results may be obtained with the use of the following techniques in the treatment of couples where non-obstructive azoospermia is a significant cause.
