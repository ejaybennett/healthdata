(secondQuint)Growth Response in Short Children Suffering From a Disease With Growth Retardation and Treated With Somatropin.

 Growth hormone (GH, Somatropin, e.

g.

 Genotropin(R)) is approved in the treatment of children in specific indications.

 However, besides the benefit in approved indications, a benefit can also be achieved in other pathological conditions that lead to growth retardation.

 However, because of their relative low frequency and the long duration of GH studies in children, few data or only case reports on GH treatment are available in these conditions.

 Nevertheless, published data have suggested a benefit of GH treatment in children suffering from some of those diseases and pediatric endocrinologists sometimes request GH treatment for those children to improve growth rate.

 This protocol is designed to allow such children with severe growth retardation to be treated with GH and will allow those children to be carefully followed-up and finally evaluated at the end of the GH treatment period.
