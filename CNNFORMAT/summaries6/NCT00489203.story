(thirdQuint)Beclomethasone Dipropionate in Preventing Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the efficacy of oral BDP for prevention of acute GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimens.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily beginning at the start of the conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant.

 Patients also receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate post-transplant.

 ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily beginning at the start of the conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant.

 Patients also receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate post-transplant.

 In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
