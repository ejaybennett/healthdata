(thirdQuint)Zileuton to Treat Adults With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (The LEUKO Study).

 COPD is a disease in which the lung airways are partly damaged and obstructed, making it difficult to breathe.

 COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.

 Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.

 Treatment usually includes inhaled bronchodilator or steroid medications that work by relaxing the muscles around the lung airways and reducing inflammation.

 Zileuton, a medication that is used to prevent asthma symptoms, may be beneficial in treating people who experience COPD exacerbations.

 Zileuton works by blocking the formation of substances that cause inflammation, fluid retention, and constriction in the lungs.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of zileuton at reducing the length of a hospital stay for adults who are hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation.

 This study will enroll adults who are admitted to the hospital due to severe COPD symptoms.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either zileuton or placebo four times a day for up to 14 days.

 While in the hospital, lung function testing and urine collection will occur.

 Study visits will occur at Days 14 and 30, and will include lung function testing, a medical history review, and a study drug adverse effects review.
