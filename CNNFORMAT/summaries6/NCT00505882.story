(secondQuint)Efficacy of Pramlintide on Prevention of Weight Gain Early Onset of Type 1 Diabetes.

 The autoimmune process along with a strong genetic-mediated destruction and dysfunction of pancreatic -cells are the main pathogeneses of type 1 diabetes.

 These processes cause absolute and relative insulin and amylin deficiencies.

 For the last decades, insulin therapy has been the primary therapy for type 1 diabetes.

 Amylin is a 37 amino acid peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin mostly by the pancreatic cells in response to meals.

 Amylin has several known effects including suppression of postprandial glucagon secretion, regulation of gastric emptying, and reduction of food intake.

 Pramlintide is an amylin analog recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be given at meal time as an adjunct to insulin therapy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have failed to achieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy or insulin therapy with or without a sulfonylurea agent and/or metformin.

 Several clinical trials showed that meal time amylin replacement with pramlintide along with insulin therapy improved post-prandial hyperglucagonemia, and reduced post-prandial glucose excursion.

 A recent randomized control trial showed that pramlintaide reduced weight by up to 2kg in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

 The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive diabetes therapy delays the onset and progression of microvascular disease such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.

 The DCCT also showed that the prevalence of obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) 27.

8 kg/m2 for men and 27.

3 kg/m2 for women, was 33.

1% in the intensive treatment group compared with 19.

1% in the conventional treatment group.

 Intensively treated patients gained an average of 4.

75 kg more than conventionally treated patients (P cell function, even modest levels of activity can be advantage in preventing hypoglycemic episodes and also reducing the incidence of retinopathy and nephropathy.

 No study to date has been designed to analyze the effect of pramlintide treatment on the preservation of cell function in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects.

 This pilot study will evaluate the effect of pramlintide on the prevention of weight gain and its effects on beta cell function among early onset type 1 diabetes patients.

 Early onset is defined as those who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes six to twelve months prior to entry in this study.

 Efficacy of Pramlintide on Prevention of Weight Gain Early Onset of Type 1 Diabetes@highlight

In this pilot study we are evaluating the efficacy of pramlintide on preventing weight gain among early onset type 1 diabetes.

 We are also evaluating the safety and the effects of treatment with pramlintide on early diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects, especially among pediatric subjects.
