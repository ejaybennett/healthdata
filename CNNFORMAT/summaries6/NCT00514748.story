(thirdQuint)A Bilateral Interconnected DIEP Flap Based on One Vessel Pedicle for Breast Reconstruction.

 The DIEP flap have become the most common and primary choice in autogenous tissue breast reconstruction nowadays.

 In cases with inadequate abdominal soft-tissue volume or abdominal midline scar, the bilateral DIEP flap is needed.

However, it need two groups of recipient vessels.

 So it is unavailable in cases short of two groups of recipient vessels after radiotherapy.

 This study is aimed to solve the problems by interconnecting one of the branches of DIEA each side.

 The MDCT will be used to predict the branches and perforators of DIEA both sides.

 According to the branches of DIEAs, one branch will be anastomosed with that on contralateral side with only one vessel pedicle preserved on one side.

 We believe that the whole flap can be completely nourished with only one vessel pedicle by means of vessel interconnection.

 A Bilateral Interconnected DIEP Flap Based on One Vessel Pedicle for Breast Reconstruction@highlight

Bilateral DIEP flap needs two groups of vessel pedicles.

 We suppose that the bilateral DIEP flap may survive on one vessel pedicle by means of interconnection of bilateral DIEA.

 This study is aimed to build a interconnected vessel system of bilateral DIEP flap based on one vessel pedicle and observe its survival in breast reconstruction.
