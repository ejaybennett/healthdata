(fifthQuint)Effects Of Exenatide On Liver Biochemistry, Liver Histology And Lipid Metabolism In Patients With Fatty Liver Disease.

 Preliminary evidence suggests that exenatide (Byetta(R)) may have several beneficial direct and indirect effects on NAFLD and liver lipid metabolism.

 Ad hoc analysis of phase III studies has shown that exenatide treatment is associated with improvement and normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver injury, and that this effect is most pronounced in those with the greatest weight loss.

 In addition, treatment of leptin deficient ob/ob mice with exenatide reduced weight, liver lipid content, serum ALT and liver lipid peroxidation.

 Additional evidence suggests that the effects of exenatide on the liver are not simply a result of weight loss, but rather due to direct effects on the liver.

 Hepatocytes express GLP-1 receptors that are responsive to both GLP-1 and exenatide.

 Furthermore, exenatide treatment of ob/ob mice or isolated hepatocytes reduces mRNA for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) and SREBP-1c, which would be expected to reduce DNL.

 Based upon this data, we hypothesize that exenatide treatment of diabetic patients with NAFLD and NASH will reduce liver injury through multiple mechanisms including weight reduction associated with exenatide, improved lipid metabolism by decreased expression of hepatic genes involved in DNL and reduction of adipokines and cytokines associated with severe NASH.

 This study is aimed to address the potential safety and efficacy of exenatide in the treatment of NAFLD and test these hypotheses.

 This will be an open label, single-arm, non-comparative trial of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD treated with exenatide for 6 months with the following specific aims to be assessed: Determine the safety and efficacy of 24 weeks of exenatide treatment in diabetic patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Efficacy will be measured by changes in serum ALT (primary endpoint) and liver histology.

 Characterize the effects of exenatide on serum levels of adipokines and inflammatory cytokines including adiponectin, leptin and TNF- in NAFLD patients.

 Compare the hepatic expression of SCD1, SREBP-1c and PPAR- mRNA in NAFLD patients pre- and post-treatment with exenatide.

 Establish the effects of exenatide on post-prandial lipid metabolism.

 Determine the effects of exenatide on liver fibrosis in NAFLD.

 Effects Of Exenatide On Liver Biochemistry, Liver Histology And Lipid Metabolism In Patients With Fatty Liver Disease@highlight

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common complications of type 2 diabetes and leading causes of liver disease in the US and Europe.

 The prevalence of NAFLD and NASH are expected to become a major cause of liver disease related deaths and liver transplantation.

 Currently, there are no specific therapies that alter the natural history of NAFLD.

Preliminary evidence suggests that exenatide (Byetta(R)) may have several beneficial direct and indirect effects on NAFLD and liver lipid metabolism.
