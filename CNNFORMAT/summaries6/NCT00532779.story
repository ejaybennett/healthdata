(firstQuint)A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Two Doses of Naltrexone SR/Bupropion SR and Placebo in Overweight and Obese Subjects.

 Two Phase II clinical trials demonstrated that a combination of bupropion SR and naltrexone is associated with greater weight loss than bupropion SR alone, naltrexone alone, or placebo in subjects with uncomplicated obesity.

 The current study investigated the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of the combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR compared to placebo in obese subjects with uncomplicated obesity and in those with overweight/obesity and hypertension and/or dyslipidemia.
