(secondQuint)Natural Killer Cells in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the evolution of functional receptors of natural killer (NK) cells after completion of chemotherapy in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission.

 Secondary - Measure the kinetics of cytotoxic functional recovery of NK cells.

 - Determine activation markers of NK cells.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive 1 course of consolidation therapy comprising an anthracycline and cytarabine to induce first remission.

 Blood is collected on day 0 of the consolidation course and then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks.

RATIONALE: Studying natural killer cells in samples of blood from patients with cancer may help doctors find out how these cells are effected by chemotherapy.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying natural killer cells in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
