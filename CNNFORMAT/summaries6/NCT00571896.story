(thirdQuint)The Use of SennaS for Prevention of Post-operative Constipation After Urogynecologic Surgery.

 Right now, doctors use mild laxatives and stool softeners to help you have a bowel movement earlier and with less pain after surgery.

 Sometimes if the stool softener or mild laxatives do not work, you may need to use stronger laxatives or enemas.

 We want to see if specifically using SennaS is better for having a bowel movement soon after surgery and with less pain.

 SennaS is FDA approved for constipation.

 It has a stool softener and a mild laxative and has been shown to be safe and effective for treating constipation.

We are doing this study to see if using an over the counter mild laxative, SennaS, there is a difference in time required to have a bowel movement in women who are having surgery for prolapse (when your uterus and/or vagina drop after childbirth or with age) and/or incontinence (when you leak urine or stool without your control) as compared to a sugar pill or placebo.
