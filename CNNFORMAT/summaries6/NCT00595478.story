(fifthQuint)Family Based Contingency Management for Adolescent Alcohol Abuse.

 Approximately 1.

5 million youth ages 12-17 (representing 6.

1% of all youth in that age range) are in need of treatment for alcohol abuse, yet only 7.

2% of those in need of treatment received it.

 Importantly, most youth (90.

5%) who were classified as needing treatment based on their self report of Adolescent Alcohol Study Plan; v.

2; 3/30/12Page 2 of 35 symptoms, perceived no need for treatment.

 Thus, there is a need to develop treatments that target populations of alcohol abusing youth who are not highly motivated to change their substance use.

 New outpatient family based and contingency management interventions for adolescent marijuana abuse have been developed, yet none of these interventions has specifically targeted adolescent alcohol use.

 It is important to target primary alcohol abuse and dependence in adolescence as approximately 20% of treatment-seeking youth report primary problems with alcohol.

 The primary aim of this proposal is to adapt our family-based contingency-management treatment to target adolescent alcohol abuse and dependence.

 This project will develop, manualize, and pilot a contingency management intervention that includes two components.

 First, an incentive program will enhance the adolescent's engagement in the treatment process and engender alcohol abstinence by providing positive reinforcement for documented abstinence via breathalyzers administered by parents regularly at home, self and parent report, and clinic based urine drug testing.

 Second, a parent management training program will enhance and maintain the positive effects of the incentive program by teaching parents how to effectively use contingency management in the home environment to motivate their adolescent to achieve abstinence and improve their behavior in other domains.

 Family Based Contingency Management for Adolescent Alcohol Abuse@highlight

The goal is to adapt the family-based CM treatment to target primary adolescent alcohol abuse and dependence.

 Specific Aim 1 is to provide a preliminary demonstration of the efficacy of a family-based CM intervention to treat adolescent alcohol abuse and dependence.

 CM components include: 1.

 an incentive program to enhance the adolescent's engagement in the treatment process and engender alcohol abstinence by providing positive reinforcement for documented abstinence via breathalyzers administered by parents regularly at home, self and parent report, and clinic-based urine drug testing; and 2.

 a parent management training program to enhance and maintain the positive effects of the incentive program by teaching parents how to effectively use contingency management in the home environment to motivate their adolescent to achieve abstinence and improve their behavior in other domains.

 A randomized trial will determine whether the CM intervention enhances outcomes when added to a standard individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

 Specific Aim 2 is to determine whether and how treatment interventions modify parental and adolescent risk and protective factors using observational and laboratory measures (parenting practices, family functioning, risk taking, delay discounting, and child and parent psychopathology) and to determine whether these factors are associated with outcomes over time.

 Specific Aim 3 is to test gene x environment (treatment) interactions in adolescent substance abuse.

 Findings will extend the scientific evidence for CM and support the ability of parents to implement CM at home.

 Findings that support the CM model's efficacy will make a significant contribution to research on the treatment of adolescent alcohol abuse, which has lagged behind research on adult substance abuse and on adolescent illicit drug use.
