(thirdQuint)Effects of Anti-IgE Antibody Omalizumab on Patients With Chronic Sinusitis.

 We propose to study the effects of Xolair on patients with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps.

 Since Xolair has been shown to be effective in asthmatic subjects with evidence of atopy and elevated IgE, we will limit our study to patients with chronic sinusitis and these parameters.

 The primary objective is to determine if Xolair decreases mucosal thickness on CT scan after 6 months of treatment.

 Effects of Anti-IgE Antibody Omalizumab on Patients With Chronic Sinusitis@highlight

We propose to study the effects of Xolair on patients with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps.

 Because of the similarities between the inflammatory processes found in asthmas and rhinitis to those found in chronic sinusitis, we hypothesize that sinusitis should respond to Xolair, just as asthma.
