(thirdQuint)Oral Baclofen Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Children With Spasticity.

 Although oral baclofen has been used for several decades for the treatment of spasticity in adults and in children, there is very little data regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of baclofen in children.

 Therefore, pediatric guidelines, including dose ranges, dosing schedules, dose escalation strategies and anticipated side effects are extrapolated from adult data and require an assumption that safety and efficacy in children is comparable to that in adults.

 Furthermore, there is wide variability in dosing strategies among practitioners who treat children with cerebral palsy (CP) with respect to starting doses, maximum doses and rates of dose escalation.

Establishment of safe and effective dosing strategies for children with CP requires an understanding of the PK and PD properties of baclofen in children and recognition of individual differences that may contribute to divergent clinical responses to baclofen among children with CP.

 Oral Baclofen Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Children With Spasticity@highlight

Oral baclofen is used commonly to treat spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.

 Although for adults there is dosing,safety and efficacy information in the package insert, this is not the case for children.

 The purpose of this study is to determine how fast the drug is cleared from the body, the correct dose, and long-term safety and efficacy for children with spasticity.
