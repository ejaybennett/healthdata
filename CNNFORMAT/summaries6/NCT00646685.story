(thirdQuint)Duct-to-duct vs Roux-en-y Hepaticojejunostomy for Biliary Reconstruction in Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of biliary complications (bile leaks and strictures) following duct-to-duct and roux-en-y biliary reconstruction during right lobe living donor liver transplantation.

 Biliary complications are much more common with right lobe living donor liver grafts than with whole organ grafts and are considered a major limitation of this surgery.

 Two surgical techniques are currently used for biliary reconstruction and each has its advantages/disadvantages.

 However, it is unclear which technique leads to fewer biliary complications.

 Retrospective studies which examine biliary complication rates may be hampered by such factors as a surgeon's bias or inexperience with a particular technique.

 Therefore a prospective randomized trial is needed.

 Duct-to-duct vs Roux-en-y Hepaticojejunostomy for Biliary Reconstruction in Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether one of 2 surgical techniques commonly used for bile duct reconstruction during living donor liver transplantation results in fewer biliary complications.

 Also, this study may identify patient group(s) that particularly benefit from a particular technique.
