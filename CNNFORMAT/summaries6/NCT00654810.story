(secondQuint)Exercise Rehabilitation of Younger and Older People With Claudication.

 Thirty-one patients randomized to low-intensity exercise rehabilitation and 33 patients randomized to high-intensity exercise rehabilitation completed the study.

 The 6-month exercise rehabilitation programs consisted of intermittent treadmill walking to near maximal claudication pain three days per week at either 40% (low-intensity group) or 80% (high-intensity group) of maximal exercise capacity.

 Total work performed in the two training regimens was similar by having the patients in the low-intensity group exercise for a longer duration than patients in the high-intensity group.

 Measurements of physical function, peripheral circulation, and health-related quality of life were obtained on each patient before and after the rehabilitation programs.
