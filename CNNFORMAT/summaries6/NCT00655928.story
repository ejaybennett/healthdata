(secondQuint)Modulation of Lung Injury Complicating Lung Resection.

 Acute lung injury occurs following lung resection in about 5% cases, and has a high mortality of around 50%.

 Management of these patients is largely supportive.

 Even in patients who do not develop clinical evidence of acute lung injury, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress are present in blood and exhaled breath condensate after lung resection.

 The purpose of this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study is to determine whether lung injury can be prevented by pre-administration of N-acetylcysteine.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether N-acetylcysteine given intravenously 1 day pre-operatively is effective in preventing inflammation in the lungs, as measured by tests on blood, breath and lung specimens, in patients undergoing surgery to remove a portion of lung.
