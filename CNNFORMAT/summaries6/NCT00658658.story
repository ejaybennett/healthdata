(firstQuint)Panitumumab in Children With Solid Tumors.

 This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm, dose-ranging, clinical study.

 Panitumumab will be administered by intravenous infusion to 4-6 patients per cohort.

 Three planned cohorts, stratified by age, will be studied at 100% of the recommended panitumumab dose for each treatment schedule as defined in adults.

 Enrollment will start with a 2.

5 mg/kg once weekly administration to the 12 to 33% incidence of a dose limiting toxicity during the evaluation period.

 Subsequent cohorts of 6.

0 mg/kg once every two weeks to the 1 to < 12 year old patients and 9.

0 mg/kg once every three weeks to both age groups will open once sufficient safety in each cohort is determined.

 Participants may stay on study treatment until disease progression.
