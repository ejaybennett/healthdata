(firstQuint)Exploring the Relationship Between Varying CO2 Levels and the Regional BOLD Signal, by Using Breathing Exercises.

 Among many parameters effecting cerebral blood flow(CBF), partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) in arterial blood has a significant effect.

 A small increase in arterial PaCO2 level will cause a significant increase of CBF , followed by increase of O2 level .

 The main objective is to explore the effect of arterial PaCO2 level on regional CBF and brain O2 level, by using breathing exercises to modulate arterial PaCO2.

 The regional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal produced by MRI , will indicate the regional O2 level.

The purpose of this study is to explore how arterial PaCO2 effect regional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, and indirectly the brain regional O2 level .
