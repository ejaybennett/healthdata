(thirdQuint)RFT5-dgA Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Cutaneous T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CTCL) following treatment with RFT5-dgA immunotoxin (anti-CD25 immunotoxin IMTOX25) .

 Secondary - Determine whether responses correlate with the level of CD25+ expression on the CTCL tumor cells.

 - Determine whether changes in the pre-treatment and the post-treatment levels of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells correlate with responses.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-CD25 immunotoxin IMTOX25 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.

 Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Tissue and blood samples are collected at baseline, and during study for CD25+ expression by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis, immunohistochemistry.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

RATIONALE: Immunotoxins, such as RFT5-dgA immunotoxin (also called anti-CD25 immunotoxin IMTOX25), can find certain cancer cells and kill them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of anti-CD25 immunotoxin IMTOX25 and how well it works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
