(thirdQuint)Copper T380 IUD Versus Oral Levonorgestrel for Emergency Contraception vs.

 Plan B for Emergency Contraception.

 This study seeks to estimate the acceptance of Copper IUD use amongst people presenting for EC.

 This will be accomplished by offering all women who present for EC at participating Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU) clinics during the study period the option of having the copper IUD or Plan B.

 Women who agree to study participation will be followed for 6 months.

 The primary outcome for the study is the use of a reliable method of contraception 6 months after presenting for EC.

 Secondary outcomes measured will be pregnancies, abortions, repeat Plan B use, presence of gonorrhea or Chlamydia infection at the time of presentation for EC, number of days to first bleeding episode and duration of that bleeding episode, further bleeding patterns, frequency of unprotected intercourse, use of a barrier method for prevention of sexually transmitted infections, patient satisfaction with the chosen method and symptoms possibly related to contraception use.

 Patients selecting the IUD will be assessed for IUD expulsion, perforation, and removal.
