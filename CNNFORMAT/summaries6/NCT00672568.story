(secondQuint)Safety and Tolerability of 4975 in Patients Undergoing Arthroscopic Surgery to Repair the Rotator Cuff of the Shoulder.

 This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage exploratory study in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery.

 Stage 1) Patients will be randomized to receive either 4975 or placebo.

 The dose of 4975 will be escalated in a protocolized manner based on safety and tolerability.

 Stage 2) Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the selected dose of 4975 or placebo.

 All patients will be observed in the hospital for at least two days following surgery for safety, tolerability, and efficacy assessments.

 In addition there will be two planned follow-up visits after hospital discharge.
