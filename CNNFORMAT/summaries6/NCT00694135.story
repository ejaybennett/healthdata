(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Iontophoresis and Dexamethasone Phosphate to Treat Anterior Uveitis.

 This is a randomized, double-masked, parallel group, dose-comparison, exploratory study of four doses of iontophoretic delivery of dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution in patients with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis.

 The current study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of this technology at the four dose levels to determine a safe effective dose appropriate for future trials.
