(secondQuint)Study of CGC-11047 (PG-11047) in Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors.

 This is an open-label phase I, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory solid tumors.

 The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PG-11047.

 PG-11047 will be administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle.

 The planned minimum treatment schedule is 2 cycles (8 weeks) of PG-11047 treatment.

 Subjects who tolerate treatment may be eligible to receive additional cycles as per investigator's medical judgment.

 Evaluation of anti-tumor response will be performed every 2 cycles.

This phase I study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of a new drug - PG-11047 - and to establish what happens to the drug once inside the body.

 An escalating dose of PG-11047 will be investigated in this study and the maximum tolerated dose of the drug will be established.
