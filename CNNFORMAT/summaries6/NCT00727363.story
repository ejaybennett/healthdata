(thirdQuint)Prophylactic Probiotics in Premature Infants.

 Neonatal infections currently cause about 1.

6 million deaths annually in developing countries.

 Preterm infants are especially vulnerable to infections because of their immature immune responses and their exposure to the hospital milieu which promotes gastrointestinal colonization with Gram-negative pathogens.

 Multiple studies have shown that the colonization of the bowel with probiotics (nonpathogenic anaerobic bacteria) competitively inhibit the attachment of Gram-negative pathogens decreasing their likelihood for bacterial translocation and the development of life threatening infections.

This potentially high-impact, low-cost intervention may significantly improve the survival and morbidity of preterm infants around the world.

 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE We seek to determine whether prophylactic administration of Lactobacillus reuteri decreases the incidence of death and nosocomial sepsis among susceptible preterm infants in a neonatal care setting in Colombia.

 Specific aims: 1.

 To investigate the efficacy and safety of oral Lactobacillus reuteri for the primary endpoint prevention of death or nosocomial sepsis in preterm infants through a well powered multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT).

 2.

 To assess the impact of Lactobacillus reuteri on four secondary endpoints: necrotizing enterocolitis, prevalence of Gram-negative pathogens, duration of hospitalization, and frequency of outpatient treatment and re-admission for infectious causes at 6 months post-discharge.

 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Study Design: Overview Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial Primary outcome: Death or nosocomial sepsis Secondary outcomes: NEC, prevalence of Gram-negative pathogens, duration of hospitalization, and frequency of outpatient treatment and re-admission for infectious causes at 6 months post-discharge.

 Post-hoc analysis will evaluate differences in RCT outcomes in two key subgroups: breast-fed and formula-fed infants and vaginal delivery versus cesarean section, in both probiotic exposed and unexposed infants.

 In addition, we will look at death and nosocomial sepsis as separate outcomes to ensure there is no differential effect of treatment in either outcome.

 Location: 11 NICUs in Colombia.

 Randomization and Stratification: Stratification according to participating institutions will be done in order to control for center-related differences.

 Stratification by birth weight will be performed in 2 groups: 50% of previous feeding with abdominal distension or the presence of macroscopic blood in stools).

 In situations where feeds have been temporarily discontinued, patients may re-enter the study at the initiation of feeds.

 Patients who develop NEC may continue in the study if they are able to resume feeds after treatment.

 Inotropic support, if being weaned, is not a contraindication to begin or continue the protocol.

 Administration of probiotic will end at discharge, but the infant's status will continue to be monitored until 6 months post-discharge.

 Patient's participation in the study will end at 6 months post-discharge, or upon the death of the patient.

 Prophylactic Probiotics in Premature Infants@highlight

This study tries to determine whether the oral administration of a specific probiotic (good bacteria) in premature infants hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit may prevent infections and the development of a severe inflammatory disease of the bowel called necrotizing enterocolitis.

 The investigators propose that premature infants not given probiotics will colonize their gut with bad bacterias and develop infection.
