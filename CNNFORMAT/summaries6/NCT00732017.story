(secondQuint)Effects Of High Voltage Pulsed Current On Post-Traumatic Injuries.

 Most studies have investigated the effects of HVPC on edema in animals and only one in humans was identified.

 The studies had showed that HVPC had some advantages for controlling edema in animals but there are not yet conclusive results on the effect of this intervention in humans.

For this reason, we proposed a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial with three groups of intervention.

 In our study compared the effects of standard physical therapy treatment with the HVPC with negative and positive polarity.

The investigators hypothesis is that HVPC with negative polarity diminishes local post-traumatic edema in ankle sprains.

 Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of HVPC on edema secondary to ankle sprains in humans.
