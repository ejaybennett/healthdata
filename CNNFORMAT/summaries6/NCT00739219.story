(firstQuint)Management of Asthma Patients Guided by Exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO).

 Patients with persistent, moderate to severe asthma will be randomized to receive therapy guided by either eNO and clinical standard of care (eNO group) or clinical standard of care (control group).

 An eNO treatment algorithm will be established for each patient in the eNO group at Baseline (Visit 1).

 Enrollment is estimated to be six months with a follow up period of twelve months.
