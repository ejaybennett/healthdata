(fifthQuint)Effect of Intravitreal Ranibizumab on Radiation Retinopathy Following Plaque Brachytherapy for Choroidal Melanoma.

 Following plaque brachytherapy as treatment for choroidal melanoma, patients may develop radiation retinopathy.

 Radiation retinopathy is a progressive condition that leads to blindness in over 50% of cases within 5 years of treatment.

 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein is believed to play a critical role in angiogenesis and radiation retinopathy.

 It is one of the key contributors to physiological or pathological conditions that can stimulate both the formation of new blood vessels and normal vessel incompetence.

 Ranibizumab is a recently approved vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor shown to be effective in treating exudative macular degeneration.

 Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis.

 This is an open label, non-randomized active treatment, Phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intravitreal ranibizumab and its ability to reduce radiation retinopathy and potentially limit vision loss associated with this disease.

 Effect of Intravitreal Ranibizumab on Radiation Retinopathy Following Plaque Brachytherapy for Choroidal Melanoma@highlight

This is a Phase I clinical trial to test the safety and tolerability of intravitreal ranibizumab in the treatment of radiation retinopathy following plaque brachytherapy for patients with choroidal melanoma using the incidence and severity of events criteria.

 The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab on regression of radiation retinopathy by ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as visual acuity.
