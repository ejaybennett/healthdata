(secondQuint)Structural and Functional Left Ventricular Remodelling in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 Several studies have been suggesting that Obstructive Sleep Apnea contributes to deterioration of left ventricular diastolic function.

 It may be associated to increased risk of cardiovascular events.

 We hypothesized that morphological and functional left ventricular changes might be reverted after treatment with Continuous positive airway pressure.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea have any changes in left ventricular function and structure after 06 months of continuous positive airway pressure treatment.
