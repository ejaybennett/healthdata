(thirdQuint)Bioequivalence Study of Metformin Hydrochloride Liquid 500mg/ 5 mL Under Fed Conditions.

 This was an open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose crossover bioavailability study performed on 36 healthy adult male and female non-smoking or light smoking volunteers and 2 alternates.

 A total of 36 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study.

 In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw.

 Single oral 1000 mg doses were separated by a washout period of 7 days Of the 36 healthy adult non-smoking or light-smoking (10 cigarettes/day) volunteers and 2 alternates (19 males, 19 non-pregnant females) enrolled in the study, two did not complete the clinical phase of the study.

 Subject No.

 11 was withdrawn from the study by the on-duty Physician after a positive pregnancy test prior to dosing in Period 2 and Subject No.

 20 was withdrawn from the study by the Clinical Study Manager after she failed to complete her breakfast prior to dosing in Period 2.
