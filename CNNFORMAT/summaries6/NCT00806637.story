(thirdQuint)Vessel Sealing System Uvulopalatoplasty Versus Uvulopalatal Flap.

 Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is one of the common procedures performed by otolaryngologists to treat sleep-disordered breathing patients who have retropalatal obstruction.

 Intraoperative bleeding is a significant problem which requires hemostasis and causes prolonged operative time.

 Several different techniques are used to perform this operation, including cold knife, monopolar cautery, coblation, and radiofrequency.

 Efficacy in hemostasis and tissue trauma from different operative techniques may result in different operative time and different degrees of morbidity including intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, postoperative hemorrhage, and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).

 The vessel sealing system has been widely used in head and neck surgery because of its effectiveness and safety.

 It was also found quite effective and safe in tonsillectomy procedures, providing excellent hemostasis and minimal tissue trauma.

 Vessel Sealing System Uvulopalatoplasty Versus Uvulopalatal Flap@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare vessel sealing system uvulopalatoplasty (VSSU) to the traditional uvulopalatal flap (UPF) in the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing with special regard to intraoperative bleeding, operative time, postoperative pain, postoperative hemorrhage and other adverse effects.
