(fifthQuint)Clinical Performance Evaluation of Pediatric and Neonatal Low Saturation Oximetry Sensors.

 1.

0 BACKGROUND A common method for assessing the respiratory status of hospitalized pediatric and neonatal patients is the use of pulse oximetry.

 This noninvasive device uses a light emitting diode (LED) emitter, which is applied to an area of the body with good local blood flow.

 Red and infrared light is shined through the blood-perfused tissue under the sensor and the detected light information is sent back to a signal processing unit, or monitor, for calculation of oxygen saturation (SpO2)1.

 Typically the sensor may be placed either on the forehead, a finger, or in neonates - the foot, palm or toe.

 Use of this noninvasive method provides continuous information on the oxygenation status of patients and has greatly reduced the number of arterial blood gas punctures or samples required for patient care.

 While the advantages of noninvasive pulse oximetry are significant, there are a number of factors that can negatively impact the performance of the device2.

 Patient monitoring during low saturation episodes has been one of the challenges to optimal device performance.

 Improvements to sensor technology over the last 20 years have progressively improved the accuracy and reliability of the device.

 Since their introduction to clinical care in the 1980's, a number of improvements have been made to increase the accuracy of pulse oximetry in oxygen saturations of 80% and below.

 Nonetheless, while much of the clinical research on pulse oximetry sensors over the years has evaluated device accuracy and reliability, limited data are available in these conditions1,6.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of new pulse oximetry sensors specifically designed for low saturation episodes in pediatric and neonatal patients.

 Results of this study will provide basic information to drive further improvements in the technology.

0 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The general purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and performance of pediatric and neonatal oximetry sensors over clinically relevant ranges of arterial saturations between 60-100%.

 The study objectives are as follows: 1.

 To evaluate the accuracy of a neonatal sensor in the saturation range of 70-80% in the following weight category: 0-5kg.

 2.

 To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand) sensors in the saturation range of 60-80% in the following weight categories: 0-5kg; and, 5-40kg.

 3.

 To evaluate the accuracy of neonatal and pediatric transmission (digit/foot/hand) sensors in the saturation range of 80-100% in the following weight ranges: 0-5kg; and, 5-40kg.

 These objectives will be achieved by enrolling hospitalized patients from several neonatal and pediatric units, including cardiac cath lab, OR and intensive care areas.

0, Risk Analysis.

 All reportable anticipated, and unanticipated, adverse events will be documented on the Adverse Event Form.

0 RISK ANALYSIS The risks to participation in this study are primarily physical.

 Involvement in this study requires the addition of two additional pulse oximetry sensors to the extremities of the subjects.

 There are no psychological, social, economic, legal or other risks that have been identified.

 We believe that the risks from the devices and the study procedure are non-significant.

 Physical risks from the use of the devices may consist principally of a burn to the skin.

 Pulse oximetry sensors are attached to the fingers or other skin surfaces, and use light to measure saturation, generating a small amount of heat.

 Because of the low amount of current required to power the LED's, risk of burn is minimal.

 The long history of safe performance of Nellcor and Masimo Pulse Oximetry in the marketplace is evidence that this risk is very low.

 In addition, the short duration of this study makes this risk extremely unlikely.

 The application and removal of oximetry or other non-invasive tissue sensors present a minimal risk to the subject.

 There may be minor discomfort associated with removal of adhesive sensors or a reaction to the standard adhesive.

 Injury from a reaction to a sensor adhesive is rare.

0 BENEFITS There are no direct benefits to subjects who participate in these studies.

 Benefits from the study will be the overall improvement of patient care, as a sensor can be developed which is expected to be accurate and reliable in reporting saturations below the 80% saturation range.

 Future patients will benefit from the accurate and reliable products that are developed using the procedure described above.

0 STATEMENT OF NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK Nellcor believes that this is a "non-significant risk" device study due to the nature of the devices being tested.

 Utilizing the information presented in Section 9.

0 and the FDA criteria listed below to distinguish between significant and non-significant risk devices, Nellcor has determined that the devices referred to in the Protocol present no potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and are NOT: 1.

 Implants; or 2.

 Used in supporting or sustaining human life; or 3.

 Substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in preventing impairment of human health.

 Nellcor requests that the IRB indicate its agreement with this determination of risk in its letter of approval for this study.

 11.

0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS No therapeutic modifications are proposed in this study.

 Written informed consent will be obtained from each participating patient.

 If the patient is a minor, written informed consent will be obtained from the subject's parents or legal guardian(s) and their permission sought for participation in this study.

 Federal policies for protection of human subjects will be followed at all times8.

 12.

0 CONFIDENTIALITY Subject confidentiality will be kept at all times.

 Patient records may be made available to employees from Nellcor and the United States of America Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for data review only.

 The results of this study may be presented at meetings or in publications; however, subject identity will not be disclosed.
