(thirdQuint)Changing Lifestyles for Better Health.

 This project is a clinical outcome study that merges the expertise of a senior Yale clinical investigator, the clinical and translational research resources of YCCI, the clinical and community expertise of the FHCHC Diabetes Team, and the high-need patient population of FHCHC.

 In addition to determining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an ILI for diabetes prevention in an inner-city community health center setting, this project will evaluate the effectiveness of pooling academic expertise with direct clinical services to disadvantaged, at-risk populations.
