(secondQuint)Safety/Feasibility of Autologous Mononuclear Bone Marrow Cells in Stroke Patients.

 Our primary hypothesis is that autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation by intravenous administration is feasible and safe after acute ischemic stroke.

 Our secondary hypothesis is that autologous transplantation is associated with improved outcome after acute stroke.

 Safety/Feasibility of Autologous Mononuclear Bone Marrow Cells in Stroke Patients@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to find out if bone marrow treatment (bone marrow aspiration and infusion of stem cells) can be safely used in adults who have recently (within 24-72 hours)suffered an acute ischemic stroke.
