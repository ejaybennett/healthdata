(fifthQuint)Personalized Letter With Cancer Information Service Support or a Standard Reminder Letter in Women Scheduled for Colposcopy After an Abnormal Pap Test.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the effect of a usual care mailing intervention vs a Cancer Information Service (CIS) support mailing intervention on the likelihood that women with an abnormal Pap test will keep their medical follow-up appointments and be satisfied with how they talk to their provider.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

 - Arm I (Usual-care mailing intervention): Patients receive a generic letter reminding them of their follow-up colposcopy appointment.

 - Arm II (Cancer Information Service [CIS] support mailing intervention): Patients receive a targeted letter reminding them of their follow-up colposcopy appointment, asking them or someone they designate to call the CIS, and suggesting some questions to ask the CIS about colposcopies and Pap tests.

 At their follow-up appointments, all patients undergo an exit interview to compare patient satisfaction between the 2 interventions.

 Patients in arm II also answer questions about their CIS experience, and if the intervention made their follow-up visit less difficult.

 Personalized Letter With Cancer Information Service Support or a Standard Reminder Letter in Women Scheduled for Colposcopy After an Abnormal Pap Test@highlight

RATIONALE: Receiving a reminder letter from their doctor with questions to ask the Cancer Information Service may be more effective than a standard reminder letter in helping patients who have had an abnormal Pap test keep their follow-up colposcopy appointment.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying a personalized letter with Cancer Information Service support to see how well it works compared with a standard reminder letter in women scheduled for colposcopy after an abnormal Pap test.
