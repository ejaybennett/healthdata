(secondQuint)The Efficacy of Doxazosin for Cocaine Users.

 The NE system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important role in cocaine addiction in humans.

 The results of this study will provide medical safety data on the duration of the induction schedule that will be optimal for attaining our target dose of 8 mg doxazosin daily and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related alpha 1 receptor antagonists for cocaine addiction.

 This 17-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 4 week washout period(weeks 14-17).

 Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

 Subjects will be receiving 1 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 1mg/week induction rate for 8 weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on these agents through week 13.

 At the end of the study (weeks 14-17), participants will undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 4-week period.

 Subjects who wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or treatment-research program will be helped with referral during the 4 week period (weeks 14-17).
