(secondQuint)Chloride High Level Of Resuscitation Infusion Chloride High Level Of Resuscitation Infusion Delivered Evaluation.

 This is a prospective, controlled, before-and-after study.

 The baseline pre-intervention period will include collection of data while doctors and nurses are unaware that such collection is taking place.

 During this time, high chloride fluids (saline, Gelofusine, 4% albumin) will continue to be used according to standard practice with an estimated 30,000 liters of saline as well as 2,000 bottles of Gelofusine(R) being consumed.

 Following a wash out period of education and preparation, there will be a complete shift to a working environment where use of saline, Gelofusine and any other fluids with a high chloride level (>110 mmol/L)will be restricted and substituted with fluids of lower chloride concentration similar to blood; either Hartmann's solution or Plasmalyte(R) or 20% albumin.

 The study will compare a 6 month control period (before) and a six month intervention period (after).

The purpose of this study is to determine whether intravenous fluid management using lower chloride solutions (Hartmann's solutions and Plasmalyte(R)) will result in better outcome when compared to management using high chloride solutions (0.

9% saline and Gelofusine(R)).
