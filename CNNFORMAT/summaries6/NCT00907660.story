(thirdQuint)A Randomized Trial Comparing Two Doses of Portion-Controlled Foods Within a Primary Care Weight Loss Program.

 The study has two goals.

 First, it will assess the efficacy of a weight loss program, using a combination of counseling by peer weight coaches and portion-controlled foods.

 Second, the study will test the effect of varying the "dose" of portion-controlled foods provided to patients by randomly assigning individuals to receive half or all of the food required to follow a meal replacement regimen.

 The primary endpoint of the study will be weight change.

 Secondary endpoints will include adherence to the recommended eating plan, health-related quality of life, as well as changes in waist circumference and blood pressure.

 The provision of "half-dose" portion-controlled foods (1 meal per day) is hypothesized to be non-inferior to provision of "full-dose" (2 meals per day).

 The goal of non-inferiority is important because it can demonstrate that health care payers wishing to support weight loss programs can achieve equivalent results at a lower cost.

 All patients have the choice regarding their use of portion-controlled foods in the study, and no patients will be asked to leave the study because of non-adherence.

We hypothesize that individuals provided with 1 meal per day of portion-controlled foods (shakes and prepared entrees) will lose as much weight as individuals provided with 2 meals per day of portion-controlled foods.

 The study is designed to assess whether equal weight loss can be achieved at a lower cost to the health care system (or health care payer), with patients contributing some of the cost of their own treatment.
