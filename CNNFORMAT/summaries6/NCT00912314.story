(fifthQuint)Trial of Maintenance Therapy With Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Overactive Bladder.

 This study has two parts: an observational study of PTNS (Part 1) and a randomized, controlled trial of maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS (Part 2).

 Part 1: This is an observational study of the efficacy of PTNS therapy in women with bothersome OAB symptoms who have failed anticholinergic therapy.

 Subjects will be offered a standardized weekly regimen of PTNS for 12 weeks and asked to respond to surveys before and after treatment.

 Pre- and post- intervention assessments will include a 3-day diary to assess voiding volume and frequency, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q short form bother),and the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form (Urogenital Distress Inventory UDI 6 subset).

 Post-intervention assessment will include the above, as well as the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I).

 Part 2: After the initial 12-week treatment, all women with PGI-I less than 4, defined as patient perception of bladder function as better, much better, or very much better after the treatment than before the treatment, will be randomized to monthly PTNS or no PTNS.

 Part 2 of the study will continue for an additional 42 weeks (i.

e.

 52 weeks total in parts 1 and 2).

 Subjects will be considered to have failed therapy if their PGI-I score is greater than 3.

 If they are currently receiving PTNS maintenance therapy and have a PGI-I score greater than 3, they will be withdrawn from the study and transferred to clinical care to pursue other treatment options.

 If they are in the no maintenance arm and have a PGI-I score greater than 3, then they are considered to have failed the no-maintenance treatment arm and may receive monthly PTNS treatment or pursue other treatment if they choose .

 Study questionnaires will be administered to patients at clinic visits.

 PGI-I questionnaires will be administered via mail (followed by a phone call if the questionnaire is not received within a designated amount of time).

 Sequence of Events Part 1: Initial urogynecology visit with history and physical (part of routine care).

 Identify patients interested in PTNS Offer participation in this study, at which point the subject visit transitions from routine care to a research visit.

 Complete questionnaires and diaries to confirm inclusion criteria for those patients who opt to participate in this study.

 Weekly PTNS sessions with nurse certified in PTNS administration for 12 weeks Telephone reminder to complete 3-day prospective voiding diary prior to MD visit.

 In-person clinic visit with MD at end of 12-week treatment.

 Part 2: Clinic visit with MD at end of 12-week PTNS treatment, with administration of questionnaires.

 If PGI-I 3 in the group assigned to maintenance PTNS compared to the group not assigned to maintenance via chi-squared analysis.

 A cox regression model may be used to analyze time to failure on maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS.

 Other statistical and qualitative analyses will be performed on secondary outcome measures as appropriate.

 Trial of Maintenance Therapy With Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Overactive Bladder@highlight

This study has 2 parts.

 Part 1 is a 12-week observational study of weekly Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) treatment for women with overactive bladder.

 Part 2 is a randomized, controlled trial of monthly maintenance PTNS therapy versus no therapy in subjects who were successfully treated by PTNS in Part 1.

 Part 1: 12-week observational study of weekly PTNS treatment.

 The primary aim of Part 1 is to determine the efficacy of a 12-week course of PTNS in the treatment of overactive bladder.

 Secondary aims are to determine the changes in voiding frequency and quality-of-life measures after the 12-week treatment.

 Part 2: Randomized, controlled study of monthly PTNS compared to no PTNS after 12-week treatment The primary aim is to determine time-to-failure after 12 weeks of PTNS in subjects who receive maintenance therapy compared to those who do not, in order to ascertain if there is a need for maintenance therapy after 12 weeks of PTNS.

 The investigators' secondary aims are to compare the long-term efficacy and quality of life impact in patient receiving maintenance PTNS compared to those that do not and to determine the efficacy of rescue maintenance PTNS in subjects who have symptom recurrence in the no maintenance therapy arm.

 Hypothesis: There will be no difference in time to failure between women randomized to monthly maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS.
