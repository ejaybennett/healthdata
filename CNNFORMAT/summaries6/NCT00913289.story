(thirdQuint)Liver Regeneration Therapy Using Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Stromal Cells.

 The population of the liver cirrhosis patients is enormous in Japan and the only radical treatment for them is liver transplantation.

 However, the number of giving donors is extremely limited.

 Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as hepatocytes.

 They reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues.

 The latter tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells.

 In this study, the cirrhotic patients will receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells which contains substantial number of mesenchymal stem cells.

Mesenchymal stem cells have the capability to differentiate into hepatocytes and will be useful for liver regeneration.

 Adipose tissue is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow tissue.

 In this trial, eligible liver cirrhosis patients will receive autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells which include such mesenchymal stem cells.
