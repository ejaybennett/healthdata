(firstQuint)Genotype and Phenotype Registry: Enrollment of Normal Control Subjects for Current and Future Research.

 The registry is a collection of volunteers willing to participate as control subjects in research studies.

 Control subjects are people who do not have a specific disease; therefore they can serve a critical role as a comparison with people who have the disease or other characteristic being studied.

 Once registered, participants will be notified about studies they may be able to participate in as a control.

 Participation requires: 1.

 signing a consent form 2.

 answering a short health survey 3.

 providing a DNA sample via a mouthwash kit The registry allows scientists to select study participants based on whether or not they have a specific genetic change that may be relevant to a disease under investigation.

 Having the ability to access controls when needed is an extremely valuable resource that will speed up scientific discoveries.
