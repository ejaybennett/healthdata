(thirdQuint)Carotid Intima-media Thickness (IMT) and Large-vessel Atherosclerosis by Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT).

 We evaluated mean/maximal carotid IMT in seventy-one type 2 diabetic subjects, and defined increased carotid IMT as maximal IMT 1.

0 mm.

 Multidetector CT (MDCT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were taken to evaluate carotid artery stenosis (CS), coronary artery disease (CAD), intracranial arterial lesion (ICA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

 We compared prevalence of large artery stenosis according to carotid IMT group and evaluated whether maximal IMT 1.

0 mm could predict for significant CAD by MDCT.

 We performed invasive coronary angiography in some patients (N=14) and analyzed association for degrees of CAD between two angiographic methods.

 Carotid Intima-media Thickness (IMT) and Large-vessel Atherosclerosis by Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT)@highlight

The aim of this study was to investigate whether carotid IMT can predict the presence of more advanced atherosclerosis such as carotid stenosis, coronary or intracranial artery disease by MDCT and whether MDCT could be useful next step for more aggressive treatment modality in Korean type 2 diabetic patients.
