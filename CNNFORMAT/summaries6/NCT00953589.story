(thirdQuint)480 STUDY: Phase 2b Study of Locteron Plus Ribavirin to Treat Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).

 The aim of the 480 STUDY was to compare efficacy and safety of 480ug Locteron dosed every other week to 1.

5 ug/kg PegIntron dosed weekly in treatment-naive genotype-1 chronic HCV subjects treated with weight-based ribavirin.

 This 12-week study was comprised of two panels (Panel A and Panel B).

 The designs of both panels were identical.

 HCV RNA was measured weekly for three weeks and then every other week.

 Adverse events including flu-like events and depression were collected during weekly clinic visits for 12 weeks.

 Flu-like events were also collected daily for 12 weeks by subject self-report using the internet (ePRO).

 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Short Form-36 scores were measured at baseline and monthly through Week 12.

 In Panel A of 480 STUDY, 42 treatment-naive subjects with chronic genotype-1 HCV in Bulgaria and Romania were randomized and dosed with either Locteron q2weeks or weekly PegIntron, both in combination with weight-based ribavirin (13).

 In Panel A, 19 subjects received 480ug Locteron and 23 subjects received PegIntron.

 In Panel B of 480 STUDY, 32 treatment-naive subjects with genotype-1 HCV in Israel were randomized and dosed with either Locteron q2weeks or weekly PegIntron, both in combination with weight-based ribavirin (13).

 In Panel B, 16 subjects received 480ug Locteron and 16 subjects received PegIntron.

 480 STUDY: Phase 2b Study of Locteron Plus Ribavirin to Treat Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)@highlight

The purpose of this 12-week study was to assess in subjects with chronic hepatitis C (treatment-naive, genotype 1) receiving weight-based doses of ribavirin the early virologic response to the 480 ug dose level of Locteron cent , dosed every 2 weeks, in comparison with 1.

5 ug/kg PEG-Intron cent dosed weekly.
