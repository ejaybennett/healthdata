(firstQuint)Photobiomodulation to Alter Cerebral Blood Flow and to Affect the Emotional Status of Patients With Major Depression.

 We wish to study whether photobiomodulation (PBM) with near infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LED), a non-ionizing phototherapy, in patients with major depression, can acutely alter frontal brain blood flow measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

 Secondarily, we will examine whether PBM can improve emotional state immediately and over the following month.

 We see this as a pilot study to gather preliminary data that will guide future studies.
