(secondQuint)Dose-ranging Study of a Single Administration of T-cell Add-back Depleted of Host Alloreactive Cells in Patients Undergoing a Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant From a Related, Haploidentical Donor.

 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for many patients with leukemia and other hematologic malignancies.

 However, a major limitation of this therapy is that for a significant number of patients no fully HLA-matched donor can be found.

 The application of partially HLA-matched (haploidentical) family donors, who are virtually always available, has some complications.

 If there is no T-cell add-back it increases the risk for life-threatening infections and disease relapse, while in case of T-cell add-back the risk of graft-versus-host disease is raised.

 Kiadis Pharma has developed a method to selectively deplete host alloreactive T-cells through photodynamic therapy, using TH9402 ex vivo.

 The donor lymphocyte preparation depleted of functional alloreactive T-cells (ATIR) are administered to the patient 4-6 weeks after the stem cell transplant.

 This method enables early immune reconstitution while preventing graft-versus-host disease.

The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and evaluate the safety of the administration of donor lymphocytes depleted of alloreactive T-cells following a stem cell transplant from a related, haploidentical donor, in patients with severe hematologic malignancies.
