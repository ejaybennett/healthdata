(thirdQuint)Studying DNA in Tissue Samples From Caucasian and African-American Cancer Patients Who Received Docetaxel on Clinical Trial CLB-9871.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the genotype of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 2 (ABCC2) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1B3 (SLCO1B3) (and other genes potentially relevant in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel in the future) in Caucasian and African-American cancer patients enrolled on clinical trial CLB-9871.

 II.

 Explore the relationships between these genotypes and docetaxel pharmacokinetic parameters (e.

g.

, area under curve [AUC], steady-state volume of distribution [Vdss]).

 OUTLINE: Blood samples collected on clinical trial CLB-9871 are examined via ABCC2 and SLC01B3 genotyping using TaqMan analysis.

 Other genes related to the pharmacokinetics and side effects of docetaxel may be considered for future genotyping.

 In some cases, panels of drug response single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on high-density arrays may be genotyped.

 Studying DNA in Tissue Samples From Caucasian and African-American Cancer Patients Who Received Docetaxel on Clinical Trial CLB-9871@highlight

This research trial studies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood samples from Caucasian and African-American cancer patients who received docetaxel on clinical trial CLB-9871.

 Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors learn more about how docetaxel is used by the body.
