 INTRODUCTION 2.

 BACKGROUND 2.

1.

1.

 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is a common, often "silent" liver disease which affects about 2%-5% of Americans4-6.

 NASH is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, diabetes type-2 and obesity and can lead to cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplantation or death.

 The only mean for proving a diagnosis of NASH and separating it from simple fatty liver is liver biopsy (an invasive procedure which carries a certain degree of risk).

 Currently, there is no effective treatment for NASH7.

 The effect of Hyperimmune Bovine Colostrum on NASH Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are recognized as an important immunomodulatory component of the adaptive immune system.

 Immune dysregulation may lead to chronic inflammation, triggering chronic insulin insensitivity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

 The role of Tregs in the adipose tissue in the regulation of NASH was not previously studied.

 Aim: To assess the effects of Tregs stimulation on hepatic injury and insulin resistance in NASH.

 Methods: Leptin deficient Ob/Ob mice were fed for 4 weeks with colostrum derived solutions (CDS) enriched with anti insulin specific antibodies (AIS-CDS, Immuron, Australia), or with purified anti insulin specific CDS (PAIS-CDS).

 The immunologic effect on the adipose tissue was determined by flow cytometry performed on the central adipose tissue and its stromal vasculature (SV), and compared with the effect on immune system of the liver and the spleen.

 Hepatic injury and insulin resistance was determined by glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and liver enzymes.

 Results: Oral administration of anti-insulin antibodies promoted the SV CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells (13.

 Treatment was associated with a decrease of the CD4+IL17+ lymphocyte subset in the adipose tissue (87.

 If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study volunteer must agree that two reliable methods of contraception will be used simultaneously while receiving the protocol-specified medication and for 1 month after stopping the medication.

 NOTE: Hormonal-based methods alone are not sufficient.

 At least two of the following methods MUST be used appropriately unless documentation of menopause, sterilization, or azoospermia is present: - Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent.

 - Condoms are recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV transmission - Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide - IUD - Hormonal-based contraception Study subjects who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached menarche or women who have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.

 Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff is required by one of the following: - Physician report/letter - Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a laboratory report of azoospermia is required to document successful vasectomy) - Discharge summary - Laboratory report of azoospermia - FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory.

 2.

 STUDY TREATMENT a.

 REGIMEN, ADMINISTRATION AND DURATION i.

 Per-protocol treatment regimen Subjects will receive treatment with BCP 1.

8 grams (3 capsules) for 4 weeks and will then be monitored off study treatment for an additional 4 weeks.

 ii.

 Study treatment modifications Dose reductions will not be allowed.

 All study drug modifications will be documented and recorded.

 b.

 STUDY PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PREPARATION The study medication is supplied at tablets packaged individually in blister packs.

 Each 1.

2 g tablet contains 600 mg of freeze-dried BCP from cows immunized to insulin as the only active component, in combination with excipients including silica colloidal anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and calcium carbonate.

 The product can be stored at room temperature and has a shelf life of 5 years.

 c.

 PHARMACY: PRODUCT SUPPLY, DISTRIBUTION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY i.

 Study product acquisition/distribution BCP will be supplied by Immuron, and will be stored and dispensed by the research pharmacies at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center.

 ii.

 Study product accountability The site pharmacist is required to maintain complete records of all study products.

 d.

 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS i.

 General guidelines There are no specific protocol-imposed restrictions on concomitant medications, other than stipulated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 Nonetheless, whenever a concomitant medication or study agent is initiated or a dose changed, investigators will review the concomitant medications' and study agents' most recent package inserts, investigator's brochures, or updated information from on-line sources to obtain the most current information on drug interactions, contraindications, and precautions.

 ii.

 Prohibited medications Use of the following medications for more than 3 days within 30 days of study entry: Insulin, immunosuppressives, immune modulators, anti-neoplastic agents, glucocorticoids.

 e.

 ADHERENCE ASSESSMENT At each visit, participants will be queried about the number of doses of study medication missed since the last visit.
