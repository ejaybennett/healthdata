(firstQuint)Depression and Self-care in Heart Failure.

 Comorbid depression is common in heart failure, but little is known about how to treat it.

 This randomized, controlled, efficacy trial will compare cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to usual care (UC) for depression in heart failure.

 CBT will be integrated with an intervention to improve heart failure self-care, because depression and inadequate self-care are thought to be interrelated problems.

 It will also be integrated with clinical attention to primary caregiver stress.

 Basic heart failure education will be provided to all participants.
