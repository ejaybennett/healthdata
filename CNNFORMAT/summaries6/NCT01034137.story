(fifthQuint)A Study of Tocilizumab and Methotrexate in Combination or as Monotherapy in Treatment-Nave Patients With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (double placebo) three-arm parallel group, comparative study.

 Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatments: - TCZ 8 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) + MTX (Group I: TCZ+MTX) - TCZ 8 mg/kg + placeboMTX (Group II: TCZ+placebo) - MTX + placeboTCZ (Group III: MTX+placebo) Randomization was stratified by participating center and baseline Disease Activity Score, scoring 28 joints (DAS28) level (5.

1).

 Patients were evaluated every 4 weeks and at each visit a decision on dosage changes was made based on efficacy parameters (DAS28) and occurrence of adverse events (AEs).

 Patients received MTX/placeboMTX in climbing dosages.

 Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was added when remission was not reached with the maximum tolerable dosage (MTD) of MTX/placeboMTX.

 If after 12 additional weeks remission was not reached, HCQ was stopped and replaced by standard of care therapy (in Group I) or placebo therapy was replaced by the corresponding verum resulting in TCZ+MTX combination therapy (in Groups II and III).

 In case remission was reached, MTX/placeboMTX and TCZ/placeboTCZ had to be decreased.

 Patients were followed for a maximum of 24 months.

 A Study of Tocilizumab and Methotrexate in Combination or as Monotherapy in Treatment-Nave Patients With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis@highlight

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare the efficacy with regard to sustained remission and safety of tocilizumab and methotrexate, in combination or as monotherapy, in treatment-naive patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.

 Patients will be randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus weekly methotrexate (po in ascending doses), or tocilizumab (8mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus placebo, or methotrexate plus placebo.

 Anticipated time on study treatment is 2 years, and target sample size is 300.
