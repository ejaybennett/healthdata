(thirdQuint)Intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotrophins (hCG) and Endometrial Treg Cells.

 Aim of the work: To study the effect of intrauterine injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on the endometrial T regulatory cells (Treg cells)and the electromicroscopic endometrial characteristics.

 Background: It has been demonstrated that regulatory T cells expand during pregnancy and are present at the feto-maternal interface at very early stages in pregnancy.

 Rational: Intrauterine injection of hCG around the time of implantation may increase endometrial Treg cells and improve implantation.

 Methods: Intrauterine injection of 100 IU hCG will be done followed by endometrial biopsy to check for Treg cells and pinopodes.

Intrauterine injection of hCG around the time of implantation may increase endometrial Treg cells and improve implantation.

 It has been demonstrated that regulatory T cells expand during pregnancy.

 hCG was found to be secreted by the embryo immediately after fertilization and has chemoattractant properties to Treg cells.
