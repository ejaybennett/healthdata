(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Physiotherapy Interventions for Patients With Parkinson's Disease.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable and progressive disease (Rubenis 2007).

 Current management include medical, neuro-surgical and non-pharmacological intervention.

 Physiotherapy is a major component in non-pharmacological interventions.

 Effective interventions including visual or auditory cues improves gait (Nieuwboer et al.

 2007), exercise is effective in improving balance (Hirsch et al 2003); intense treadmill training improves motor control, quality of life and walking speed so as to sustain improvement in gait speed and motor control post 4 weeks of treatment (Herman et al 2007).

 Patient with PD attending physiotherapy twice weekly, one and half hour for 12 weeks showed improvement in walking speed and Activities of Daily Living (Ellis et al 2005).

 However, the majority of focus on patients in the Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 to 3 and long term effect is lacking (Kwakkel et al 2007).

 A knowledge gap is present in the effectiveness of physiotherapy training of patients with Parkinson's disease in the more advanced stage of disease and long term effect is lacking.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the immediate, short-term & long-term clinical effects of physiotherapy training of patients with Parkinson's disease.

 The hypothesis is that compared to patient education alone, physiotherapy intervention for patients with Parkinson's disease leads to improve function and quality of life.

 Effectiveness of Physiotherapy Interventions for Patients With Parkinson's Disease@highlight

Parkinson's Disease is an incurable and progressive disease.

 Treatment includes medication and non-pharmacological intervention such as physiotherapy.

 Physiotherapy is a main component of non-pharmacological interventions.

 It includes exercise to strengthen the muscles; improves balance and walking, and adopts the use of visual cue training.

 Treatment has been found to be effective in patients with mild impairment up to 6 months post-treatment.

 The present study will investigate the effectiveness of treatment for patients with mild to moderate impairment for short term (3-month) and long term (1 year).

 The hypothesis is that compared to patient education alone, physiotherapy intervention for patients with Parkinson's disease leads to improve function and quality of life.
