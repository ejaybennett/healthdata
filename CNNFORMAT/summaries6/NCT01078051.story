(firstQuint)Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion (DECISION-CTO).

 Prospective, two arms, randomized multi-center trial in Asian-pacific region.

 Following angiography, patients with chronic total occlusion (more than 3 months) have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and eligible for stenting without any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) drug-eluting stent vs.

 b) optimal medical treatment.

 All patients will be followed for at least 3 year.
