(fifthQuint)The Impact of Just-in-time Information on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Discharges.

 The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the impact of providing "Just-in-Time" information, or physician educational material at the time of discharge, to primary care pediatricians caring for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) graduates.

 The material provided will be tailored to the needs of each infant.

 The educational material will be sent to the physicians via email and facsimile on the day of discharge, and a hard copy will be sent with the parents to bring to their first clinic appointment.

 Outcomes, including emergency room visits, hospital readmissions, deaths, missed appointments, and improvements in care in the areas of intervention will be assessed.

 Levels of physician comfort in caring for various disorders specific to NICU graduates will be assessed, and satisfaction with the discharge process will also be evaluated pre- and post- intervention.

 The Impact of Just-in-time Information on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Discharges@highlight

We, the investigators, will provide "Just-in-Time" information, physician educational material, to primary care pediatricians of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) graduates at the time of NICU discharge.

 We will follow the rate of adverse events (deaths, re-hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and missed appointments) for 6 months after NICU discharge.

 We will assess levels of physician comfort in caring for NICU specific diseases, as well as physician satisfaction with the discharge process.

 We hypothesize that the provision of "Just-in-Time" information will decrease the rate of adverse events, and make physicians more comfortable in caring for complicated NICU graduates, and more satisfied with the discharge process.
