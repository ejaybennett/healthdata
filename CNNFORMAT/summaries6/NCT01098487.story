(thirdQuint)A Longitudinal 2-year Bone Marrow Study of Eltrombopag in Previously Treated Adults, With Chronic Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).

 This is a phase IV, open-label safety study, designed to determine baseline levels of bone marrow fibers in previously treated adults with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)and to evaluate the long-term effect of eltrombopag on bone marrow reticulin and/or collagen fibers.

 The duration of the screening period is up to 8 weeks.

 Eltrombopag will be administered for at least 2-years followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

 Bone marrow biopsies will be performed at screening, after 1-year and 2-years of eltrombopag treatment, and at early withdrawal of treatment.

 The screening bone marrow biopsy should be performed within 8 weeks of planned start of study medication and the bone marrow biopsy block must be available for central laboratory processing.

 A Longitudinal 2-year Bone Marrow Study of Eltrombopag in Previously Treated Adults, With Chronic Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)@highlight

A open-label, multi-center 2-year safety study to ascertain the baseline levels of bone marrow fibers in previously treated adults with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and to evaluate the long-term effect of eltrombopag on bone marrow fibers.

 The study will also describe the long-term safety and tolerability of oral eltrombopag treatment in subjects with chronic ITP.
