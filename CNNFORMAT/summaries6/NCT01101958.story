(firstQuint)A Study of the Use of Chartis System to Optimize Subject Selection for Endobronchial Lung Volume Reduction (ELVR).

 This is a multi-center study which will enroll up to 120 patients.

 Subjects will undergo a Chartis Assessment prior to EBV treatment.

 The Chartis assessment will determine the presence or absence of collateral ventilation, a potential determining factor in the success of EBV therapy.

 This study is not randomized; all subjects are eligible to receive EBV Treatment, regardless of Chartis Assessment outcome.

 Follow-up data will only be collected on those patients that meet the Chartis inclusion criteria.
