(fifthQuint)How to Get a Better Dry Weight in End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Population for Improving Blood Pressure Control.

 End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a common clinical condition over the world.

 In this population, the prevalence of systemic hypertension is high and its adequate control can determinate the outcome.

 The first step for a good control of blood pressure is giving a dry weight for the patient.

 We can understand dry weight or target weight as that one which the patient feels comfortable and there aren't clinical signals of volemic overload as edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, jugular turgency, hepatomegalia.

 Classically, the dry weight is assessed based on clinical examination, blood pressure and experience of hemodialysis staff.

 The electrical bioimpedance is a very simple method that possibilities access the corporal compartments, including the body water, using a small and not expensive portable device.

 Trying to study new forms for getting the ideal dry weight, we design a randomized clinical trial for evaluating two ways of getting a dry weight for hemodialysis patients.

 One group will be dry weight fixed by bioimpedance data and in another group the dry weight will by a clinical protocol.

 We will take a 24h ABPM basal from all patients before the randomization.

 Then, 2 weeks later the dry weight be revised, a second ABPM will be taken.

 The results will be compared.

 How to Get a Better Dry Weight in End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Population for Improving Blood Pressure Control@highlight

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a common clinical condition.

 In this population, the prevalence of systemic hypertension is high and its adequate control can determinate the outcome.

 The first step for a good control of blood pressure in renal patients is adjusting his/her dry weight.

 Actually, dry weight is assessed based on clinical examination and blood pressure.

 The electrical bioimpedance is a simple and portable device.

 The investigators design a randomized clinical trial for evaluating two ways of getting the best dry weight for hemodialysis patients.

 A basal 24h ABPM will be taken before the randomization.

 Then, 2 weeks later the dry weight be revised, the investigators will get a second 24h ABPM.
