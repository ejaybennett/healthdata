(fifthQuint)Does Vitamin D Improves Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) in Genotype 2,3 Chronic Hepatitis C Patients?.

 Standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is (Peg/RBV) combination therapy obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of naive patients with genotype 2,3.

 Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors.

 The current study examines whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, could improve viral respons.

The working hypothesis is that Adding vitamin D to conventional Peg/RBV therapy for naive, genotype 2,3 patients with chronic HCV infection significantly improves RVR, EVR, and SVR.

 Does Vitamin D Improves Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) in Genotype 2,3 Chronic Hepatitis C Patients?@highlight

Standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is (Peg/RBV) combination therapy obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of naive patients with genotype 2,3.

 Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors.

 The current study examines 1.

 whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, could improve viral response and shorten treatment duration (from 24 weeks to 12 weeks) 2.

 whether Vitamin D levels predictes negative treatment outcome.
