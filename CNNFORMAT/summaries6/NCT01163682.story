(secondQuint)Acupuncture Study for the Prevention of Taxane Induced Myalgias and Neuropathy.

 The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the difference in neuropathic pain as measured by the mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) worse pain score at 12 weeks between the two arms.

 The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form is a well validated clinical tool used frequently to assess severity of pain and its effect on daily functions.

 BPI-SF also monitors the effects of treatment on pain in patients with cancer and other chronic illnesses.

 The instrument gives several ratings of the intensity and severity of pain and the degree of pain interference on activity, mood, sleep, relations with others and work.

 The questionnaire uses a 0-10 scale for subject ratings and takes five minutes to complete.

 We consider a reduction of 2 or more points on the BPI-SF worst pain item to correspond with a clinically meaningful decrease in pain.

 The secondary endpoints include other efficacy outcomes such as quality of life measures, extent of neurological dysfunction, blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and adverse events.
