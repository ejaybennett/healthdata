(thirdQuint)Biomarkers in Bone Marrow and Blood Samples From Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treated With Cytarabine-Based Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To validate a pre-specified proteomic classifier to predict the likelihood of complete response (CR) to cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy in older patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia.

 Secondary - To identify signaling nodes associated with risk of relapse among these patients who achieve a CR to induction chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Previously collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are analyzed to validate the association of a pre-specified proteomic signature with clinical response via flow cytometry.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in bone marrow and blood samples from older patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with cytarabine-based therapy.
