Rituximab (R) plus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) combination is considered as the new gold standard for the first-line treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

 The study is aimed to evaluate the overall response rate and the safety of four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by rituximab augmentation (weekly four times infusion) in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with aged more than 70 years.
