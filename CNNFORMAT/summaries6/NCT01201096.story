(secondQuint)Neo-adjuvant Peptide Receptor Mediated Radiotherapy With 177Lutetium in Front of Curative Intended Liver Transplantation in Patients With Hepatic Metastasis of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NEO-LEBE).

 Matching patient will be treated neo-adjuvant at the hospital with 177 Lutetium peptide receptor radiotherapy in two following courses.

 After this treatment it will follow the liver transplantation within 9 month as postmortal or living donor liver transplantation.

 Under certain conditions concerning the evaluation examinations patients can be included in the study.

 Most important factors are no evidence of disease outside the liver, removed primary tumor, patients between 18 and 60 years, no curative surgical resection of the liver metastasis possible.
