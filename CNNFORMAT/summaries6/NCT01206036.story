(secondQuint)CESAR Study in Prostate Cancer With Temsirolimus Added to Standard Docetaxel Therapy (CEPTAS).

 The purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate feasibility of dose levels DL1, DL2 and DL3 (which are combinations of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel) and defining a recommended dose (RD) for the Phase II part using these dose levels in a dose escalating scheme.

 Secondary objectives are the collection of safety data on the dose levels used in this part.

In this Phase I study safety of the combination of Docetaxel and Temsirolimus needs to be shown before the study can be expanded into a Phase II study to examine the activity of a safe combination of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel in a comparison with Docetaxel alone.
