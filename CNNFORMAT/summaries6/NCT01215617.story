(thirdQuint)The Effect of Aerobic Interval Training on Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive obstruction and collapse of the upper airway resulting in successive episodes of cessation of or decreased respiratory airflow, causing oxygen desaturation, awakening, loud snoring and daytime sleepiness in patients.

 Sleep apnea is frequently associated with co-morbidity such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

 Lack of exercise is associated with OSAS severity, independent of body mass.

 Participation and motivation to exercise is low in OSAS patients, with less that one third of the patients reporting regular exercise routines.

 We aim to investigate if aerobic interval training improves OSAS in obese subjects.

 The Effect of Aerobic Interval Training on Obstructive Sleep Apnea@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate if 3 months of interval training improves obstructive sleep apnea in obese patients diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.

 The working hypothesis is that 3 months of 3 weekly aerobic interval training sessions improve obstructive sleep apnea and sleep quality in obese patients.
