(fifthQuint)Usage, Usability & Effect on Adherence and Clinical Outcomes of Text Message Reminders for Adolescents With Asthma.

 Adolescents are typically less adept at managing chronic illnesses and adhering to treatment plans than are parents of younger children.

 Adolescents are also typically "early adopters" to technological solutions and text messages are integral in today's teen culture.

 Text messages are gaining acceptance in health care both as appointment reminders and direct inquiries.

 The purpose of this randomized crossover study is to examine the effect of participant designed medication reminders on asthma control, asthma related quality of life, and medication adherence.

 In addition, this study will provide data regarding the usage, usability, and acceptability of an online system designed for creating text message reminders.

 Usage, Usability & Effect on Adherence and Clinical Outcomes of Text Message Reminders for Adolescents With Asthma@highlight

The purpose of this randomized crossover study is to determine the efficacy of participant designed medication reminders on asthma control, asthma related quality of life,and medication adherence.

 In addition, this study will provide data regarding the usage, usability, acceptability of an online system designed for creating text message reminders.

 It is hypothesized that the teens receiving text message reminders will report having greater quality of life related to their asthma, a reported increase in the control of their asthma, and increased adherence to their medication regimen compared to those teens that are not receiving the text message reminders.
