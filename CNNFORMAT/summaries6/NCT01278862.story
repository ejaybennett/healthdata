(secondQuint)Clinical Evaluation of Lava Digital Veneer System (DVS) Crowns.

 Veneers will be randomly allocated to study crowns.

 Study crowns will be evaluated over three years.

 The test porcelain veneer is CAD/CAM milled as a veneer shell that is then fused to the CAD/CAM milled Lava crown to make the final crown to be cemented in the patient's mouth.

 This may be a more predictable technique in the fabrication of Lava crowns than current conventional methods.

 Clinical Evaluation of Lava Digital Veneer System (DVS) Crowns@highlight

Study aim is to compare Lava Computer Aided Design / Computer Aided Milling Computer Aided Machining (CAD/CAM)crowns that are veneered (covered) with porcelain that has been milled using CAD/CAM, with similar CAD/CAM Lava crowns that have been veneered with a hand fabricated porcelain covering.
