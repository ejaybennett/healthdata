(thirdQuint)On Versus Off Pump Myocardial Revascularization Study.

 The initial application of off-pump coronary artery bypass in the early nineties was mainly directed to highly selected and relatively low risk surgical patients.

 Since then there has been a growing body of evidence suggesting many potential advantages of the OPCAB technique over the conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technique in different groups of high-risk patients.

 On-off study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, parallel, trial.

Patients indicated for elective or urgent isolated coronary artery bypass graft with additive European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation 6 were enrolled.

 Patients in cardiogenic shock were excluded.

 Patients were randomly assigned either to coronary artery bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (ON arm) or to off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OFF arm).

 The composite primary end point included operative mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, re-operation for bleeding and adult respiratory distress syndrome, within 30 days after surgery.

 The total planned sample size was 693 patients; the actual number of enrolled patients was 411,according to the results of the interim analysis scheduled at 400 enrollments (alfa-spending=0.

029, Pocock method).

Compare completeness and modality of revascularization, operative and postoperative results and 1 year clinical outcomes in unselected high risk patients referred for primary coronary artery bypass surgery.

 Patients will be randomized to undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB) or coronary artery bypass graft with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB/CAB).
