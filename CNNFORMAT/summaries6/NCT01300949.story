(secondQuint)Spaeth/Richman Contrast Sensitivity Test.

 Objective: To test a new method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require visual acuity and tests various areas of the visual field.

 Hypothesis: A method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require letter recognition (as in the Pelli-Robson test) eliminates the confounders of literacy and pattern recognition, and will permit a more valid determination of contrast sensitivity.

 Patients will perform SPARCS and Pelli-Robson twice; once each with two separate observers for reproducibility and intra-observer reliability.

 The order of testing will be randomized to SPARCS, Pelli, Pelli, SPARCS or Pelli, SPARCS, SPARCS, Pelli.

 Spaeth/Richman Contrast Sensitivity Test@highlight

The Spaeth-Richman Contrast Sensitivity (SPARCS) test is a new method of assessing contrast sensitivity.

 The test is performed on any standard computer with internet access.

 Patients will be tested with SPARCS and with the standard Pelli-Robson contrast test.
