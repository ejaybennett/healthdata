(secondQuint)Detection of Choroidal Nevus Cells in Vitrectomy Fluid.

 Approximately 7% of the population has a choroidal nevus, or "freckle," in the back of the eye.

 Like a nevus on the skin, there is potential for malignant change to a melanoma.

 Dermatologists have the ability to quickly and easily biopsy suspicious skin lesions while ophthalmologists currently have no way of determining the malignant potential of choroidal nevi other than a fine needle aspiration (which is invasive and has the potential complications of bleeding and retinal detachment).

 This study's sole aim is to see if choroidal nevi cells are present in the inside fluid of the eye.

 The investigators plan to analyze the fluid of the eye, which is routinely removed during retina surgery, to detect any nevus cells.

 If the investigators are able to detect these cells, then future studies may allow us to better classify choroidal nevi for potential malignant change.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigators can detect the presence of choroidal nevi cells in the vitreous fluid of humans, as this may improve the diagnosis and classification of choroidal nevi and melanomas in the future.
