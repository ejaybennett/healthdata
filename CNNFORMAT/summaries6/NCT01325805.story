(fifthQuint)Efficacy of a Structured Weight Loss Program in Overweight Women With a History of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a structured weight loss program versus traditional weight-loss counseling on pregnancy outcomes in women with recurrent pregnancy loss.

 The study protocol is as follows: 1.

 Patients will be notified of study via flyer inserted into patient chart at initial clinic visit, physician referral or Stanford website.

 Patients expressing interest will have their charts reviewed to confirm that they meet all enrollment criteria.

 Potential subjects will then be contacted via phone and verbal consent to participate obtained.

 2.

 The participant will then have an office visit for consent signing and randomization.

 A formal weight will be obtained, the Beck Depression Inventory will be administered by Penny Donnelly, a self-administered questionnaire will be completed, and a basic laboratory evaluation, including a fasting lipid panel, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting glucose and insulin levels, 2-hour glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c and CRP will be preformed.

 3.

 The patients will then be randomized to traditional weight loss counseling (control group) or to the structured weight loss program (study group).

 Patients will be instructed to discontinue attempts at conception.

 4.

 Those patients randomized to the control group will receive the ACOG Patient Education pamphlets on obesity.

 5.

 Those patients randomized to the study group will have a formal evaluation and counseling by Dr.

 Sun Kim, a medical endocrinologist specializing in weight management.

 They will then be enrolled in a structured weight loss program.

 6.

 For all patients, a 3-month follow-up office visit will be scheduled.

 At this visit, a formal weight will be obtained, the Beck Depression Inventory will be re-administered by Penny Donnelly, a self-administered questionnaire will be completed, and a follow-up laboratory evaluation, including a fasting lipid panel, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting glucose and insulin levels, 2-hour glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c and CRP will be preformed.

 Patients will be informed that they may now being attempts to conceive.

 7.

 Patients randomized to the study group will continue in the structured weight loss program for 6 months.

 8.

 Six months after enrollment, all patients will have a telephone interview in which a close-out questionnaire will be administered and a final, self-reported weight will be obtained.

 9.

 Primary and secondary outcomes will be followed for 2.

5 years after date of enrollment for all patients.

 Efficacy of a Structured Weight Loss Program in Overweight Women With a History of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss@highlight

Overweight and obesity has been associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women of reproductive age, including infertility and early pregnancy loss.

 Recent data suggests that overweight and obese patients are also at increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), a devastating condition that affects 1% of the fertile population.

 The investigators propose a prospective, randomized controlled trial in which overweight and obese patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss are enrolled in a structured, 6 month, weight loss program or provided routine counseling regarding the importance of weight loss.

 Pregnancy outcomes will then be followed to assess miscarriage rates.

 Metabolic outcomes, such as lipid and glucose profiles, will also be evaluated.
