(thirdQuint)A Parent-Based Intervention to Reduce Sexual Risk Behavior in Adolescents.

 In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from preventable diseases and conditions.

 Many of these problems result from health-related behaviors that are established during childhood and adolescence.

 Latino and African-American adolescents are at considerable risk for the negative consequences of early, risky sexual activity.

 This study will focus on inner-city Latino and African-American early adolescents ages 11 to 14.

 The primary aim will be to test and refine an intervention developed for parents to address the issue of sexual risk behavior with their children.

 The intervention will take place in a primary health care clinic when mothers accompany their children for annual physical exams.

 Mothers will meet with a social work interventionist for approximately 30 minutes while their children are being examined by a physician.

 During this time, mothers will receive information about the problem of premature adolescent sexual activity, support in preventing or reducing their children's sexual risk behavior, instruction about how to talk with their children about sexual risk behavior, and targeted homework activities.

 All parents will also receive three follow-up phone calls to increase the probability that the homework tasks will be completed.

 Participants in this study will also be assigned to one of the following three groups: an experimental group; an active control group; or a passive control group.

 Participants in all groups will complete three questionnaires over the course of the study to assess outcomes.

 Participants in the experimental and active control groups will partake in an additional meeting with a social work interventionist.

 Parents in the experimental group will meet with the social work interventionist to discuss effective parent-adolescent communication strategies.

 They will also receive take-home materials to help them communicate with and parent their adolescents to reduce sexual risk behavior.

 Parents in the active control group will meet with the social work interventionist to discuss adolescent nutrition and receive informational brochures.

 Three booster sessions will take place via telephone for parents in the experimental and active control groups.

 The first booster call will occur approximately 1 month after study entry, the second will occur 5 months after the intervention ends, and the third will occur 9 months post intervention.

 No such booster calls will be provided to parents in the passive control condition.
