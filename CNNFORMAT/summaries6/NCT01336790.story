(secondQuint)International Lymphatic Disease and Lymphedema Registry.

 This project represents the inauguration of a National Patient Registry for Lymphatic Diseases.

 This project will be completed through an affiliation with the Lymphatic Research Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote research and the development of new therapies for patients with lymphatic diseases, including lymphedema.

 The registry will provide researchers with much-needed clinical data to study the impact of diseases of the lymphatic system, in order to develop improved treatments and find a cure for lymphatic diseases, lymphedema, and related disorders.

 The establishment of this initiative is a major step forward in research for direct study of groups of patients with lymphatic disease.

 In the future, this project will be able to be linked with a tissue bank, in which tissue and blood samples derived from patients will be made available for research into human disease states.

 A national patient registry and tissue/cell bank program paves the way for future clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies designed to treat lymphatic disease in human subjects.
