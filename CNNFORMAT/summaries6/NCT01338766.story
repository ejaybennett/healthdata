(secondQuint)Spondylolisthesis Treated With an iO-Flex System Enabled Decompression.

 This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (up to 30 sites) controlled clinical study enrolling 100 subjects following a pre-specified protocol with no site enrolling more than 30 subjects.

 All eligible subjects providing written informed consent and meeting study eligibility criteria will receive a facet preserving decompression using the FDA cleared iO-Flex(R) system on label.

 Treatment success using the iO-Flex(R) System will be analyzed using a precision estimate assuming a 55% positive response rate.

 In addition to baseline characteristics and procedural parameters, subject outcomes will be assessed at 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24 months.

 The study will have an extended follow-up phase with annual follow-up contact through 5 years to evaluate retreatment for the original indication at these late time points.
