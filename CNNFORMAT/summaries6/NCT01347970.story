(thirdQuint)Pharmacologic Reversal of Ventricular Remodeling in Childhood Cancer Survivors at Risk for Congestive Heart Failure (PREVENT-CHF): A Phase IIB Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose carvedilol on surrogate echocardiographic indices of CHF risk, including: left ventricular (LV) posterior wall thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D); LV systolic and diastolic function, and afterload; natriuretic peptides, troponins, and galactin-3.

 II.

 To establish safety and tolerability of this two-year course of low-dose carvedilol, assessing both objective measures (hepatic function) and patients reported outcomes.

 III.

 To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year carvedilol intervention.

 IV.

 As an exploratory goal, to examine the relationship between carvedilol and clinical measures of efficacy such as prevention of CHF.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the long-term efficacy of carvedilol in preventing cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure in high-risk childhood cancer survivors.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally (PO) once (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 24 months.

 ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD or BID for 24 months.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

 Pharmacologic Reversal of Ventricular Remodeling in Childhood Cancer Survivors at Risk for Congestive Heart Failure (PREVENT-CHF): A Phase IIB Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well low-dose carvedilol works in preventing congestive heart failure (CHF) in younger cancer survivors exposed to high dose anthracyclines for management of childhood cancer.

 Carvedilol may help lower the risk of cardiovascular complications
