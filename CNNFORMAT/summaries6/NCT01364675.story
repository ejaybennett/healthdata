(thirdQuint)Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Pre-diabetic & Pre-hypertensive Subjects.

 The risks of CVD are not confined to a subset of established "hypertensive" or "diabetic" population, but also increase among those with suboptimal blood pressure and glycemic level, namely "pre-hypertensive" or "pre-diabetic" population.

 Evidence on the effectiveness of drug interventions to lower CVD events in pre-clinical stage population has been scant.

 Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Pre-diabetic & Pre-hypertensive Subjects@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether treating pre-diabetic & pre-hypertensive individuals using multiple drugs intervention (anti-hypertensive drugs (i.

e.

, ACEI) plus anti-glycemic drug (i.

e.

, metformin) plus anti-hyperlipidemic drug (statin)) would lower Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) events.
