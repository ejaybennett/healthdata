(secondQuint)PET/CT in Diagnosing Patients With Liver Cancer Undergoing Surgical Resection.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the most optimal 18F-fluoromethylcholine (FCH) PET/CT parameters for detecting primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by conducting a clinical radiologic-pathologic correlation study to estimate and compare the receiver operating characteristics of kinetic and static PET measures of tumor FCH metabolism in patients that test positive during screening or conventional imaging.

 II.

 Identify cancer signaling pathways associated with choline metabolism in HCC by profiling the global gene expression patterns in fresh-frozen liver tissue samples that are correlated with the features derived from FCH PET/CT images.

 III.

 Characterize the association between features derived from FCH PET/CT images of the liver and clinical liver disease severity and comparatively evaluate the ability of corresponding gene expression signatures to predictively model HCC disease outcome.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT within 14 days of surgical resection.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 PET/CT in Diagnosing Patients With Liver Cancer Undergoing Surgical Resection@highlight

This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing patients with liver cancer undergoing surgical resection.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, may help find and diagnose liver cancer.
