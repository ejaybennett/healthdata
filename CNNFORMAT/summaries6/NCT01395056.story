(secondQuint)Study of Chemotherapy With Adoptive Cellular Therapy With DC-CIK Cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients.

 1.

 Metastatic breast cancer patients should be definitively diagnosis based on histopathology, with ER-negative and PR-negative, FISH testing for her-2-negative 2.

 All the patients enrolled will be given standard cyclophosphamide combined thiotepa and carboplatin chemotherapy and cellular therapy.

Cellular therapy consisting of one cycle of chemotherapy followed by an apheresis and ex vivo cultures to generate DC and CIK, followed by low-dose Oral Cyclophosphamide .

 3.

 The response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines.

 4.

 Estimate time to progression, survival rates and clinical benefit response on patients.

 5.

 Find biomarkers associated with drug response.
