(fifthQuint)Early Clinical Results of Mobile-Bearing Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Failure modes of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that include prosthetic loosening and damage to constraining mechanisms often require revision TKA.

 Mobile bearing revision TKA components have been developed in hopes of lessening these failure mechanisms.

 Our purpose is to evaluate the use of mobile bearings in revision TKA.

 Retrospective clinical and radiographic evaluation of 340 revision mobile bearing TKAs using the PFC Sigma and LCS posterior stabilized rotating platform implants (Depuy, Warsaw, IN) will be performed.

 Indications for revision include instability, loosening, arthrofibrosis, chronic hemarthrosis, failed patellofemoral replacement, failed unicompartmental knee replacement, infection reimplantation, and supracondylar fracture nonunion.

 Early Clinical Results of Mobile-Bearing Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty@highlight

Long term follow-up is needed to determine whether current Mobile Bearing revision Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) designs will improve implant longevity.

 The potential advantages of mobile bearings in the revision TKA setting include reduction in polyethylene wear, decreasing fixation stresses, and protection of the constraining mechanisms.

 Several studies have reported satisfactory clinical results after revision total knee arthroplasty but no study with a large number has specifically addressed the clinical outcomes after revision total knee arthroplasty using the mobile bearing design
