(fifthQuint)Nursing Home Pain Management Algorithm Clinical Trial.

 Inadequate pain management in nursing homes (NHs) is well documented.

 Unrelieved pain in this setting results in depression, decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical and social functioning.

 This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a pain management algorithm delivered using intense diffusion strategies.

 Outcomes are facility pain practices and residents' pain, physical function and depression.

 Specific aims of the study are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a pain management algorithm (ALG) coupled with intense diffusion strategies, as compared with pain education (EDU) and weak diffusion strategies, in improving pain, mobility, and depression among NH residents; 2) Determine the extent to which adherence to the ALG and organizational factors are associated with changes in resident outcomes and the extent to which changes in these variables are associated with changes in outcomes; 3) Evaluate the persistence of changes in process and outcome variables at long-term follow-up and 4) Evaluate the relationships among behavioral problems and pain in severely cognitively impaired residents who are unable to provide self-report.

Pain assessment and management deficiencies in nursing homes (NHs) are well documented.

 Unrelieved pain in this setting results in poorer resident outcomes, including depression, decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical and social functioning.
