(secondQuint)Pancreatic Enzyme Suppletion in Pancreatic Cancer.

 Weight loss in cancer is caused by primary tumour effects and secondary effects (e.

g.

 side effects of treatment, mechanical and intestinal obstruction).

 In pancreatic cancer, additional weight loss and malnutrition may be due to the development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).

 The presence of EPI in pancreatic cancer is frequently overlooked, because the focus of treatment is directed at possible surgery or chemotherapy and its potential side effects.

 Although studies have proven that pancreatic enzymes may prevent or decrease weight loss, they are seldom being prescribed.

 Pancreatic Enzyme Suppletion in Pancreatic Cancer@highlight

This study will evaluate the effect of immediate pancreatic enzyme suppletion on the physical and mental health status and survival of patients who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and are highly likely to develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency during their disease process.
