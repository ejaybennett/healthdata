(fifthQuint)Risperidone and Desipramine in Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia.

 Alcohol use disorder is at least three times more common in schizophrenia than in the general population, and worsens the course of schizophrenia.

 Typical antipsychotic agents are of limited value in controlling alcohol use in these "dual diagnosis" patients.

 Data from our group and others suggest that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine limits alcohol and cannabis use in "dual diagnosis" patients with schizophrenia much more effectively than other antipsychotics that have been assessed, however, the side effects produced by clozapine severely limit its use.

 The investigators have hypothesized that clozapine will lessen alcohol/substance use in such dual diagnosis patients in part because of its mechanism of action that includes release of dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex which will help to normalize dysfunctional brain reward circuits that may underlie the co- occurring alcohol/substance use in patients with schizophrenia.

 Our data suggest that the effect of clozapine can be duplicated in rodents when medications with clozapine-like activity (DA D2 antagonism, potent norepinephrine (NE) 2 receptor antagonism and NE reuptake inhibition) are combined together.

 The investigators have demonstrated that RISP (a medication that is both a DA D2 receptor antagonist, and a potent NE 2 receptor antagonist), in combination with the specific NE reuptake inhibitor desipramine, significantly decreases alcohol consumption in alcohol drinking rodents.

 This translational study is a pilot "proof of concept" 14-week double-blind investigation of participants who have co-occurring diagnoses of schizophrenia and an alcohol use disorder.

 Patients not treated with risperidone (or a risperidone-like agent, including risperidone long-acting, paliperidone and paliperidone palmitate) at the time of consent will be switched to oral risperidone in the first two weeks of the study.

 At Week 3, all participants will begin treatment with risperidone risperidone plus desipramine and followed for 12 weeks.

 The primary outcome measure will be days of drinking (per week), as well as days of heavy drinking (per week).

 The investigators anticipate that data from this study will support a larger trial of risperidone + desipramine in patients with schizophrenia and an alcohol use disorder.

 Risperidone and Desipramine in Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia@highlight

Note: In June 2013, the study design was changed from a randomized controlled study of risperidone + despiramine vs.

 risperidone vs.

 placebo to an open label pre-post study of risperidone (or risperidone-like drug) + desipramine.

 The aims of the study were revised to read: 1.

 To determine whether participants treated with risperidone in combination with desiprmaine have less alcohol use (fewer drinking days; fewer heavy drinking days) during the final 8 weeks on these medications as compared to pre-baseline.

 The primary hypothesis is that compared to pre-baseline, participants will demonstrate fewer days of drinking (per week), as well as fewer days of heavy drinking (per week) in the final eight weeks they are taking risperidone and desipramine, as recorded on the Timeline Follow-Back assessment 2.

 To explore changes in symptoms (of schizophrenia and of depression) in the final eight weeks of treatment with risperidone + desipramine compared to the period before baseline 3.

 To assess the side effect burden associated with the combination of these two medications in participants.

 The original aims of the study were: The purpose of this study is to determine whether participants who are treated with risperidone in combination with desipramine have less alcohol use (fewer drinking days; fewer heavy drinking days) than do participants who are treated with RISP with placebo.

 The primary hypothesis is that compared to treatment with risperidone, participants randomized to a combination of risperidone plus desipramine will have fewer days of drinking, as well as fewer days of heavy drinking.

 The study will also compare the effects of risperidone as compared to risperidone plus desipramine on participants' symptoms and side effects.
