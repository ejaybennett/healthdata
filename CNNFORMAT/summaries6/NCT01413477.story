(fifthQuint)Nickel Desensitization Using Topical Therapy.

 1.

 Purpose: To evaluate whether topical anti-inflammatory ointments (calcipotriol, betamethasone dipropionate, or a combination of both) can decrease sensitivity to nickel in known nickel allergic patients.

 Optional blood samples will be part of the protocol to measure immune responses.

 2.

 Hypothesis: Use of these topical agents will prevent sensitization to nickel sulfate upon re-exposure.

 3.

 Justification: Currently, no cure can yet be offered to nickel sensitive patients.

 Standard treatment only involves avoiding nickel-containing products.

 However, this is not always easily achieved depending on patient awareness and environmental exposures.

 Topical desensitization has not yet been explored in patients with pre-established contact allergy.

 This research will be placebo-controlled with Vaseline petroleum jelly to compare reactions to nickel in those treated with anti-inflammatory ointments.

 4.

 Objectives: a) To evaluate the use of topical anti-inflammatory agents and its role in desensitizing known nickel allergic patients to nickel.

 b) To measure immune cell responses to nickel allergen from a blood sample taken before and after topical anti-inflammatory application.

 5.

 Research Method: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, proof of principle study.

 Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria with known nickel sensitivity will be recruited into the study.

 Those who consent will undergo 3 sets of nickel patch testing: At week 1 to confirm nickel allergic status, week 3 to induce tolerance by patch testing at the site of topical ointment application, and finally at week 5 to test for desensitization.

 (Week 2 is self-application with topical ointment; Week 4 is a rest week).

 6.

 Statistical Analysis: a) Primary end-point: Clinical responses measured by standard patch testing scores will be documented and photographed for comparison.

 b) Secondary end-point: Levels of T regulatory cell responses before and after topical treatment.

 c) Planned sample size: 24 patients.

 Given that this is a proof-of-principle study, the investigators are choosing to study a small sample size to detect any differences amongst treatment arms, if any.

 A larger-scale, adequately-powered study would be needed to detect any statistical significance.

 Nickel Desensitization Using Topical Therapy@highlight

Nickel contact dermatitis (eczema) is one of the most common allergic conditions affecting the skin.

 This is a study looking at potentially desensitizing nickel-allergic patients to their allergy using anti-inflammatory ointments applied to the skin (arm).

 Application of these ointments (ie.

 modified Vitamin D) has been shown to increase specific immune cells (T regulatory cells), which play a role in preventing immune activation and subsequently inflammation.

 The investigators propose use of topical anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, modified Vitamin D, or both) may desensitize patients with nickel allergy.
