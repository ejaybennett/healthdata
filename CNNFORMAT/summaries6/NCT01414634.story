(thirdQuint)Establish Tolerance In MS With Peptide-Coupled, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.

 Open-label, single center, phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy and in vivo mechanisms of action of a single infusion of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells chemically coupled with seven myelin peptides (MOG1-20, MOG35-55, MBP13-32, MBP83-99, MBP111-129, MBP146-170, and PLP139-154) in Multiple Sclerosis patients who were off-treatment for standard therapies.

 Neurological, magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory, and immunological examinations were performed to assess the safety, tolerability, and in vivo mechanisms of action of this regimen.
