 This is a Phase Ib/2 study of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus.

 The Phase 1b portion is to test the safety and tolerability of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus and determine the highest dose of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) and everolimus that can safely be given in combination.

 The Phase 2 portion of this study will continue the evaluation of safety of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus and compare the effect of the study drugs on tumor response and life expectancy in patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC.
