(thirdQuint)Study to Assess the Effect of Adjuvant and Route of Administration on the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of NDV-3 Vaccine Against S.

Aureus and Candida.

 Preclinical studies in mice have established that several members of the Als family of proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S.

 aureus.

 Als3 (the antigen in the NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S.

 aureus.

 The first Phase 1 study enrolled 40 healthy subjects that received placebo (N=10), 1 dose (N=30) or 2 doses(N=19)of the NDV-3 vaccine administered IM.

 The vaccine was well tolerated and highly immunogenic.

 This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of one dose of NDV-3 vaccine formulated with and without alum given IM and also a lower dose without alum given ID.

 Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the safety tolerability and immune responses at selected time points up to 90 days post-vaccination.

Aureus and Candida@highlight

This partially-blind, placebo controlled study is a Phase 1b study using an investigational vaccine, NDV-3, directed against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida sp.

 This study will compare NDV-3 administered with or without alum delivered intramuscularly (IM) at one dose level.

 It will also evaluate a lower dose of NDV-3 without alum delivered intradermally (ID) compared to placebo delivered ID.
