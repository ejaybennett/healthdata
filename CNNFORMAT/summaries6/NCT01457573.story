 Single center, pilot trial, single arm study using once daily dosing of tamsulosin and solifenacin in 10 men with symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

 Assessments occur at Baseline, 1 Month, 2 Month and 3 Month to evaluate: urinary NGF (pg/mL), urine creatinine (mg/dL), NGF/Cr ratio and patient reported questionnaire outcomes (AUA Symptom Score/IPSS, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Patient Perception of Urge Intensity 'PPIUS', LUTS Urinary Symptoms and Quality of Life).
