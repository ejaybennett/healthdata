(secondQuint)To Compare Blood and Urine Concentrations of Mirabegron (YM178) in Healthy Poor or Extensive Metabolizers for CYP2D6 and to Assess the Effect of Mirabegron on the Metabolism of Metoprolol.

 The study is an open label, single center study.

 All subjects are genotyped for CYP2D6 before the study.

 Genotype expression is confirmed by dextromethorphan phenotyping.

 Part I: The pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of YM178 is compared in 8 healthy male subjects genotyped and phenotyped as poor metaboliser (PM) for CYP2D6 and in 8 healthy male subjects genotyped and phenotyped as extensive metaboliser (EM) for CYP2D6.

 Part II: The effect of YM178 on the model substrate of CYP2D6 metoprolol is evaluated, using a cross-over design, in 12 healthy male subjects genotyped and phenotyped as EM for CYP2D6.

The study aims to compare blood and urine concentrations of mirabegron (YM178) in healthy poor or extensive metabolizers for CYP2D6 and to evaluate if blood levels of metoprolol change whilst being dosed at the same time with daily miragebron.
