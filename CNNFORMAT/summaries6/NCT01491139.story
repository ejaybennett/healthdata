(thirdQuint)Phase I Study of Olaparib With Cisplatin Based Chemoradiotherapy in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.

 This is a dose escalating Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of the addition of olaparib to CRT in high risk locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV) negative Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (HNSCC).

 A fixed dose of weekly cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be used, with doses of olaparib escalating for consecutive days and both dose level and duration will be increased through each cohort.

 This Phase I trial will assess how olaparib, a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is tolerated when added to standard chemoradiotherapy treatment.

 Patients will be recruited from sites in the UK only.

 A placebo controlled, randomised Phase II trial will follow once the recommended dose and schedule of olaparib has been established.
