(thirdQuint)S9031-9333-0106-0112-A Study of Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treated With Standard Chemotherapy With or Without Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether measuring biomarkers in less-differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts significantly improves their predictive accuracy to predict clinical outcomes for patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy with and without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

 - To develop and validate novel predictive biomarker models for predicting clinical outcomes for AML patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy with and without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

 OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from archived bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are analyzed for genomic mutations (CEBPA, FLT3, IDH1/2, KIT, NPM1, RUNX1, TP53, and WT1) and transcriptional biomarkers (BAALC, CCNA1, CD34, CEBPA, ERG, EVI1, FLT3, IL3RA, MCL1 [two splice variants], MN1, RUNX1, and WT1) by PCR and real-time PCR.

 Data are then analyzed by the Gene Scan software.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with standard chemotherapy with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
