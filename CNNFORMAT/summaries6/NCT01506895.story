(secondQuint)A Phase 2 Clinical Study to Investigate Effects of Darapladib in Subjects With Diabetic Macular Edema.

 This is a multi-national, multi-centre, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of repeat oral administration of 160 mg darapladib for 3 months in adult subjects with DME with centre involvement.

 Eligible subjects will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio of active treatment to placebo, with the placebo group to allow a comparison of safety between treatment arms and to minimize the open label effect that can be observed with the visual acuity endpoint.

 The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of repeat doses of darapladib on the mean change from baseline of both best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) centre subfield.

 The study eye will be examined for changes over the life of the study.

 As this investigational treatment is systemic, the fellow eye may be examined in tandem to provide additional data.
