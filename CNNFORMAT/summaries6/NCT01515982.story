(fifthQuint)Physical Exercise as an Additional Treatment for Alzheimer Disease.

 - Design: Four-month controlled, randomized, and double-blind study.

 The patients will be recruited by trained psychiatrists from the Center for Alzheimer's disease in the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ).

 They will be randomized with a blind design to an exercise group (EG) and control group (CG) by a researcher who will not participate of the initial assessments.

 - Intervention On completion of the baseline assessment, all patients will be invited to engage in the exercise program.

 Those who accept to take part and will be available, having easy access to the facilities, will be included in the sample.

 The other ones will be included in the control group.

 So, subjects will be divided by two groups: medical care (control) and medical care + physical exercise.

 1.

 Medical care control group (C): Subjects will maintain clinical treatment.

 2.

 Medical care + exercise group (E): This group will be prescribed the exercise treatment as an adjunctive intervention to drug therapy.

 Patients who accept to participate in this group will be evaluated with a thorough clinical exam and with a resting electrocardiogram.

 The training exercise intensity is established at 60% of VO2max.

 This intensity was determined using exercise prescription guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).

 Each aerobic session began with a 10-minute warm-up period (40%VO2max), followed by 20 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at an intensity established by 60% of VO2max, according to ACMS guidelines (2006).

 The exercise session will be concluded with a five minutes of cool down.

 Heart hate (Polar(R) Sport Tester, Finland) and perceived exertion (Borg Scale) will be monitored and recorded at each five minutes during each exercise session by physical education instructors.

 Subjects will be encouraged to attend two supervised exercise sessions per week for 16 weeks.

 Physical Exercise as an Additional Treatment for Alzheimer Disease@highlight

The state of the art with regard to the neurodegenerative dementias, especially for Alzheimers disease (AD), is that their progression is still irreversible causing cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairment.

 Although the current pharmacological treatments attenuate cognitive decline in some cases, the majority of treatments does not avoid the motor and functional changes caused by the progress of the disease.

 Although several studies show that exercise has a positive effect when it comes to the treatment of the disease, some methodological questions affect the application of the training protocols.

 The use of recognized intensity patterns like maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum heart rate (HRmax) percentage to control the training of patients with dementia is still rare in the literature.

 Therefore, this seems to interfere on the definition of an ideal prescription.

 Following this line of reasoning, the purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of moderate aerobic exercise on cognition and functional abilities in AD patients.

 Design: Randomized controlled trial, double-blinded, with 16-week follow-up.

 Setting: Center for Alzheimer's disease in the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

 Participants: Elderly with Alzheimer disease.

 Interventions: The patients will be randomly assigned to an exercise group (EG) on a treadmill (30 minutes, twice a week and moderate intensity of 60% VO2max) and a control group (CG).

 Main outcome measures: Cognitive function will be assessed using CAMCOG, Trail Making Test A, Digit Span, Stroop Test, Rey auditory-verbal learning test and Clock Test, and functional capacity will be evaluated using Berg Balance Scale (BERG), Sit-to-Stand test (STS), functional reach test (FR), and the time to up and go test (TUGT).
