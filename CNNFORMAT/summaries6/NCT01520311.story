(thirdQuint)The eSVS Mesh Post-Marketing Trial.

 This Study will enroll up to 100 patients total.

 Patients will be enrolled upon meeting certain inclusion criteria, including GSV duplex-sonography results and consent.

 They will be enrolled based on their clinically indicated requirement for coronary artery bypass grafting with use of their saphenous vein graft.

 The study will be prospective, randomized repeated measure controlled trial based on the patient's ability to receive both control and eSVS Mesh treatment.

 Graft patency, MACCE at 6 and 24 months after meshed and non meshed GSV graft implantation will be measured and the findings and qualification of GSV in preoperative duplex sonography will be compared with intraoperative findings while GSV harvesting in order to evaluate the safety of the eSVS mesh and the role of preoperative GSV duplex sonography.
