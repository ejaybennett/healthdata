(secondQuint)Is it Effective to Treat Patients With Blastocystis Hominis Infection?.

 Prevalence of B.

 hominis is between 30-50% in developing countries.

 Many travellers visit developing countries and are therefore at risk to be infected by this parasite.

 It's frequent that travellers return from developing countries with gastro-intestinal symptoms and approximately 10% of them have B.

 hominis as the sole parasite identified in the stools.

 Some anti-infective drugs, including metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nitazoxanide, have shown to have activity against B.

 hominis, but there is still controversy about the pathogenic potential of B.

 hominis and there is no consensus about the indications for treatment.

 It is hypothesised that metronidazole is more effective than placebo in returning travellers with gastrointestinal symptoms and B.

 hominis as the sole intestinal parasite identified in the stool.
