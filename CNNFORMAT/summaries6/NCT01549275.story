(thirdQuint)Primary Cell Culture of Hepatic Tumorous Cells From Routine Fine-needle Aspiration.

 Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology or biopsy of hepatic tumor is frequently applied in the collection of specimens because it is considered safe, efficacious, accurate and cost effective.

 Our previous study from small number of patients showed that specimens obtained from FNA had potential to be applied for primary culture of cancer cells.

 This study was to modified our method for primary culture of both hepatocellular carcinoma cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in patients with tumor measuring larger than or equal to 3cm.

 All patients received one session of aspiration for the diagnosis of hepatic tumor.

 The aspirated specimens were applied for both cytologic and pathologic examinations at first.

 After then, 10 mL 0.

9% NaCl was aspirated by the same needle connected with the same syringe and injected into 15 mL sterilized centrifugation tube.

 If the tube contained visible specimens, these specimens were sent for primary culture.

The purposes of this prospective study were to evaluate the successful rate of primary culture of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts from the residual specimens in routine fine-needle aspiration of hepatic tumor and the potential application of this method as an additional tool for personalized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
