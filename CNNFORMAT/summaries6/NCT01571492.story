(fifthQuint)Continuous L2 Paravertebral Block Versus Continuous Lumbar Plexus Block for Postoperative Analgesia.

 The nerve stimulator guided technique of continuous lumbar plexus block (LPB) is the accepted standard of care at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of postoperative analgesia after Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 Over 900 continuous lumbar plexus blocks were performed at UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital within the last year alone.

 Continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is also commonly performed at UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside .

 Over 2000 are performed annually for a wide variety of surgical procedures.

 Recently authors have suggested that a lumbar paravertebral block (LPVB) may represent an alternative approach to the lumbar plexus.

 Indeed the L2 paravertebral approach of the lumbar plexus has been described to provide adequate postoperative analgesia following hip arthroscopic surgery.

 However, to date, there is no prospective direct comparison between L2 Lumbar plexus approach and the posterior approach for postoperative analgesia after Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 Continuous L2 Paravertebral Block Versus Continuous Lumbar Plexus Block for Postoperative Analgesia@highlight

This prospective study is intended to compare the analgesic efficacy, preservation of lower extremity motor power and side-effect profile of L2 Paravertebral lumbar plexus approach compared to Posterior nerve stimulation guided lumbar plexus approach, continuous local anesthetic infusion postoperative analgesia of Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 The L2 Paravertebral technique of lumbar plexus block, as part of a multimodal pain treatment, could be a cost-effective alternative with a equal profile of analgesic efficacy and motor power sparing with greater promotion of early achievement of postoperative physical therapy goals.
