(fifthQuint)Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Strategies for the Anterolateral Territory: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial.

 Purpose: This novel surgical design use a composite-sequential venous graft to distribute left anterior mammary artery (LIMA) inflow directly to the left anterior descending coronary (LAD), but also to the other branches of the anterolateral territory thereby promoting a higher flow through the LIMA pedicle.

 It is constructed using a short saphenous vein graft (SVG) bridge (LSVB) interposed between the LAD and one (or more) other anterolateral targets, with the LIMA grafted on the hood of the SVG just above the LAD anastomosis.

 Objectives.

 The main objective of the prospective randomized clinical trial AMI-PONT is to assess whether a CABG strategy including a LSVB to distribute the LIMA outflow provides non-inferior patency rates compared to conventional CABG surgery with separated LIMA graft to LAD and SVG to other anterolateral targets.

 Methods.

 Two hundred adult patients undergoing primary isolated CABG, requiring grafting of LAD and at least one other anterolateral target, will be randomized 1:1 in two treatment arms: 1) CABG strategy with LSVB; and 2) conventional CABG strategy with LIMA graft to the LAD and separate aorto-coronary SVG to other anterolateral targets.

 Patients will be assessed clinically at 30 days, 6 months, one, five and ten years.

 They will undergo graft patency assessment at one and five years using Multi-Slice Computed Tomography.

 All patients will undergo CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

 Patients will be excluded if they have a contraindication to CPB or MSCT graft assessment.

 Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Strategies for the Anterolateral Territory: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial@highlight

The purpose of the AMI-PONT trial is to assess whether the results in term of graft patency with a novel coronary artery bypass (CABG) strategy, including a saphenous vein bridge to distribute the arterial flow of the left anterior mammary artery (LIMA) to all the anterolateral territory, are not inferior than a conventional CABG strategy combining separated LIMA graft to left anterior descending coronary and vein graft for other target vessels of the anterolateral territory.
