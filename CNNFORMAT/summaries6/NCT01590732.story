(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of Romidepsin Plus ICE for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of romidepsin based on when you join this study.

 Up to 4 dose levels of romidepsin will be tested.

 Between 3-10 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

 The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.

 Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin is found.

 All participants will receive the same dose level of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide.

 Study Drug Administration: Each Cycle is 14 days.

 On Day 1: - You will receive romidepsin by vein over 4 hours.

 - You will receive ifosfamide by vein over 24 hours.

 - You will receive mesna by vein over 24 hours.

 This infusion will begin 12 hours after the end of the ifosfamide infusion.

 Mesna is given to help reduce the risk of bladder-related side effects.

 - You will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.

 - You will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.

 On Days 2-3, you will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.

 On Day 4, you will receive romidepsin by vein over 4 hours.

 If needed, you will receive magnesium and potassium replacements.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - You will have an ECG.

 - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

 Every week, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 Between Days 7-14 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you may have a CT and PET/CT to check the status of the disease.

 Length of Study Drug Administration: You may receive up to 6 cycles.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug combination if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.

 End-of-Study Visit: About 14 days after the last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - You may have a CT and PET/CT to check the status of the disease.

 - You may have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have an ECG.

 - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

 This is an investigational study.

 Romidepsin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.

 ICE is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of lymphoma, including relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 The combination of romidepsin and ICE for the treatment of PTCL is investigational.

 Up to 30 participants will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

 Phase I Study of Romidepsin Plus ICE for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is find the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin that can be given in combination with ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE) to patients with PTCL.

 The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

 Romidepsin is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells and block new blood vessels from forming around the cancer cells.

 This may cause the cancer cells to die.

 Ifosfamide and etoposide are designed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.

 Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division, which may cause the cells to die.
