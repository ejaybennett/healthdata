(thirdQuint)The Utility of Cap Colonoscopy in Increasing Adenoma Detection Rate.

 This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing the adenoma detection rate between Hispanic patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with a conventional colonoscope or with a cap-assisted colonoscopy.

 The aims of the study are: 1.

 Compare ADR between Hispanic patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with and without cap.

 2.

 Compare the overall polyp detection rate between Hispanic patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with and without cap.

 3.

 Compare the cecal intubation rate and cecal intubation time between standard colonoscopy and cap assisted colonoscopy.

 4.

 Compare the complication rate between standard colonoscopy and cap assisted colonoscopy.

 The Utility of Cap Colonoscopy in Increasing Adenoma Detection Rate@highlight

This is a research study about the usefulness of transparent cap during screening colonoscopy.

 The purpose of the research is to test the usefulness of adding small cap to the tip of the colonoscope.

 the investigators hypothesis is that Cap assisted colonoscopy will improve the detection of adenomatous polyps (polyps which can become colon cancer later on) in comparison to the standard colonoscopy.
