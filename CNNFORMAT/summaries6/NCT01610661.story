(secondQuint)Dietary Carbohydrate Type and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Indicators.

 The objective of this pilot study is to determine the relative comparability for an isocaloric exchange of (1) refined-carb for simple-carb and (2) refined-carb for unrefined-carb, on established and emerging CVD risk indicators.

 To achieve this goal, subjects with moderate dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol > 100mg/dL) will consume diets enriched in 3 types of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb and unrefined-carb) according to a randomized, cross-over design.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of habituation to diets with different types of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb, unrefined-carb) on selected Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk indicators.
