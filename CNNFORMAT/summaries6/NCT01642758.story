(fifthQuint)Trial of HQK-1001 in Beta Thalassemia Intermedia in Lebanon.

 This is a trial of an experimental oral medicine which stimulates production of fetal hemoglobin, an innate type of hemoglobin which is normally made but is suppressed in infancy.

 Fetal globin (HbF) can perform the function of the missing beta globin and reduce anemia in beta thalassemia, when it is produced in higher amounts than normal.

 In this trial, 10 patients with beta thalassemia intermedia in Lebanon will all receive the study drug for 6 months at a dose which has been previously shown to be safe in normal volunteers and in beta thalassemia and sickle cell patients and to stimulate fetal globin production in many, when given for brief periods.

 The purpose of this trial is the following: 1.

 To determine if total hemoglobin levels increase above baseline in some subjects when the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.

 2.

 To determine if fetal globin is increased above baseline levels in a proportion of subjects when the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.

 3.

 To determine the number of adverse events which occur with 26 weeks of administration of the study drug in beta thalassemia intermedia subjects.

 After a screening period, the subjects will take the study drug at home once a day.

 They will be seen once every 4 weeks for examinations and laboratory tests during the dosing period and for 4 weeks afterwards.

 This trial will provide an important step in evaluating a potential treatment for patients with beta thalassemia intermedia, that can be used around the world, if it is effective and safe.

 Trial of HQK-1001 in Beta Thalassemia Intermedia in Lebanon@highlight

Beta thalassemia intermedia syndromes are genetic anemias caused by mutations which reduce production of beta globin, a major component of adult hemoglobin A, the protein which delivers oxygen throughout the body.

 Patients suffer from poor growth, fatigue, heart failure, endocrine deficiencies, and eventually, many require chronic blood transfusions.

 There is no approved therapeutic for the deficiency of beta globin chains in beta thalassemia.

 This trial will study an oral therapeutic which stimulates production of fetal globin, an alternate type which is produced by all humans, but is normally switched off in infancy.

 This type of globin can compensate for the missing protein in beta thalassemia.
