(fifthQuint)A Phase  Study of Genetically Modified Recombinant Human Interleukin-11.

 The investigators recently developed a mutant form of rhIL-11 with improved stability.

 In in vitro experimental systems, mIL-11 was shown to endure chemical and proteolytic stresses more effectively, while retaining the biological activity of the original rhIL-11.

 The improved stability of mIL-11 was also demonstrated in the comparative pharmacokinetic study of subcutaneously delivered mIL-11 and rhIL-11 in the rodent and primate models.

 Based on its improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features.

 In Phase II study shows that mIL-11 is well tolerated and has thrombopoietic activity equivalent to one third of the clinical dose of rhIL-11, indicating the potential of mIL-11 for use in the treatment of CIT.

 This study is a phase III, single-blinded, randomized,multicenter,cross-over study designed to evaluate optimal dosing dose and efficacy and safety of mIL-11 on CIT patients receiving suitable chemotherapeutic regimen for treating cancer.

This phases III trials is divided into two stages,IIIa and IIIb.

The aim of IIIa is to evaluate the optimal dosing dose of genetically modified recombinant human IL-11 (mIL-11) in a multicenter randomized self-control trial involving 60 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The aim of IIIb is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of genetically modified recombinant human IL-11 (mIL-11), using rhIL-11 as an active control, in a multicenter randomized trial involving 240 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
