(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury.

 The Principal investigator has performed a clinical trial using autologous MSCs in patients with cervical spinal cord injury.

 The results revealed the safety of autologous MSC.

 This Phase II, III single-center trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation direct to injured spinal cord site via laminectomy.

 After recovery from the operation, the subjects receive 4 weeks of physical and occupational therapy.
