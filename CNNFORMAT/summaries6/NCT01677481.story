(firstQuint)Randomized Evaluation of Vascular Entry Site and Radiation Exposure: REVERE Trial.

 Patients referred for coronary angiography will be randomized to either left radial, right radial or femoral arterial access sites, and the coronary angiogram will be performed in a standard fashion, including left ventriculography.

 Radiation exposure parameters including Air Kerma, Dose-area product, Fluoroscopy time and Operator radiation exposure will be recorded.

 Operator experience as well as demographic data will be recorded.
