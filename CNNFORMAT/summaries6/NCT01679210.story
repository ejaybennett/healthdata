(thirdQuint)Study of a Postpartum Diabetes Prevention Program for Hispanic Women.

 Specific aims are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on 1) postpartum weight loss, 2) biomarkers associated with insulin resistance (i.

e.

, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, leptin, TNF-, HOMA, AUCgluc, adiponectin), 3) other cardiovascular risk factors (i.

e.

, blood lipids, blood pressure, CRP, fetuin-A, albumin-to-creatinine ratio), and 4) the adoption and maintenance of postpartum behaviors associated with weight loss and prevention of diabetes risk (i.

e.

, physical activity, diet).

 Eligible Hispanic women will be recruited after routine GDM screening and randomly assigned to a Lifestyle Intervention (n=150) or a Comparison Health and Wellness (control) intervention (n=150).

 The intervention will be based on our efficacious exercise and dietary interventions for Hispanics (R01NR011295; WIC Common Pathways).

 Multimodal contacts (i.

e.

, in-person, telephone counseling, and mailed print-based materials) will be used to deliver the intervention from randomization (29 wks gestation) to 12 months postpartum.

 Targets of the intervention are to achieve Institute of Medicine Guidelines for postpartum weight loss; American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologist guidelines for physical activity; and American Diabetes Association guidelines for diet.

 The intervention draws from Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model and addresses the specific social, cultural, economic, and physical environmental challenges faced by underserved Hispanic women.

 Measures of adherence will include accelerometers and dietary recalls.

 The project is a Renewal Application of R01 DK064902, a study of lifestyle risk factors for GDM in Hispanic women.

 The proposed project builds upon the expertise of the investigative team in conducting randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions among Hispanic pregnant women (R01 DK074876; S3948 ASPH/CDC) and controlled trials of lifestyle interventions among low-income Hispanics with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes (R18 DK0658850; R18DK067549) and can readily be translated into clinical practice in underserved and minority populations.

 Study of a Postpartum Diabetes Prevention Program for Hispanic Women@highlight

The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a culturally and linguistically modified, individually-tailored lifestyle intervention to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among postpartum Hispanic women with a history of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy.
