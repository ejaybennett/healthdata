 Acute renal failure is one of the most feared complications of septic shock and occurs in 51% of patients with these conditions.

 Mortality at 3 months ranges from 36% to 60%.

 To date, these exists no consensus regarding the optimal time to initiate renal remplacement therapy (RRT).

 Retrospective and observational studies have suggested that early initiation of RRT could help to improve prognosis in these patients.

 Therefore, we aim to investigate wether early initiation of RRT (within 12 hours after a diagnosis of acute renal insufficiency at the "failure" stage according to the RIFLE Criteria), will reduce 90-day mortality as compared to deferred initiation of RRT (48 to 60 hours after diagnosis), in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock who develop acute renal failure.

 Secondary objectives include: to compare the impact of the two RRT strategies on 28, 180 et 360 day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of RRT, duration of ICU stay and duration of overall hospital stay.

 In addition, quality of life at 90 and 360 days will be evaluated using the EQ5D questionnaire.

 Tolerance of both strategies will be compared in terms of metabolic disorders, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema by overload, hypotension, hemorrhagic complications, and dependence on RRT at hospital discharge.

The purpose of this multicentric, randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the timing of renal replacement therapy initiation (early vs delayed) has an impact on mortality at 90 days in patients with severe acute kidney injury at the failure stage (according to RIFLE criteria) during the initial phase of septic shock.
