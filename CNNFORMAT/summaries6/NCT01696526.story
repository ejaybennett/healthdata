(firstQuint)Bioefficiency of of Conventional Fish and Vitamin D Fortified Fish.

 Study design: Human volunteers will receive conventional fish or vitamin D fortified fish for a period of 4 weeks.

 At baseline and after 4 weeks, 25(OH)D3 will be measured in serum as the main outcome variables.

 Additional outcome variables are the Ca concentration in serum, PTH concentration in serum.

 Groups/Cohorts Assigned Interventions 1.

 Placebo group receiving conventional fish 2.

 intervention group receiving vitamin D fortified fish.
