(firstQuint)Integrated Telemonitoring and Nurse Support Evaluation.

 Patients after an episode of acute heart failure have an increased risk of rehospitalisation and impaired prognosis for survival.

 Neither a sole mobile nurse support nor a sole telemonitoring system has been able to provide consistent data on a beneficial influence on prognosis.

 Furthermore, the influence of frequent measurements of NT-pro-BNP in a home setting of heart failure patients has not been investigated so far.

 This study will test a new medical device (software) for optimizing treatment of heart failure patients and evaluate its impact on outcome of these patients.

The purpose of the study is to test a new medical device for optimizing treatment of heart failure and compare its effect on outcome of patients with a recent hospitalization for worsening heart failure
