(thirdQuint)VIPER: Veterans Integrated Pain Evaluation Research.

 Studies have already shown that pain following amputation might be caused by differences in a person's genes.

 This study may help us find out how genes affect the way you feel pain and why you may feel more or less or different kinds of pain than another person with a similar amputation.

 What we learn in this research study may lead to discoveries as to why some painkillers work better for some people than others.

The purpose of the study is to learn about the causes of different types of pain that can occur in people who have had an amputation.

 By gathering information through blood tests, photographs, a nerve test, and questionnaires, we hope to de-code how each individual's special characteristics affect the type and amount of pain they experience in their amputated limb.
