(firstQuint)The Role of HIF-2a in the Pathogenesis of Reflux Esophagitis.

 Reflux esophagitis is thought to be caused by gastric acid that refluxes into the esophagus, causing injury.

 Newer data suggest that reflux of gastric juice into the esophagus stimulates HIF-2a, which increases production of inflammatory cytokines.

 These cytokines are thought to lead to reflux esophagitis.

 The investigators plan to study the relationship of HIF-2a to inflammatory cytokines in patients with known gastroesophageal reflux disease and reflux esophagitis.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2a on the production of inflammatory cytokines that lead to reflux esophagitis.
