(thirdQuint)Comparison of the Tibiofemoral Rotational Alignment After Mobile and Fixed Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 Reference of tibial AP axis for implanting tibial component in total knee arthroplasty have not been concluded.

 This study can suggest appropriate method for alingning the tibial component to accurate tibial AP axis.

 Comparison of the Tibiofemoral Rotational Alignment After Mobile and Fixed Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty@highlight

The anatomic landmark for the anteroposterior (AP) axis of the proximal tibia and its variability was investigated in this study in order to determine whether a certain landmark could be employed as a reference axis for the proximal tibia after rotating platform mobile bearing (RP-MB) and fixed bearing (FB) total knee arthroplasties (TKAs).
