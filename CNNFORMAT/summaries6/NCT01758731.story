(thirdQuint)Study of Olaparib With Radiation Therapy and Cetuximab in Advanced Head and Neck Cancer With Heavy Smoking History.

 Outcomes for heavy smokers with locally-advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) treated with standard chemoradiation have been traditionally poor, suggesting a critical need for translation of novel biologically-based targeted approaches into clinical practice.

 In clinical trials, the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitor Olaparib has been combined with other systemic agents, including paclitaxel, irinotecan, carboplatin and gemcitabine, in the treatment of patients with various solid tumors.

 Pre-clinical models have shown cooperative effects of combining PARP inhibition with radiation.

 A combined modality approach utilizing RT in combination with C225 and Olaparib after induction chemotherapy represents a rational, targeted approach for investigation in locally-advanced HNSCC patients.

 Study of Olaparib With Radiation Therapy and Cetuximab in Advanced Head and Neck Cancer With Heavy Smoking History@highlight

This is a research study that plans to learn more about the safety and tolerability of an investigational drug called Olaparib, in combination with radiation therapy and cetuximab.

 Hypothesis: Intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent C225 and Olaparib represents a feasible, biologically-based alternative to standard chemoradiation, with acceptable toxicity, for treatment of locally-advanced HNSCC in patients having a 10 pack-year smoking history.
