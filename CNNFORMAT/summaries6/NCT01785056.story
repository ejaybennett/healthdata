(fifthQuint)IVIG Treatment in Systemic Sclerosis.

 The investigators propose a double-blind controlled trial of 24 patients with Privigen(R) (Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% liquid treatment) with 3:1 randomization.

 Subjects with scleroderma will be given 2 g/kg/mo of Privigen(R) or placebo (Albuminar(R)-5) for 6 months.

 Scleroderma is generally a progressive disease, and while the skin does improve with time in some patients, others have progressive disease in spite of aggressive treatment.

 Also, spontaneous improvement in other organ systems is even less likely.

 Patients entered into the trial will have failed to respond to standard of care treatment over the past 4 months.

 Thus, the investigators feel that any actual improvement observed can be attributed to the IVIG treatment.

 Since this is a pilot study, future larger controlled trials will be necessary to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, but the investigators are hoping that this study will give us signals that will guide the future clinical trial.

 IVIG Treatment in Systemic Sclerosis@highlight

The purpose of this research is to study the effects of Privigen (intravenous immunoglobulin) on the skin in patients with scleroderma.

 Approximately 24 subjects will take part in this investigator-initiated study at Georgetown University Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital.

 This study will last for one year (12 months).

 This research is being done because systemic sclerosis can cause severe, progressive organ involvement.

 The investigators hope this study treatment will improve the outcomes in this disease, including skin, muscle, joint, gastrointestinal, and lung involvement.
