(fifthQuint)Surviving Aneurysm Surgery: A Pilot Study on Exercise Training in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Patients.

 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) affects 4% of men aged 65-79, a prevalence rising as our population ages.

 As most patients suffering rupture die immediately, elective AAA repair is critical and the National AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP) is being implemented across the UK to identify AAAs for elective repair.

 Manchester is the first major urban population to be screened.

 The UK had the highest mortality rates following elective open AAA repair in Europe (7% v 3.

5%); the AAA Quality Improvement Programme's (AAAQIP) target is to reduce this to under 3.

5% by 2013.

 The benefits of exercise across a broad spectrum of medical conditions are now increasingly recognised; especially in the elderly.

 Exercise training may reduce mortality and complications in major surgery.

 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measures cardiopulmonary reserve and predicts outcome in major surgery.

 The Manchester CPET study group demonstrated that anaerobic threshold (AT) and peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) predict 30 and 90-day mortality in elective AAA repair.

 The investigators propose a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether a structured exercise programme improves fitness measured by CPET, and the optimal duration of training for AAA surgery.

 As over 90% of AAAs detected by screening are 65 are the fastest growing segment of our population.

 This pilot study will contribute to public health policy drive on the impact of physical activity on functional capacity, quality of life and independence.

 Surviving Aneurysm Surgery: A Pilot Study on Exercise Training in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Patients@highlight

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement or ballooning of the main artery supplying high pressure blood from the heart to the body.

 AAAs may continue to stretch until they burst (rupture) causing 7000 deaths per year in the United Kingdom (UK); 2.

1% of all deaths in men over 65.

 Planned repair before rupture is critical and the National AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP) is being introduced to identify AAAs in men before rupture.

 Screening will identify over 9000 men per year with a previously undiagnosed AAA.

 More than 90% of screen detected AAAs are small, do no require repair, enter ultrasound follow-up (surveillance) and may benefit from exercise to improve fitness before repair.

 Over 4000 elective AAA repairs per year are performed in the UK and it has been suggested that exercise training and weight loss may reduce mortality and complications of AAA repair.

 This pilot study will examine the feasibility of supervised exercise training for patients with AAAs and determine the optimal duration of training to achieve worthwhile improvements in fitness.
