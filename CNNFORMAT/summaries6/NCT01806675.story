(secondQuint)18F FPPRGD2 PET/CT or PET/MRI in Predicting Early Response in Patients With Cancer Receiving Anti-Angiogenesis Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate 18F FPPRGD2 PET/CT or PET/MRI for prediction and early assessment of response to anti-angiogenesis therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancers.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo 18F FPPRGD2 PET/CT or PET/MRI at baseline, 1 week, and 6 weeks (or standard of care follow-up) and 18F FDG PET/CT at baseline and 6 weeks (or standard of care follow-up) .

 After completion of study imaging, patients are followed up at 12 months.

The purpose of the study is to conduct research of a new PET radiopharmaceutical in cancer patients.

 We will assess the uptake of this novel radiopharmaceutical in subjects with breast cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancers requiring antiangiogenesis treatment.
