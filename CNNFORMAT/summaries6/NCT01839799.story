(firstQuint)A Randomized Phase II/Genomic Trial of Two Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients With Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.

 The objective of this study are to determine the relapse-free survival of resected pancreatic cancer patients following two novel regimens.

 The secondary objectives are 1) to assess the toxicity of each of these regimens in this setting.

 2) To perform exploratory genomic analyses as a means of assessing molecular characteristics potentially associated with risk of relapse with one or both of the regimens.

 3) To determine the relationship between known mutations and metabolic activity as measured by FDG-PET and risk of relapse.
