(thirdQuint)Study of Safety of Foradil in Patients With Persistent Asthma.

 This was a 26 week, double blind, randomized, active-controlled safety study of Foradil in free combination with inhaled corticosteroid versus an inhaled corticosteroid alone in adults and adolescent patients with persistent asthma.

 The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that the addition of formoterol fumarate to fluticasone propionate is non-inferior to fluticasone propionate alone in terms of the risk of composite serious asthma related events (asthma-related hospitalization, asthma-related intubation, and asthma-related death).

 The individual components of the composite primary endpoint (i.

e.

, asthma-related hospitalization, asthma-related intubation and asthma-related death) will be assessed as a secondary safety endpoints.

 The efficacy assessment is the secondary objective.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the risk of serious asthma-related events (asthma-related hospitalizations, asthma related intubations, and asthma related deaths) in adolescents and adults (12 years of age and older) taking inhaled formoterol fumarate/fluticasone propionate combination was the same as those taking inhaled fluticasone propionate alone.
