(secondQuint)Study Comparing Pathological Responses Observed on Colorectal Cancer Metastases Resected After Preoperative Treatment Combining Cetuximab With FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in RAS and B-RAF WT Tumors.

 This is a phase II , openlabel, randomized study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of potentially or borderline resectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (RAS and B-RAF WT tumors ), who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

 The study is designed to compare pathological responses observed after pre-operative chemotherapy cetuximab with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.

To analyze the pathological tumor response on resected colorectal cancer metastases after preoperative treatment with cetuximab combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI regimen in a prospective cohort (RAS and B-RAF WT tumors) and to correlate this response with patient's outcome.
