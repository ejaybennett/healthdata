 Children below 4 years of age and in public day care were invited to participate in this prospective study.

 During this period the parents were asked to fill in a home protocol recording upper respiratory tract symptoms as: rhinitis, cough, fever, ear ache.

 After 6 weeks and 12 weeks the children had scheduled visits to the ENT department, where an ENT doctor examined the throat, nasal cavity and the ear drums for otitis media.
