(fifthQuint)Crossover Trial Determining the Efficacy of Dry Powder Mannitol to Improve Lung Function in Subjects Aged 6-17 Years.

 Drug Name: Dry powder mannitol for inhalation Phase: 2 Indication: Paediatric and adolescent cystic fibrosis Trial Centres: Multicentre Sponsor: Pharmaxis Limited, 20 Rodborough Road, Frenchs Forest, NSW 2086 Australia Trial Duration: 27 weeks Number of Subjects: 160 Trial Design: Randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Primary Objective: To determine the effect of eight weeks of twice-daily treatment with inhaled dry powder mannitol on lung function (FEV1) in subjects with CF who are aged six to seventeen years Dosage and Administration: Trial drug is to be administered via a dry powder inhaler.

 - Mannitol 400 mg b.

d.

 for 8 weeks followed by a 8-week washout followed by placebo b.

d.

 for 8 weeks; or - Placebo b.

d.

 for 8 weeks followed by a 8-week washout followed by mannitol 400 mg b.

d.

 for 8 weeks.

 Statistical Methods: - The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based upon a modified Grizzle model for crossover design.

 Absolute and relative changes from baseline in percentage of predicted FEV1 and FVC will be analysed.

 The absolute change in percentage of predicted lung function (FEV1 and FVC) will be the primary focus.

 Changes in FEF25-75 will also be analysed.

 - Safety data will be analysed descriptively (listings and summary tables).

 Crossover Trial Determining the Efficacy of Dry Powder Mannitol to Improve Lung Function in Subjects Aged 6-17 Years@highlight

It is hypothesised that inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.

d.

 will lead to a significant improvement in the absolute change in percentage of predicted FEV1 from baseline following eight-weeks of trial treatment compared to treatment with inhaled placebo b.

d.

 Any improvement in FEV1 is considered clinically meaningful; however, this trial has set a threshold of 3% for the purposes of determining an appropriate sample size for statistical power whilst retaining trial feasibility in an orphan disease population.
