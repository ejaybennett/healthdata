(secondQuint)Pilot Trial of Novel Circumcision Device.

 Objective: To conduct a proof-of-concept study to determine the potential utility of a novel, adjustable single-visit, disposable device to facilitate rapid adult circumcision.

 Design: Prospective pilot trial of a novel surgical device Setting: Tertiary care Veterans Administration medical center Patients: 5 adult males Interventions: Circumcisions performed by junior trainees using an adjustable, single-size surgical-assist device constructed by the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory.

 Main Outcome Measure(s): The attending surgeon and trainees completed standardized forms after each procedure to assess technical problems and ease of use.

 Follow-up visits were scheduled to evaluate adverse events, post-operative pain, cosmetic outcomes and participant satisfaction at 3, 8, 30 and 90 days post-operatively.
