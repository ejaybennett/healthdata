(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Epitope Peptide To Treat HLA-A*24 or A*02-positive Advanced Solid Tumors.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope peptides (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced solid tumors.

 In this phase I/II trial, the investigators examine using a combination of the two peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201-positive advanced solid tumor patients who are refractory to standard therapy.

In this study, the investigators examine using a combination of two types of HLA-A*2402 (or HLA-A*0201)-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for advanced solid tumor patients who are refractory to standard therapy.
