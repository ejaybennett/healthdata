(thirdQuint)A Comparison Between Sonoguided Injection Corticosteroid and Hyaluronic Acid Injection in Treatment of Trigger Finger.

 This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled study.

 Patients with the diagnosis of trigger finger will be recruited and enrolled from Taipei Veteran General Hospital PM&R outpatient clinic.

 Subjects will be randomized into two groups; hyaluronic acid and triamcinolone acetonide injections, both via ultrasound-guided with one injection only.

We hypothesize that through the anti-inflammatory property of the hyaluronate acid, the treatment effects will be as effective as the traditionally used steroid injections with equal or even lower recurrence rate for treatment of trigger finger.

 We expect that injections of hyaluronate into tendon sheath could become a new treatment option for trigger finger.

 A Comparison Between Sonoguided Injection Corticosteroid and Hyaluronic Acid Injection in Treatment of Trigger Finger@highlight

The study is to compare the effect between steroid injection and Hyaluronic acid in treatment trigger finger.

 Using sonoguided injection technique achieves more accurate injection location and therapeutic effect.

 We hypothesize hyaluronic acid has both lubricant and anti-inflammation effect in treatment of trigger finger, and can provide better outcome and lower adverse effect than steroid injection.
