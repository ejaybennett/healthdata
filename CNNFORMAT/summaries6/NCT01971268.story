(thirdQuint)Compare the Success Rate of T3 Dental Implant (Biomet 3I) With or Without Platform-switch Concept.

 Patients from a private practice who received dental implants (T3 dental implant Biomet 3I) from November 2012 to October 2013 were eligible to enter the study.

 Two groups were formed: one group received a T3 dental implant with platform switch concept and the other received an implant with platform matched type of connection.

 We evaluate osseointegration at T1 (12 weeks) and marginal bone position in relation to the implant platform at baseline (implant installation) T0 and again at T1 and T2.

 From data recorder in T0,T1 and T2, we evaluate changes in marginal bone position.

In patients that received a T3 (Biomet 3I) dental implant, does the use of platform-switch concept compared to the use of platform-matched concept, refrain marginal bone loss during osseointegration phase (t=12 weeks =T1) and from then to final rehabilitation (t= placement of the final restoration = at 18 weeks=T2)
