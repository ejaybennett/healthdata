(fifthQuint)Preemptive Femoral & Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Blocks for THA Acute Pain.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultrasound (using sound waves to produce an image)-guided regional anesthesia (local numbing medicine) to the hip area given in addition to general anesthesia just prior to same day elective hip arthroscopy, is effective in reducing acute postoperative pain, and time to discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.

 In addition, the study aims to examine whether this regional anesthesia medication has any effect on the study subjects' use of pain medication both during and after the procedure, return to function, and quality of life in the 6 month period after the surgical procedure.

 Although hip arthroscopy is a routine procedure, the best method for pain control is not well established, and is the purpose of this study.

 Preemptive Femoral & Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Blocks for THA Acute Pain@highlight

The goal of the study is to evaluate via a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial, whether ultrasound-guided single femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks with ropivacaine 0.

5% with epinephrine (1:200,000) as a tracer for intravascular injection (total 30 ml) vs.

 saline with epinephrine (1:200,000) (total 30 ml), given just prior to same day elective hip arthroscopy, is effective in reducing acute postoperative pain (NRS scores), postoperative opiate consumption, and time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit.

 Differences between groups with respect to postoperative quality of life and functional scores will also be evaluated.
