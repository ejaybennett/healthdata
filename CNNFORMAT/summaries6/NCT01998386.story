(fifthQuint)Tooth Whitening With Hydrogenperoxide in Adolescents.

 The aim of the proposed controlled clinical trial will be to assess colorimetric changes and increased dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to tooth whitening with 6% and 7.

5% hydrogen peroxide using home kits with whitening strips.

 Adolescents aged 12 to 20 years will be allocated to different groups based on treatment (n = 16 per group): 1) placebo; 2) 6.

0% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); 3) 7.

5% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); and 4) 7.

5% hydrogen peroxide (Oral B 3D White - Oral-B).

 After the whitening procedures, the participants will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale for tooth sensitivity and digital spectrophotometry for the measurement of changes in color.

The specific objective of this study is: - Evaluate and quantify colorimetric changes in young permanent anterior teeth; - Compare the efficiency and efficacy of three gels used for self-administered home whitening and an over the counter whitening strip; - Analyze the increase in dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to home whitening with 6% and 7.

5% hydrogen peroxide with and without the addition of calcium (whitening strips); - Assess sensitivity, comfort and acceptance of whitening strips by patients; - Assess patient satisfaction with the method and material used for home whitening.
