(secondQuint)Studying the Effects of Copaxone on Retinal Health Using Optical Tomography Over 24 Months.

 The primary aim of this study is to explore whether treatment with Copaxone may decrease accumulation of axonal loss, as measured by retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with RRMS over 24 months and compared to a reference population of healthy controls.

 The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of GA on total macular volume (TMV) on OCT in patients with RRMS over 24 months.

 We will also explore how the 24-month changes of RNFLT and TMV on OCT relate to progression of disability, as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).

 Studying the Effects of Copaxone on Retinal Health Using Optical Tomography Over 24 Months@highlight

This is a prospective, observational, single-blinded, longitudinal, 24-month OCT study of the evolution of axonal loss, as evidenced by loss of RNFLT and TMV, in RRMS patients treated with GA and in healthy controls.
