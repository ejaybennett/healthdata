(thirdQuint)Corneal Epithelial and Stromal Thickness Distribution in Keratoconus.

 Purpose of the study: To characterize epithelial and stromal thickness distribution in keratoconic eyes and to develop epithelial and stromal thickness-based variables for keratoconus detection.

 Methodology: SD-OCT corneal scans of 20 eyes with keratoconus (group 1) and 20 healthy eyes with > 2 diopters (D) of corneal astigmatism as controls (group 2) are studied.

 Keratoconus patients referred to the Eye Dpt.

 of the University Hospital North Norway for CXL (Corneal collagen cross-linking)- treatment and healthy subjects seeking preoperative evaluation for refractive surgery at SynsLaser(R) Kirurgi AS Tromso clinic are examined by corneal SD-OCT as a part of their routine examination.

 Analysis of their SD-OCT corneal scans is used for the purpose of this study.

Two cross-sectional meridional corneal profiles (along steepest and flattest meridians, located by a Scheimpflug-based corneal topography) for each individual are obtained by using a RTVue100(R) (Optovue Inc.

 Fremont, California, USA), 26000-Hz SD-OCT across the central 6mm diameter of the cornea.

 Corneal Epithelial and Stromal Thickness Distribution in Keratoconus@highlight

The purpose of the study was to identify corneal epithelial- and stromal-thickness distribution patterns in keratoconic eyes using spectral-domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

 Study Hypothesis: SD-OCT provides necessary details about the distribution of corneal epithelial and stromal thicknesses for identification of a pattern characteristic for early keratoconus.
