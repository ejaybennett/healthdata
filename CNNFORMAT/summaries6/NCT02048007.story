(fifthQuint)Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin: Morbidity Study.

 The investigators will assess childhood infectious disease morbidity and macrolide resistance over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral azithromycin to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo.

 Randomization of Treatment Allocation.

 In each site, 30 communities within a contiguous area of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized into the azithromycin or placebo arm.

 The investigators will use a simple random sample separately for each study site, but without stratification or block randomization within the site.

 These communities are being randomized from the same pool of communities eligible for a sister trial (Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin (MORDOR) - Morbidity Study).

 Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To assess whether macrolide resistance is greater in a population-based community sample of pre-school children, or in a clinic-based sample of ill pre-school children Specific Aim 2: To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatments of pre-school children can eliminate ocular chlamydia in a hypoendemic area Specific Aim 3: To assess the diversity of the microbiome of the nasopharynx, nares, conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract.

 Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin: Morbidity Study@highlight

The long-term goal of this study is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin treatments as an intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and increasing growth, and for the potential selection of antibiotic resistance.

 The investigators propose a set of 3 cluster-randomized trials comparing communities randomized to oral azithromycin with those randomized to placebo.

 To assess the generalizability of the intervention, investigators will monitor for antibiotic resistance, which could potentially limit adoption of mass antibiotic treatments.

 The investigators will also assess several measures of infectious diseases.

 The investigators hypothesize that mass azithromycin treatments will reduce childhood morbidity and will be accompanied by an acceptable level of antibiotic resistance.
