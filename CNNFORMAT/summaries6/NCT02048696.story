(thirdQuint)Effect of Exercise Training on Left Ventricular Function in Patients Post Myocardial Infarction.

 Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction are at significant risk for developing heart failure and progressive left ventricular dysfunction One of the proposed mechanisms responsible for this observation is reduction in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density due to elevated cell membrane protein G - protein coupled receptor kinase -2 (GRK2).

 It is known that exercise training preserves heart function in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction.

 The mechanism for this is not clear.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of exercise training on myocardial function and GRK2 levels in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, with the hypothesis that exercise training in this population reduces GRK2 levels and preserves or improves myocardial function.

 Effect of Exercise Training on Left Ventricular Function in Patients Post Myocardial Infarction@highlight

Patients who have suffered a heart attack are at risk of developing worsening heart function and heart failure.

 Exercise training has a beneficial effect on heart function and prevents heart failure.

 The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of exercise training on heart function in patients who have suffered a heart attack.
