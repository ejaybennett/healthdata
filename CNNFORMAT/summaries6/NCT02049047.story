 Study of Everolimus in Patients With Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma Previously Treated With Chemotherapy@highlight

Given the high expression of IGF-1R and pAKT proteins in thymoma tissues, able to sensitize tumors to mTOR inhibition, and the anticancer activity of the mTOR inhibitors, clinical evaluation in thymoma and thymic carcinoma seems to be very interesting.

 Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral everolimus 10 mg once daily.

 Efficacy and safety profile of Everolimus will be evaluated.
