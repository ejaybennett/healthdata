(thirdQuint)Snacking, Satiety &Weight: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.

 Snacking has been implicated in the obesity epidemic, but judicious snacking can help control appetite and calorie intake and add nutrient-dense foods to the diet.

 The investigators hypothesize that snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.

e.

 KIND snacks with almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.

e.

, conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.

 The investigators further hypothesize that the benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced when portion is clearly defined and controlled by packaging.

 Finally, the investigators hypothesize that these effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear guidance about the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in their diets.

 Hypotheses: 1.

 Snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.

e.

 KIND snacks with almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.

e.

, conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.

 2.

 The benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced when portion size is clearly defined and controlled by packaging.

 3.

 These effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear guidance about the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in their diets.

 Snacking, Satiety &Weight: A Randomized, Controlled Trial@highlight

Proposed is a parallel-design randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of consuming two types of snacks on a daily basis for a 12-week period on health outcomes, diet quality, and self-reported satiety in a group of overweight adults.

 The types of snacks to be studied are KIND snack bars with almonds and typical American snack foods).
