(fifthQuint)Randomized Clinical Trial of Labetalol Versus Hydralazine for Severe Hypertension in Obstetric Patients.

.

 Study Hypothesis:This is a non inferiority trial and study hypothesis is that labetalol is equal or better than hydralazine.

 Patients diagnosed to have severe hypertension(on repeat measurement of BP after 15 minutes of rest), admitted in 24 hour period of emergency, meeting inclusion criteria, will be included.

 One hundred eighty patients will be enrolled after informed consent and randomly allocated to each treatment arm by 1:1 randomization through simple random allocation.

 All eligible pregnant or post partum women with systolic blood pressure 160mm of Hg or diastolic BP 110 mm Hg, on repeat measurement after 15 minutes of rest, admitted through emergency and outpatients department, will be invited for participation in the study.

 They will be enrolled after informed consent.

 Drug treatment will be assigned using simple random sampling.

 INCLUSIONS CRITERIA Pregnant or post partum patients with systolic blood pressure 160mm of Hg or diastolic BP 110 mm Hg, on repeat measurement of blood pressure after 15 minutes of rest, meeting following inclusion criteria will be included.

 1.

 Pregnancy =>28 wks with gestational hypertension, severe preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, eclampsia and unclassified hypertension.

 2.

 Postpartum patients, upto 72 hours after delivery, diagnosed as gestational hypertension, severe preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, eclampsia and unclassified hypertension.

 3.

 Patients with singleton or multiple pregnancy.

 4.

 Patients of all ages and parity.

 EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1) Patients with asthma.

 2) Patients with cardiac failure and heart block.

 3) Patients with pacing device in place or any type of cardiac arrhythmia.

 DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENT Data will be recorded on a case report form (CRF).

 Group A will receive intravenous(IV) labetalol bolus doses administered over 2 minutes, at 10 minutes interval.

 Initially dose of 20mg will be administered, and if required repeated in increments of 40 mg,80 mg,80mg,80mg every 10 minutes till SBP becomes 160 or DBP 110 mm Hg then another bolus of 5 mg hydralazine will be repeated and consultation with medical/cardiovascular/critical care specialist will be sought.

 Blood pressure and pulse will be recorded at 10 minutes interval till blood pressure is reduced below threshold levels (SBP160 or DBP 110 mm Hg, then third dose will be given.

 If SBP or DBP thresholds are still exceeded after 20 minutes then similarly 4th dose of 5 mg will be given.

 Failure to reduce SBP160 or DBP 110 mm Hg, then another bolus of 40 mg labetalol will be repeated and emergency consultation with medical /cardiovascular /critical care specialist will be sought.

 Our use of alternate treatment for severe persistent hypertension in both groups is keeping in line with the most recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist's committee opinion 2011 recommendation.

 Cardiotocography (CTG) will be done in pregnant women on admission and it will be repeated 2 hour after initiation of therapy.

 Primary outcome measures will be lowering of SBP140/90mm Hg after 20 weeks of pregnancy in previously normotensive women, proven by antenatal record.

 2).

 Preeclampsia will be defined as BP 140/90 mm Hg along with proteinuria 1+ on dipsticks in a previously normotensive, non-proteinuric woman, proven by antenatal record.

 3).

 Chronic Hypertension will be diagnosed by history of preexisting hypertension & or by detecting persistent elevation of BP140/90 mm Hg.

 prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

 4).

 Severe preeclampsia will be defined as BP 160/110 alongwith proteinuria1+ on dipstick with or without one or more of the following features i.

e headache, visual disturbance, upper right quadrant/epigastric pain, pulmonary oedema, elevated alanine aminotransfrease (ALT), raised creatinine, hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR) in a previously normotensive non proteinuric woman, proven by antenatal record.

 5) Eclampsia will be diagnosed by generalized tonic clonic seizures in woman with hypertensive disorder not attributable to any other cause.

 6) Efficacy will be defined as lowering of systolic BP to 160 or DBP 110 mm of Hg after the administration of consecutive maximum (4 or 5)doses of allocated drug treatment.

 8) Maternal hypotension will be defined as systolic BP 100b/m in the absence of fever & cardiovascular disease.

 10)Normal Cardiotocograph(CTG) Will be defined as having following 4 features i) Baseline heart rate 110-160beats/minute ii) Variability>5-25 beats/minutes iii) aleast 2 accelerations of >15 b/m lasting for15 seconds.

 iv) No decelerations.

 11)Adverse effect on fetal heart rate (FHR) will be defined as i)presence of any type of deceleration without uterine contraction ii)Reduced variability40 minutes, iii) Variable & late decelerations, in the presence of uterine contractions iii) FHR160b/m detected on CTG 2 hour after starting treatment, with a baseline normal CTG on admission.

 12)Placental abruption will be defined as clinical features of uterine tenderness with evidence of retroplacental clot at delivery.

 13) Oliguria will be defined as urinary output4 hours.

 14) Neonatal bradycardia will be defined as heart rate SD whereas mean reduction in MAP, number of boluses of antihypertensive, mean dose to achieve desired level of control will be analyzed by student's t test.

 Qualitative variables i.

e control of BP, severe persistent hypertension, maternal hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, headache, palpitation, nausea vomiting,dizziness ,oliguria, placental abruption, adverse effects on fetal heart rate, still birth, neonatal bradycardia, caesarean section, Apgar score 160b/m, variability 40 minutes, variable and late decelerations, will be excluded and stratification will be done for normal CTG and CTG with subtle abnormalities but with normal baseline FHR 110-160b/m on enrolement i.

e i) Absence of accelerations ii) reduced variability <5 beats/min for < 40 minutes iii) early decelerations in the presence of uterine contractions.

 Adverse effect on FHR will be studied on all antenatal women and neonatal outcomes (Apgar, neonatal bradycardia) will be studied on patients delivering within 24 hours of enrolement.

 Furthermore assessment model based on logistic regression will be developed for response to either drug in terms of patient & disease characteristics i.

e ethnicity, age group, parity group, socioeconomic status(income groups), gestational age group, pregnancy status whether antepartum or post partum and disease characteristics i.

e type of hypertension and blood pressure level on admission.

 Multinomial logistic regression will be applied and Odds ratio will be calculated for all these factors.

 Randomized Clinical Trial of Labetalol Versus Hydralazine for Severe Hypertension in Obstetric Patients.

@highlight

Severe Hypertension in pregnancy demands urgent treatment because of high mortality & morbidity in obstetric patients.

 Hydralazine, the most commonly used agent, causes sudden hypotension and tachycardia.

 Labetalol because of combined and blocking effects lacks these side effects.

 Cochrane systematic review could include only three trials of comparison of hydralazine with labetalol.

 All three had sample size ranging from 20-60 obstetric, including 19-30 pregnant women.

 This review could not conclude about comparative effects due to insufficient data and suggested that further trials should compare hydralazine with nifedipine or labetalol, and to report severe persistent hypertension and adverse feto-maternal effects.

 OBJECTIVES:1) To compare efficacy of labetalol versus hydralazine for control of pregnancy related severe hypertension.

2) To compare adverse maternal and fetal effects of the two drugs.

 3) Furthermore, to develop risk assessment model for response to treatment, in terms of patient and disease characteristics.

 STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

 SETTING & DURATION OF STUDY: Gynaecology Unit I, Civil hospital Karachi over a period of 1 year.

 METHODS: Total one hundred eighty patients with, severe hypertension(systolic blood pressure(SBP)160 and/or diastolic blood pressure(DBP) 110 mm Hg) at greater than 28 weeks of pregnancy or upto72 hours after delivery, will be enrolled.

 In each group 90 patients will be allocated to intravenous labetalol or hydralazine using simple random sampling.

 Primary outcome measures will be lowering of SBP to <160 mm Hg and DBP <110 mm Hg and severe persistent hypertension.

 In addition maternal hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, adverse effect on fetal heart, still birth and neonatal bradycardia will be measured.

 EXPECTED OUTCOME: Efficacy and side effects of labetalol against hydralazine, in our population will be determined.

 Assessment model for response to treatment, will help in choosing a drug with better efficacy and minimal side effect profile for different patient and disease profiles.
