(fifthQuint)Building Capacity for Specialized Services Through eConsultation.

 Research Question: What is the impact of, and the patients' perceptions of, an electronic consultation service (eConsult) between primary care professionals and specialists? The goal of this project is to evaluate a novel electronic referral-consultation process between primary care providers and specialists utilizing e-consultation which will: 1.

 provide patient-specific advice to primary care providers (PCPs) in place of a formal consultation 2.

 provide patient-specific advice to PCPs for further investigations or treatment options prior to the formal consultation, resulting in fewer visits required with the specialist 3.

 provide opportunity for PCPs to receive patient-specific advice on patients previously seen by a specialist but no longer followed in the specialty clinic, resulting in enhanced confidence of transition of care back to primary care providers thus promoting best practices and continuity of care Intervention: Building on a recent successful pilot project, and using a pre-existing secure web-based collaboration space, primary care providers will submit a patient-specific clinical question to a specialist using a standardized electronic form that permits attachments (e.

g.

, laboratory results, digital images).

 The specialist responds within one week by either: i) directly answering the question (negating the need for referral), ii) asking for additional patient information, or iii) requesting an in-person referral.

 Results from the pilot study (n=18 primary care providers) demonstrated a high level of provider satisfaction and resulted in the avoidance of 43% of referrals.

 Design: A mixed methods evaluation approach will be used to meet the objectives of this study.

 Quantitative: This will be a clustered randomized controlled trial using a stepped wedge design, a type of crossover study in which different groups (in this case, primary care providers) cross over from the control arm to the intervention arm at different time points.

 100 providers from across the province of Ontario will be recruited and allocated to either Group 1 (50 providers) or Group 2 (50 providers).

 Please note that in this study, the investigators are recruiting primary care providers only.

 Group 1 providers will have access to specialties already available through eConsult in the first year of intervention, while Group 2 will use standard referral practices during this time period and will begin using eConsult in the second year of intervention.

 This offset in start times allows the investigators to control for temporal effects, as Group 2 will serve as a control for Group 1.

 This stepped wedge approach helps overcome several pragmatic issues and avoids ethical concerns as all providers will eventually be offered access to the eConsult service.

 Referral data will be collected from the Insitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (Ontario), the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and IPDB databases for all 100 providers .

 The change in referral rates from the baseline to the end of the study for both Groups will be analyzed, while controlling for temporal effects.

 Sample size: With 50 providers per arm, the investigators will be able to detect a change of 0.

06 referrals/patient/year (referral rate for 12 specialties (# of available specialties increases monthly): 0.

31 referrals/patient/year) with 80% power using a two-sided test at a 5% level of significance and using a coefficient of variation of 0.

38 to account for clustering.

 In year two or three, the investigators will recruit randomly selected patients whose cases involved the eConsult system, to gain insight into their views on the acceptability of electronic consultations.

 Quantitative Analysis: A clustered, multi-level Poisson regression analysis will be conducted using the stepped wedge analysis approach outlined by Hussey and Hughes to examine the impact of the eConsult system on referral rates while accounting for practice (model, urban/rural), provider (age, sex, years since graduation, baseline referral rate, foreign trained) and patient-level (age, sex, socioeconomic status, health status, baseline referral rate) characteristics.

 Qualitative Analysis: Patient interview data will be evaluated using a constant comparative approach with a combination of inductively and deductively determined codes.

 Expected outcomes: The eConsult service has the potential to greatly reduce the number of unnecessary referrals, which will reduce overall wait times and provide specialists with more time to see patients with more urgent needs.

 By implementing this system, it is anticipated that there will be a reduction in avoidable referrals, decreased patient wait times and improved communication between primary and specialty care.

 Building Capacity for Specialized Services Through eConsultation@highlight

The consultation-referral process is complex, involving several steps including 1) the PCP recognizing the need for specialist advice/intervention, 2) patient agreement on seeing the specialist, 3) referral letter and information sent to specialist, 4) appointment booked and communicated, 5) patient visit(s) with the specialist and 6) communication back to the PCP.

 There are many factors during this process which limit the effectiveness and efficiency of patient care.

 These include inequitable access for patients and providers, long wait times before specialist advice received/implemented, delayed communication and mismatched consult expectations.

 These gaps result in significant breakdowns in transitions of care, inappropriate treatment, patient dissatisfaction and potential harm.

 Moreover, not all individuals are willing or able to travel to see specialists in a large academic medical centre even when recommended by the PCP.

 eConsultation has the potential for improving transitions in care through improved communication ensuring that patients are seen by the right specialist, when necessary, with the right information and in a timely manner.

 The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of eConsultation on specialist referral rates.
