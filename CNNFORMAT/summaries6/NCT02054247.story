(secondQuint)Continuous And Pulsed Ultrasound Treatments On Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

 The study included 36 carpal tunnel syndrome patients who were randomly divided into 3 groups.

The first group received 0 W/cm2 placebo ultrasound treatment.

 second group received 1.

0 W/cm2 continuous ultrasound treatment and the third group received 1.

0 W/cm2 1:4 pulsed ultrasound treatment 5 days a week for a total of 15 sessions.

 All patients were also treated with night splints during the treatment.

 Pretreatment and posttreatment Visual Analogue Scale scores, Symptom Severity Scale scores, Functional Status Scale scores, median nerve motor conduction velocity.

 and distal latency and sensory conduction velocity of median nerve in the 2nd finger and palm were compared.
