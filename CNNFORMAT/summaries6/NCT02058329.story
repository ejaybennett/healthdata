(thirdQuint)A Geriatric Home Visit Program to Reduce Post-Hip Fracture Complications.

 All patients post hip fracture on the hospital's rehabilitation service that will be discharged to home will be enrolled after obtaining consent.

 Patients will be randomized into the intervention group and the usual standard of care group.

We will be recruiting a total of 100 patients , with equal numbers for each group.

All patients will undergo an initial assessment by a Geriatric fellow prior to discharge .

 The intervention group will be seen at the time of discharge in the hospital and at home at 1, 3, and 6 months post hip fracture.

 The control group will be seen at the time of discharge in the hospital and then again at 6 months for follow up.

 The two groups will then be compared for multiple known complications post hip fractures well as mortality.

The overall goal of the project is to reduce the incidence of post hip fracture morbidity and mortality by conducting geriatric fellow periodic home visits.

The assessment will be multidisciplinary and will include assessments of functional status, depression, environmental risks and medical conditions.

 This group will be compared against a group followed by the usual standard of care post hip fracture.
