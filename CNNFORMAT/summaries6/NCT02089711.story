(thirdQuint)Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Normative Data Collection Study (S-2013-2).

 This multi-center, prospective, observational (non-interventional) study is the second in a series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device.

 This study is conducted in normal Japanese volunteers.

 The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal eyes.

 The study will include at least 224 (enrollment target: 249) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit 32 to 40 subjects with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males.

 All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit.

 All examinations performed on the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in Europe and in the U.

 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Normative Data Collection Study (S-2013-2)@highlight

This study is being initiated to create a normal database including measures of optic nerve head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device.

 The range will be determined for each structural parameter across normal eyes in Japanese subjects, and the measurements stratified according to age.
