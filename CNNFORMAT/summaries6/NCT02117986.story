(thirdQuint)Efficacy and Mortality of a Loading Dose of Colistin in Critical Ill Patients.

 It is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate a scheme with and without a loading dose of 6 million international units of colistin, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 million international units every 8 hours intravenous.

 The study should be conducted in 3 hospitals in Chile, in critically patients presenting infection by multidrug Gram-negative bacteria and requiring be treated with colistin for at least 48 hours.

 The objectives of the study are: to evaluate the clinical and microbiological response, and mortality.
