(fifthQuint)Study of the Therapeutic Vaccine (ISA101/ISA101b) to Treat Advanced or Recurrent Cervical Cancer.

 A majority of cervical carcinomas are caused by an uncontrolled, persistent infection with high risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).

 ISA101/ISA101b is a novel therapeutic synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine targeting HPV16 which is being developed and has shown efficacy in patients with high-grade premalignant vulvar lesions caused by HPV with only minor toxicity.

 For most advanced cancers, chemotherapy remains the treatment modality of choice but has been considered to be immunosuppressive.

 However, accumulating evidence indicates that many modalities of conventional chemotherapy not only are less immunosuppressive than previously thought but in fact can exert favorable effects on the tumor micro-environment by interfering with suppressive immune cells and by stimulating the release of immune activating molecules by tumor cells.

 Thus chemotherapy may enhance tumor-specific immunity and synergize with cancer immunotherapy.

 Addition of pegylated interferon alpha (IFN) two-b (IIb) to vaccination might even further improve the immune response.

 This multicenter, open label, non-randomized Phase I/II study will be performed to assess the safety and tolerability of the ISA101/ISA101b vaccine, and the immune modulating effects of ISA101 (with or without pegylated IFN)/ISA101b when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab.

The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and the HPV-specific immune responses of different doses of ISA101 vaccine with or without pegylated IFN as combination therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

 To qualitatively assess the safety profile and the HPV-specific immune responses of ISA101b vaccine compared to ISA101 at the same dose levels.

 To assess the safety and the HPV-specific immune responses of ISA101b vaccine with carboplatin, paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.
