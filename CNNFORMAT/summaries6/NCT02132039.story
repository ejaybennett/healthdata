(fifthQuint)A Randomised Controlled Trial of Home-based Exercise Intervention for Caregivers of Persons With Dementia.

 The proposed study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial for two years.

 We will compare the efficacy of a home-based structured exercise programme (12-step sitting Tai Chi) for both carers and care recipients with a standard non-exercise social contact control in the treatment of depression among caregivers of persons with dementia.

 The study hypotheses include: 1.

 The structured home-based exercise programme will reduce caregiver depression.

 (Primary outcome) 2.

 The home-based exercise will improve caregivers' cognitive performance, quality of life and balance ability at the end of the study.

 (Secondary outcome) 3.

 The home-based exercise will improve the cognitive performance, quality of life and balance ability of persons with dementia at the end of the study.

 (Secondary outcome) 4.

 We also hypothesise that BDNF gene modulates mood changes in response to exercise intervention.

 (Secondary outcome).

 A Randomised Controlled Trial of Home-based Exercise Intervention for Caregivers of Persons With Dementia@highlight

The study aims to compare the efficacy of a home-based structured exercise programme (12-step sitting Tai Chi) involving both persons with dementia and their caregivers with a standard non-exercise social contact control in treating depression among caregivers.

 The effects of exercise on their cognition, quality of life and balance ability are also assessed.

 We will also examine if BDNF polymorphisms modulate mood changes in response to exercise intervention.

 Focus groups will be organised at the end to find out the facilitators and barriers in taking up exercise.

 The findings may offer an avenue of intervention by providing a low cost, relatively safe and effective treatment for dementia caregivers, which may in turn benefit the persons with dementia.
