(firstQuint)A New Method To Reduce Gastric Missing Areas in Capsule Endoscopy.

 Background:Capsule endoscopy is widely used to observe small intestine.

While it may miss important areas in stomach,especially in fundus.

So far,physicians have no methods to observe stomach without no-missing areas by capsule endoscopy.

 Objective:To explore a new method to reduce the areas missed by CE.

 Methods:Subjects were prospectively enrolled.

Every subjects will undergo 2 capsule endoscopies and 1 gastroscope.

First capsule endoscopy,every subject have a better gastric preparation before swallowing CE and change position during the procedure.

Second capsule endoscopy,every subject have a conventional CE.

 And then, every subject have a gastroscope.

 Measurements:The primary measurements included safety, gastric preparation, visualization of gastric mucosa and rate of lesion detection.

It is a single center, prospective and self-controlled trial.

 We'd like to explore a new method by changing position to reduce gastric missing areas in Capsule Endoscopy(CE)
