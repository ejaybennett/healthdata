(firstQuint)Intravenous Nitrite Infusion for Reversal of Cerebral Vasospasm After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

 This is a pilot single center, open-labeled study.

 Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to the hospital and who meet entry criteria will be offered enrollment into the study.

 The patients will be enrolled promptly after detection of the presence of cerebral vasospasm.

 Subjects will receive sodium nitrite infusion.

 One dose cohort is planned, 64 nmol/min/kg sodium nitrite (0.

1325 mg/hour/kg; 0.

0442 ml/hour/kg at a concentration of 3mg/ml).
