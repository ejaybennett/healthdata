(firstQuint)Clinical Study of Generic and Brand Bupropion in Depression.

 The protocol is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study in 75 subjects (target, 60 evaluable) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) receiving bupropion HCl 300mg XL (branded or generic).

 Subjects will be studied for a total of approximately 28 weeks: an approximately 4 week lead-in phase during which participants remain on their existing bupropion product, and then four randomized cross-over phases of approximately 6 weeks on each of the four bupropion study drugs (brand and 3 generics).

 For each of the four bupropion products, subjects will have (a) formal pharmacokinetic evaluation (24 hr plasma and urine) at steady-state, (b) every 3-week in-person standard structured clinical evaluations of depressive symptoms and side effects, and (c) once daily smart phone-based assessments to capture information on symptoms and side effects.
