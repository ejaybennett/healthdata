(secondQuint)31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Fructose Study.

 This study uses 31P spectra acquired from the liver in healthy subjects following a fructose drink to monitor ATP levels.

 This is also related to baseline BMI, liver glycogen and liver lipid levels.

 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Fructose Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an oral fructose challenge on liver adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reserves using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a potential measure measure of liver health.
