(secondQuint)Bioequivalence Study of Two Formulations of Pregabalin Capsules 150 mg.

 This was a randomized, open label, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study under fasting condition.

 The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next morning were given orally one capsule of the test drug (Pregabalin 150 mg produced by Dexa Medica) or one capsule of the reference drug (Lyrica(R) 150 mg, Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, Germany).

 Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), at 20, 40 minutes, and 1, 1.

5, 2, 2.

5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 hours after drug administration.

 Seven days after the first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug.

 The plasma concentrations of pregabalin were determined by using validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) method.
