(firstQuint)Comparison of Autogenous Periosteal Pedicle Graft and Collagen Membrane in Management of Periodontal Intrabony Defects.

 Twenty patients suffering from advanced chronic periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial.

 Each subject contributed matched pairs of two- or three-walled intrabony defects.

 Each pair of periodontal defects were randomly assigned into the experimental group; periosteal pedicle graft guided tissue membrane or the positive control group; bioresorbable collagen guided tissue regeneration membrane.

 Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months postoperatively.
