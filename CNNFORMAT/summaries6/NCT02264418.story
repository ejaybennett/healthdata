(secondQuint)Safety and Tolerability of ODM-203 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours.

 The safety profile of ODM-203 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-203 to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies.

 The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM 203 will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels.
