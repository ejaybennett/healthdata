 To determine the extent to which PreView increases the likelihood that primary care patient participants will receive mammograms, pap tests, colon cancer tests or prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing discussions with primary care physicians compared with participants who receive usual care.

 II.

 To determine the extent that PreView increases participants' readiness to be screened for breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with usual care.

 III.

 To determine the extent that PreView increases the likelihood that PSA testing will be discussed in primary care physician visits compared with usual care.
