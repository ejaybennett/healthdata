(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Disturbances in Calcitonin Gene in Patients With Gum Disease and Osteoporosis.

 Periodontitis is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease which includes various modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors.

 The non modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms like metabolism associated genetic polymorphisms ( Vitamin D and Calcitonin).

 Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures.

 Bone loss is a common feature shared between periodontal disease and osteoporosis.

 Out of all genetic factors Calcitonin gene polymorphism contributes to the development of both osteoporosis and chronic periodontitis.

 A Study to Assess the Disturbances in Calcitonin Gene in Patients With Gum Disease and Osteoporosis@highlight

Osteoporosis and Periodontitis are multifactorial diseases which share common risk factors.

The aim of the present study is to ellucidate polymorphisms in Calcitonin receptor gene? in patients with Osteoporosis and Periodontitis.
