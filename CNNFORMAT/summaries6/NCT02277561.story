(fifthQuint)Voxel Based Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Predicting Response in Patients With Brain Metastases Undergoing Whole Brain Radiation Therapy or Stereotactic Radiosurgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if voxel based diffusion tensor imaging will provide an early predictive assessment of therapy response, as compared to radiographic volumetric response criteria.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for a total of 10 fractions also undergo VB-DTI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 1 week after WBRT initiation, and 7-11 days after completion of WBRT.

 Patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) without WBRT also undergo VB-DTI MRI at baseline and 7-11 days after completion of SRS.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months and then every 6 months until death.

 Voxel Based Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Predicting Response in Patients With Brain Metastases Undergoing Whole Brain Radiation Therapy or Stereotactic Radiosurgery@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well voxel based diffusion tensor imaging in predicting response in patients with brain metastases undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery.

 Voxel based diffusion tensor imaging (VB-DTI) may allow doctors to measure response to whole brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery earlier than is possible with a standard magnetic resonance imaging.

 The earlier ability to measure response may allow for consideration of alternative therapies at an earlier stage.
