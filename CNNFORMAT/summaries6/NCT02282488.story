(secondQuint)Effect of the Level of Dietary Protein on the Infant Hormonal Profile and Body Composition.

 The primary objective of this clinical trial is to show that infants taking (from birth) either a formula with a low protein content (LoF) or breast milk will have an IGF-1 level, at 4 months, 25% lower to the IGF-1 measured in infants that received a high protein content formula (HiF).

 The secondary objectives are: The hormonal profile; the Fat mass (FM) gain and the Lean mass (LM); the metabolomics and aminogramm during the first year of life.

 Subjects are included in the study for a duration of 5 years.

 From birth to 4 months they are exclusively fed BF or FF.

 From 4 months of age they can start diversification, but they maintain the starter formulas until 12 months (the BF group will receive LoF).

 Subjects are then followed up until 5 years of age.

 Effect of the Level of Dietary Protein on the Infant Hormonal Profile and Body Composition@highlight

A double blind, controlled, randomized, single site clinical trial of 2 parallel groups (Low protein formula =LoF and High protein formula =HiF) with a breastfeeding group (BF) as reference from birth to 1 year of age and a follow up period from 1 year to 5 years of age.
