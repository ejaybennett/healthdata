(thirdQuint)Comparative Bioavailability Study of Two Different Sources of Eslicarbazepine Acetate.

 Phase I, two-centre, open-label, randomized, gender-balanced, single-dose, laboratory blinded, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study in 2 groups of 20 healthy male and female subjects.

 The study consisted in 2 periods separated by a wash-out of at least 7 days between doses.

 To demonstrate the bioequivalence (BE) between two active product ingredient (API) sources [current API source - marketed formulation (MF) versus new API source - to-be-marketed (TBM)] of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL).
