(fifthQuint)Internet-based Support for Young People With ADHD and Autism - a Controlled Study.

 Young people between age 15 and 25 with ADHD and/or autism spectrum disorders are consecutively included in the project and are offered coaching and support during eight weeks over the internet (chat and e-mail) twice a week.

 Data is collected before and after the intervention as well as six months after end of treatment using self-report questionnaires (Sense of Coherence (SOC), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)).

 A parent or a partner completes an assessment scale for the next of kin.

 When treatment is completed, the young people are interviewed using a structured interview pertaining to the quality of the intervention.

 A comparison group matched for age, gender and neuropsychiatric diagnosis is offered treatment as usual (TAU) and is assessed at the same time points as the intervention group.

 The individuals are not randomized to the intervention and comparison groups due to difficulties to recruit if the individuals do not know group assignment in advance.

 In all, 24 individuals will be offered the intervention and 24 individuals will receive TAU.
