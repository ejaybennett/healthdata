(fifthQuint)A Trial of the Implementation of iFOBT in General Practice.

 Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common type of cancer in Denmark and is a leading cause of cancer death.

 Since 2000, the incidence has been increasing by 1-1.

5% each year.

 The estimated 5-year survival rate is currently 80% for stage I cancer, 50% for stages II and III, and mu g/L will be considered 'negative' and >50 mu g/L as 'positive'.

 The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design, and is executed in the Central Denmark Region.

 Municipalities of the region are randomised when to receive a CME, and are included sequentially in the study during the first seven month of the study period.

 The CME are arranged on scheduled GP-meetings in each municipality and will consist of a 45 minutes lecture on CRC diagnosis and use of iFOBT.

 Besides a CME, the intervention consist of a start package (10 iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is sent to GPs when they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx.

 one month after inclusion.

 The study period is one year.

 Data analysis will focus on the uptake and clinical use of iFOBT in general practice, the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC and the clinical implications.

 Perspectives This study will investigate iFOBT and explore its role in general practice.

 To our knowledge, this study will be one of the first and most thorough investigations of this test in a primary care setting.

 The results will bring important knowledge of how to improve the diagnostics of colorectal cancer in the future and hopefully reduce time to diagnosis.

 Especially for patients who do not meet the traditional Danish criteria for fast-track referral, this study will be a corner stone in the identification of more efficient ways to locate patients at risk of developing CRC.

 At both national and international level, this project will contribute with important knowledge that may provide better planning of CRC diagnostics in the future.

 A Trial of the Implementation of iFOBT in General Practice@highlight

Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common, and a leading cause of cancer death.

 The evaluation of patients suspected to have CRC is difficult due to poorly predictive alarm symptoms and many patients present with uncharacteristic or vague symptoms.

 The faecal marker of human globin, iFOBT, could play an important role in aiding the general practitioner in detecting CRC.

 Hypothesis It will be possible to implement iFOBT in general practice as a test performed on patients who do not fulfill the criteria for fast-track referral for colorectal cancer, but whose symptoms could indicate an undiagnosed colorectal cancer.

 Aim To implement iFOBT in general practice and evaluate the uptake and clinical use of the test.

 Furthermore, we want to investigate the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC, and the clinical implications.

 Materials and methods The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design.

 Clusters are constituted by the 18 municipalities in the central Denmark Region, and these are randomised when to receive a continuous medical education (CME).

 The date of inclusion is defined as the first working day in the month the CME is planned to be conducted.

 The CME is part of an intervention aimed to facilitate the implementation of iFOBT in general practice.

 Besides a CME, the intervention consist of a start package (iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is sent to GPs when they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx.

 one month after inclusion.

 The inclusion period is during the first 7 month of the study period, the study lasts for one year.

 Perspectives This study will provide important knowledge on how to improve CRC diagnostics in general practice.
