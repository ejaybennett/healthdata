(fifthQuint)Relationship of Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Therapy and Long-term Outcome in Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 This study is a single-center and random analysis.

 The consecutive hospitalized patients with ACS at Beijing Mentougou District Hospital from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 were enrolled.

 Figure 1 is a flow diagram of the trial.

 There were 259 males (54.

9%) and 213 females (45.

1%) with an average age of 61.

1 11.

0 years.

 Patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results were recorded.

 All patients were divided into the Hp-negative group (Hp-, group 1.

) and the Hp-positive group (Hp+).

 The Hp+ group were randomly divided into two groups: Group 2, the Hp+ with eradication therapy (Hp+ Therapy); and Group 3, the Hp+ without eradication therapy (Hp+No Therapy).

 Relationship of Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Therapy and Long-term Outcome in Acute Coronary Syndrome@highlight

Objective: To investigate the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and the prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a Chinese population and to explore the significance of Hp eradication therapy in preventing major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients on dual antiplatelet treatment.

 Methods: To analyze 472 ACS patients with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 in the department of cardiology at Beijing Mentougou District Hospital.

 Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, the Hp-negative patients (Hp-); Group 2, the Hp-positive patients with eradication therapy (Hp+ Therapy); and Group 3, the Hp-positive patients without eradication therapy (Hp+ No Therapy).

 All patients took 13C urea breath test, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),homocysteine (HCY) and other biochemical indicators.

 The investigators explored the correlations of Hp eradication therapy with MACE (including recurrent myocardial infarction, revascularization and death) and UGIB after 3 to 5 years of follow-up using survival analysis.
