(firstQuint)Randomized Controlled Trials Comparing Clinical Outcomes of 3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Surgery for Gastric Cancer.

 A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the 3D laparoscopic technique.

 The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
