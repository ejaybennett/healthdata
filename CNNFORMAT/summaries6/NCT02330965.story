(thirdQuint)Mechanistic Studies of Phase III Trial With BAF312 in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.

 This study is complementary to a multi-center, randomized, double-blind,parallel-group, placebo-controlled, variable treatment duration study comparing the efficacy and safety of BAF312 to placebo in patients with SPMS (NCT01665144).

 Investigators will explore both immunological and neuroprotective mechanisms of BAF312 (siponimod), a novel agent in the setting of a SPMS clinical trial.

 This study is part of a multi-center study, with the University of Michigan serving as the central site.

 Mechanistic Studies of Phase III Trial With BAF312 in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of BAF312 (siponimod) on select immune and neuronal (nerve) cells by examining laboratory specimens (blood and/or spinal fluid) at multiple time points, prior to, and following the initiation of BAF312 or placebo treatment, in patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) who are enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT01665144) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BAF312.
