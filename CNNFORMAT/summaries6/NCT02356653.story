(thirdQuint)Expanded Access Protocol Using CD3+/CD19+ Depleted PBSC.

 Only 25-30% of patients who may benefit from HSCT have a matched related donor.

 There is a higher rate of complications using cells from an unrelated or partially matched related donor.

 T cells within the donor cells may cause a complication called graft vs.

 host disease (GVHD).

 The goal of this study is to use the CliniMACs device to remove the T cells that cause GVHD, called T cell depletion.

 Expanded Access Protocol Using CD3+/CD19+ Depleted PBSC@highlight

The goal of this protocol is to expand access for patients who lack a fully HLA (Human leukocyte antigen) matched sibling donor and who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

 These patients have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease for which HSCT is indicated.

 These patients are not eligible for other Children's Hospital of Philadelphia IRB approved protocols that utilize CliniMACs technology for T depletion.
