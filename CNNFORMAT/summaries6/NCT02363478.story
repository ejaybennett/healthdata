(fifthQuint)Long Term Effect of Buspirone on Esophageal Function and Esophageal Symptoms in Patients With Systematic Sclerosis (SSc).

 Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the skin and other organs especially the gastrointestinal tract.

 Esophageal involvement occurs in up to 90% of SSc patients.

 Symptoms of esophageal disease are due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal motor dysfunction.

 Thus, heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia have been reported by 80% of SSc patients.

 The gold standard method for the assessment and detection of esophageal dysmotility in SSc patients is manometry.

 High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the most accurate tool to assess esophageal motility using multiple closely spaced (<2cm) pressure sensors, assessment of esophageal motility is more sensitive ,and allows a better assessment of LES and of the whole esophagus.

 Buspirone, an orally available 5-HT1A receptor agonist, exerts a beneficial acute effect on esophageal motor dysfunction and LES pressure and may enhances an important role in improvement of esophageal symptoms in SSc patients.

 Thus, the investigators will conduct a study to evaluate the putative beneficial long-term effect of buspirone i) on esophageal motor dysfunction and ii) on esophageal symptoms in symptomatic SSc patients.

 Long Term Effect of Buspirone on Esophageal Function and Esophageal Symptoms in Patients With Systematic Sclerosis (SSc)@highlight

Esophagus is commonly affected in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and esophageal function is compromised in about 75% of patients.

 Previous studies have shown that buspirone, an orally available 5-HT1A (serotonin 1a receptor agonist), enhances esophageal motility in healthy volunteers.

 Recently, the investigators observed that a single dose of buspirone (10mg) improves lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function in patients with SSc and esophageal involvement .

 Objectives: To evaluate the effect of continuous administration of buspirone on esophageal dysfunction and related symptoms in SSc using high resolution manometry (HRM).
