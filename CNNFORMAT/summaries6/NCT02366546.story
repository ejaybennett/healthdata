(firstQuint)Investigator Initiated Phase 1 Study of TBI-1301.

 Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with fludarabine, NY-ESO-1-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*02:06 positive patients with solid tumors which are 1) unresectable, refractory to standard therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc), and 2) NY-ESO-1-expressing.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and in vivo kinetics, and the secondary is to evaluate clinical effect.
