(thirdQuint)The ONE Study nTreg Trial (ONEnTreg13).

 The ONE Study aims to explore the feasibility, safety and efficacy of regulatory cell therapies as adjunct immunosuppressive treatments in the context of living-donor renal transplantation.

The clinical trial presented here (ONEnTreg13) will test autologous, polyclonally expanded CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ nTregs as a somatic cell-based medicinal product.

 The objective of this study is to determine whether administration of nTregs to recipients of living-donor kidney transplants is safe and able to polarize the immunological response of the recipient away from graft rejection and towards graft acceptance, allowing a reduction in the doses of pharmacological maintenance immunosuppression.

 The ONE Study nTreg Trial (ONEnTreg13)@highlight

The aim of this trial is to collect evidence of the safety of administering autologous CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) to living-donor renal transplant recipients.

 In addition, the study will determine whether post-transplant nTregs infusion allows a tapering of conventional maintenance immunosuppression within 60 weeks after transplantation.
