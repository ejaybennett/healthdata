(thirdQuint)Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Effect on Depression and C-Reactive Protein Levels After 8 Weeks of Treatment.

 This study will investigate the effectiveness of MBCT as a primary treatment for MDD.

 Twelve unmedicated subjects with MDD were enrolled in the study.

 All subjects with MDD underwent depression severity assessment at baseline and after the 8-week intervention was complete to measure change.

 In addition, the subjects underwent blood sampling at the same time points to measure C-Reactive Protein change over the 8 weeks.

 The primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the efficacy of MBCT as a primary treatment for adults with MDD.

 We will also measure change in the inflammatory biomarker C-Reactive Protein for an examination of the effects of depression treatment on this measure.

 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Effect on Depression and C-Reactive Protein Levels After 8 Weeks of Treatment@highlight

This study will investigate the efficacy of an 8-week course in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) by ;measuring change from baseline to completion of treatment at 8 weeks in terms of depression severity using the Hamilton Depression Ratings Scale.

 We will measure change in C-Reactive Protein, a measure of inflammation, over the same time period.
