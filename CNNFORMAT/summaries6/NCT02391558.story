(firstQuint)Clinical Evaluation of Noninvasive OCT Angiography Using a Zeiss OCT Prototype to Compare to Fluorescein Angiography.

 Fluorescein angiography (FA) is the standard and generally accepted method to identify vascular features in the retina, detecting capillary dropout and neovessel growth.

 Its value is undeniable and is a routine ophthalmological examination.

 However, it requires intravenous injection of fluorescein, which can cause nausea, vomiting and, rarely, anaphylaxis and death.

 New OCT angiography methods can detect, noninvasively red blood cells flow and, therefore, identify well the retinal vasculature.

 It is crucial and of major interest to evaluate the clinical utility of this new methodology comparing this information with the one obtained from fluorescein angiography.
