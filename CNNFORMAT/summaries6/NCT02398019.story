(fifthQuint)Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Use of an Adsorption Membrane (OXIRIS) During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery.

 Patients whom meet inclusion criteria would be proposed to participate once admitted to cardiac presurgical ward.

 After informed consignment, on those patients randomized to CPB-OXIRIS(R), PrismafleX eXeed cent II (Hospal) with OXIRIS(R) set will be irrigated with saline during preparation and irrigation of CPB circuit.

 PrismafleX eXeed cent II (Hospal) with OXIRIS(R) set will then be connected to CPB circuit.

 Blood flow between 150-200 ml/min will be derivatised from the CPB circuit into the PrismafleX eXeed cent so that it all flows through OXIRIS(R) membrane.

 Flow, pressure and alarms will be controlled by PrismafleX eXeed cent independently from CPB circuit.

 OXIRIS(R) membrane will be only employed for adsorption (neither convection nor diffusion will be performed) during all CPB time.

 Using CPB flow, patient will not require venous catheter access neither changes in CPB normal settings.

 All blood samples collected during study will be obtained from CPB circuit or central venous catheters (standard cardiac surgery protocol).

 During all CPB time besides the ordinary cardiac surgery assistance team, a supplementary RRT expert team will be present in those patients randomized to CPB-Oxiris.

 Blood samples and all variables will be equally collected and registered in the control group (CPB-Standard) with no modifications from CPB standard practice.

 Adverse events will be reported (in less than 24 hours if severe) to the sponsor center to be properly evaluated.

 If the severe adverse event (SAE) is finally evaluated by the study board as related to the intervention arm, urgent notification to health authorities must proceed and study should be interrupted until further decision.

 Investigators will warrant a correct protocol application.

 Study data will be reviewed by an external monitoring committee from the clinical assay research central unit (UCICEC - IDIBELL).

 Monitors will contrast registered data from the collection data form (CDF) with data from patients medical record.

 All patients medical records will be indefinitely saved in electronical format to be reviewed if necessary.

 1.

 Registered variables and follow-up.

 Renal function related parameters.

 Plasma creatinine and urine output will be registered at baseline, prior to CPB, at ICU admission, 6 hours ,12 hours, 24h postCBP and every 24h during the first week after cardiac surgery in order to evaluate postcardiac surgery acute kidney injury based on AKIN criteria (AKIN criteria Kidney inter.

,2012; 2: 1-138.

) Urinary cell cycle arrest proteins TIMP-2 y IGFBP-7 will also be quantified at ICU admission.

 Renal function will be checked at hospital discharge.

 Inflammatory response parameters: Interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-18 (IL-18), complement 5a (C5a), high mobility binding protein 1 (HMBP-1), RANTES, oligodeoxyribonucleotide alfa (GRO-alfa), leukocytes count, lactate, D-dimer, free plasma hemoglobin, HO-1, free iron and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels will be determined in plasma.

 These determinations will be measured baseline (0hours), and at times T1 (end of CPB), T2 (ICU admission) and T3 (24hours from ICU admission).

 Ordinary laboratory parameters: Plasmatic urea, potassium, albumin magnesium, phosphate, glucosa, sodium, chloride, Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hemogram and coagulation times will be determined following the ordinary cardiac surgery protocol (every 8 hours during the first 24h).

 Clinical and respiratory parameters: Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters will be registered every hour.

 Arterial and venous gasometries with arterial lactate will be determined every 8 hours during the first 24 hours.

 Temperature, heart rate, arterial blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), central venous pressure, vasopressor and/or inotrope dose will be registered during surgery and at ICU according to standard protocol.

 Demographic and clinical record data: Age, gender, weight, height, relevant clinical records, previous or chronic medication, type of cardiac surgery, surgery times, time on CPB, surgical complications, blood transfusions during and after surgery, prognostic scores (SOFA, APACHE II and SAPS II), ICU stay, hospital stay.

 Clinical outcome (survival at discharge, 28 and 90 days) and renal outcome (renal function, and RRT requirements).

 2.

 Techniques Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) LPS plasmatic concentration will be measured using an Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test (Levin, J, et al.

 Thrombosis Et Diathesis Haemorrhagica.

 1968; 19:186).

 This technique is performed when LAL proteolytic factors are activated by LPS.

 Life Technologies kit will be used for this (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

 NephroCheck(R) Commercial diagnostic kit based on an in vitro fluorescence immunoassay technique in order to quantify TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7 urinary biomarkers.

 Cytokines analysis IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNF, MCP-1, HMBP-1, RANTES, GRO quantification will be performed with multiplex new technology.

 MILLIPLEX (Millipore) magnetic balls system will be used.

 3.

 Study Limitations SIRS harmful effects which are initiated during CPB may persist after surgery and this is an important limitation as our study only evaluates the use of increased adsorption membranes during CPB.

 However, investigators hypothesize that the important effect on cytokine and LPS levels during CPB will be observed.

 Furthermore, patients requiring non emergent cardiac surgery represent a non absolutely homogeneous cohort and this could introduce potential bias in main and secondary objectives.

 To avoid this potential bias, temporary sequential randomization has been performed and advanced chronic renal failure patients have been excluded.

 Cell cycle arrest proteins, due to tests high cost, will only be determined (single check point) at ICU admission and this could also introduce a temporary bias as this biomarkers could still be undetectable in urine sample.

 However, investigators think that ICU admission is probably the most important moment after surgery in order to decide or change clinical strategies as this could be done based on cell cycle arrest proteins values.

 4.

 Statistical analysis Missing data will try to be avoided by an exhaustive patients follow up by study investigators.

 Data registry has been created to include all variables with written individual data collection forms (DCF).

 Data will be bedside registered by the study members but final software database registration will be done by the statistics outside investigator who has no contact with patients situation.

 Cytokines and LPS levels will be introduced in DCF when measured.

 Statistical analysis will be done by the statistics investigator who wont have any role in patients selection, randomization, or follow up.

 SPSS v.

 20.

0 for statistical analysis will be used.

 Variable distribution will be studied and logarithmic transformation will be used on those variables that don't present normal distribution, presumably cytokine and LPS levels.

 Univariate analysis comparing clinical, demographic, biochemical, metabolic, hemodynamic and respiratory baseline variables between both arms (CPB-OXIRIS(R) and CPB-Standard), will be done with two-tailed t test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.

 Variables determined several times (T0, T1, T2, T3) will be analysed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA test in order to demonstrate differences between both arms.

 Multivariate analysis will be completed to control those clinically relevant confounding variables as well as to discover baseline differences.

 Arm intervention (CPB-OXIRIS(R), CPB-Standard) will be considered as the main independent variable adding other control independent variables.

 Intervention safety will be measured by the presence of any adverse effects not related to the standard technique.

 This effects will be recorded during CPB, after CPB, and during the first 24 hours postsurgery.

 As the study is measuring cytokine and LPS levels in four different moments (T0, T1, T2, T3), in order to maximize statistical power and reduce control variables number, the area under the curve (AUC) well be determined for every cytokine and LPS during the first 24 hours.

 Due to this statistical maneuver investigators will obtain a continuous variable that represents each cytokine-LPS level during the biochemical study period (24 hours).

 To evaluate if the arm intervention improvement in terms of efficacy and safety could be related to cytokine and/or LPS levels during the first 24 hours, a mediation complementary analysis will be done considering cytokine-LPS (represented by AUC) as a mediator between the independent variable (intervention arm) and the effect we study.

 Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Use of an Adsorption Membrane (OXIRIS) During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery@highlight

Patients whom require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during surgery present systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to blood cell activation and cytokine release to circulation.

 SIRS can lead to organ dysfunction due to hemodynamic compromise (vasodilatation plus leak syndrome) and/or cytokine mediated cell injury.

 Renal dysfunction is a major adverse complication after CPB surgery.

 Investigators hypothesize that the use of an increased adsorption membrane (OXIRIS(R)) during CPB is safe and presents low technical complexity.

 The safe use of OXIRIS(R) will reduce both cytokine circulatory levels and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) circulatory levels therefore decreasing SIRS and its systemic effects specially those concerning renal function.

 Therefore, patients receiving (OXIRIS(R)) could potentially present less postcardiac surgery acute kidney injury (pAKI), lower intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and lower production of renal injury biomarkers (cell-cycle-arrest-proteins) tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7).
