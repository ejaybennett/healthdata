(fifthQuint)A Study to Compare Disease Progression and Modification Following Treatment With Paliperidone Palmitate Long-Acting Injection or Oral Antipsychotics in Participant's With Recent-onset Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform.

 A Prospective, matched-control, Randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), open-label, flexible-dose, study in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder to compare disease progression and disease modification following treatment with PP long-acting injection (once-monthly followed by 3-month injections) or OAP (Any of the following 7 OAPs are permitted: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone ER, perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone).

 The study consists of 3 parts.

 Part-1 (Oral Run-In Phase), Part-2 (Disease Progression) and Part-3 (Extended Disease Progression and Disease Modification) with unique endpoints.

 Screening period will be up to 4 Weeks.

 Duration of Parts will be as: 2 months for Part-1, 9 months for Part-2 and Part-3.

 All participants will initially receive oral paliperidone ER or oral risperidone in Part-1.

 After paliperidone/risperidone treatment in Part-1, participants will be randomized into 1:2 ratio to receive PP or OAP in Part-2.

 Participants who complete Part-2 will enter into Part-3 wherein OAP group participants of Part-2 will be re-randomized into 1:1 ratio to OAP-OAP group and OAP-PP group, and PP group will continue without further randomization.

 Treatment failures will be evaluated in Part-2 and Part-3 of the study.

 Also changes in cognition, functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be evaluated in the study.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout.

 A Study to Compare Disease Progression and Modification Following Treatment With Paliperidone Palmitate Long-Acting Injection or Oral Antipsychotics in Participant's With Recent-onset Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (PP: paliperidone palmitate once-monthly and 3-month injections) versus oral antipsychotic (OAP [that is oral paliperidone extended release {ER}, oral risperidone, or another OAP]) in delaying time to treatment failure.

 The study will also evaluate changes in cognition, functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume following treatment with PP compared with OAP in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder.
