(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profile of Insulin Lispro Using Needle-Free Jet Injection Technology.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study.

 Eighteen healthy volunteers will be recruited.

 Lispro (0.

2 units/kg) will be administered by jet injector or by conventional pen and a seven-hour euglycemic clamp test will be performed.

 PK-PD profiles of lispro will be calculated.
