(secondQuint)Rural Engagement in Primary Care for Optimizing Weight Reduction.

 Nearly 20% of the U.

S.

 population lives in rural communities.

 Rural residents suffer at a higher rate from obesity and obesity-related illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis.

 Local primary care physicians are an important resource for treating obesity in rural areas because of a lack of other community resources.

 This study is looking at how effective current, real-world primary care treatment models are in helping rural residents lose weight and maintain that weight loss.

 Physician clinics will be randomized (like picking numbers from a hat) to conduct one of the three methods.

 The method a participant is part of will depend on the method their physician's clinic is randomized to.

 The three methods involved in this study are: 1.

 Individual weight-management counseling in person 2.

 Group weight-management counseling, both in person and by telephone 3.

 Group weight-management counseling by telephone Participants will be in the study about 24 months.

 The number of in-person clinic visits and phone calls each participant will be asked to complete depends on the method.
