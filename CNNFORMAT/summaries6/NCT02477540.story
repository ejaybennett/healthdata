(firstQuint)A Safety and Efficacy Study of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Critical Limb Ischemia.

 If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's suitability.

 A participant that satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria is assigned a test group(2-time injection group).

 Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 days after bone marrow aspiration, and will re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 30 days after first injection.

 Participants will make a total of 5 hospital visits after registration, and Safety and Efficacy will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.
