(firstQuint)A Prospective, Multi-Center, Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of the NovaCross Micro-catheter in Facilitating Crossing Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) Coronary Lesions.

 The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NovaCross cent micro-catheter when used to facilitate crossing of Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries.

 The procedure will be conducted on consenting patients diagnosed with a CTO in a coronary vessel that requires revascularization after a previously failed attempt to cross or refractory to 10 minutes of conventional guidewire attempt.
