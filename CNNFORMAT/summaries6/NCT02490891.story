(firstQuint)Study of the Angiogenesis by PET/CT in Patients With Lymphoma.

 After inclusion PET scans with FDG tracer and with a specific tracer of angiogenesis will be performed on patient with lymphoma.

 After two cycles of chemotherapy PET scans with the same tracers will be performed.

 Overall survival and disease free survival will be monitored during 18 months.
