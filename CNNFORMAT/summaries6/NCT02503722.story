(thirdQuint)Sapanisertib and Osimertinib in Treating Patients With Stage IV EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Progression on a Previous EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of sapanisertib (MLN0128) (TAK-228) in combination with osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are resistant to previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

 (Dose escalation phase) II.

 To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MLN0128(TAK-228) in combination with osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC that is negative for the resistance mutation T790M (T790M negative [-]) and who are resistant to previous EGFR-TKI therapy.

 (Dose expansion phase) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in combination with osimertinib (AZD9291).

 II.

 To evaluate the response rate, disease control rate and progression free survival of the combination.

 III.

 To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination by studying baseline biopsies, resistance biopsies, and serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sapanisertib.

 Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (day 1 is omitted in course 1).

 Patients also receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sapanisertib when given together with osimertinib in treating patients with stage IV EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer that has progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

 Sapanisertib and osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
