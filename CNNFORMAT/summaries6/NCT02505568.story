(thirdQuint)A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab in Participant With Moderate-to-Severe Refractory Intestinal Behcet's Disease.

 This is an open-label (all participants know the identity of the intervention), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study of Infliximab in participant with Moderate-to-Severe Refractory Intestinal Behcet's Disease.

 The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (4 weeks), induction Phase for 8 weeks, and maintenance Phase for 24 weeks extending from Week 0 (baseline), and a safety Follow up visit (Week 36 or approximately 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug).

 The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 40 weeks.

 The mean decrease in Disease Activity Index for intestinal Behcet's disease (DAIBD) score of 20 or more will be evaluated primarily.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
