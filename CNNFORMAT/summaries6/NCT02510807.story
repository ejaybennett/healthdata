(thirdQuint)The PaWS (Pedometer and Walking Study).

 It has been established that exercise therapy has a central role in the management of peripheral arterial disease.

 Such treatment should be comprised of intermittent walking of sufficient distance to induce significant discomfort, and be carried out over a period of at least several months.

 Supervised exercise training utilizing intermittent treadmill walking is a well-validated treatment for claudication.

 Most prospective randomized single site studies have reported significant improvement in walking distance following supervised exercise training but not with non-supervised regimens.

 Furthermore, this has been acknowledged in both the current AHA/ACC 'Guidelines for the management of patients with peripheral arterial disease', which recommends supervised exercise training as an initial treatment modality with a Class 1A level of evidence (highest), as well as in the TransAtlantic Intersocietal Consensus, which provides an 'A' categorical recommendation.

 In spite of these peer-reviewed, published recommendations, supervised exercise training remains little used, expensive, not reimbursed by Ontario Health Insurance Plan, and therefore is rarely available to patients with claudication in Ontario.

 The purpose of this multicentre study is to examine whether the use of a pedometer enhances patient compliance with walking as compared to usual care.

 The PaWS (Pedometer and Walking Study)@highlight

The literature has shown that supervised exercise programs for patients with PAD and who report intermittent claudication (IC) have improved health outcomes, but this is not locally available.

 Introducing the use of a pedometer may act as a method to encourage patients to continue on their independent exercise regimen.

 There is very little literature which has examined the effectiveness using pedometers as a measure of compliance within this population.
