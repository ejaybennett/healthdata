(firstQuint)Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Using Realtime Dynamic Multileaf Collimator (MLC) Adaptation And Radiofrequency Tracking.

 Twenty patients 18 years of age or more and undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre for lung cancer will receive the new treatment.

 Participants will be physically able to undergo all aspects of treatment and intellectually able to provide written informed consent and complete questionnaires.

 Beacons will be implanted in the patients' lung to allow the Multi Leaf Collimator (MLC) tracking equipment to follow precisely the movement of the lung.

 The difference in ability to track tumour movement between MLC and the current standard method will be compared to identify changes in study outcomes.

 Audiovisual (AV) Biofeedback will also be used to regulate patients' breathing during radiotherapy.
