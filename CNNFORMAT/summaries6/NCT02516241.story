(secondQuint)Study of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) With or Without Tremelimumab Versus Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Urothelial Cancer.

 This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) monotherapy and MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) in combination with tremelimumab versus SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) first-line chemotherapy in treatment-naive patients with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV transitional cell carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) and to allow sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their normal clinical practice and national guidelines.

 The patients enrolled in the study will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with combination therapy, monotherapy, or SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility).

 Patients will be treated with MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) or MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) with tremelimumab, or treated with SoC until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

 Patients will be followed for up to 2 years.
