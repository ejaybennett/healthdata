 The primary study objective is to measure the effectiveness of using an innovative tracking system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including daily and rescue medication use, among children with asthma.

 The study objectives will be achieved using a pre-post design for the participants.

 The investigators aim to enroll at least 26 participants for a 3-month intervention period.

 With this pilot study, the investigators hope to examine the impact of self-management behaviors on health outcomes including asthma symptoms and quality of life measures.
