(fifthQuint)Prevalence and Intervention of Hypomagnesemia in Users of Proton-pump Inhibitors.

 Hypomagnesemia due to PPI use (PPIH) has a low frequency, but is a difficult to control side effect in clinical practice.

 It develops over years and results in severe symptoms related to the hypomagnesemia.

 Due to the widespread use of PPIs, the real number of PPIH may be high.

 Currently, there is a lack of intervention strategies and no general treatment protocols for patients exist.

 It is generally anticipated that PPI-withdrawal and antacid replacement therapy is the only working method to recover patients from the hypomagnesemia.

 However, this frequently resulted in rebound of gastric acid related complaints.

 The molecular mechanism of PPIH involves a reduction of Mg2+ absorption by the large intestine.

 Inulin fibers have been shown to have prebiotic properties.

 The intestinal microbiome ferments inulin and releases butyrate into the luminal compartment of the intestine.

 This results in acidification which enhances the uptake of Mg2+ and Ca2+ mediated by pH-sensitive ionchannels.

Thus inulin may counteract PPI induced reduction of luminal protons and therefore reestablish normal Mg2+ absorption.

 To this end cases with PPIH and controls underwent two 14 day trials of orally administered inulin under separated by wash-out periods of 14 days.

 During the experimental phase blood measures of electrolytes were monitored.

 Prevalence and Intervention of Hypomagnesemia in Users of Proton-pump Inhibitors@highlight

Hypomagnesemia is a severe side effect of longterm use of all available proton-pump inhibitors (PPIH).

 It develops due to intestinal malabsorption of Mg2+.

 This study investigates the application of dietary inulin fibers in users of proton-pump inhibitors with such a hypomagnesemia.

 To this end, repetitive short-term trials of 14 days of orally administered inulin, separated by a wash-out period of 14 days each were performed in cases of PPIH and controls.

 This study was not blinded or randomized.
