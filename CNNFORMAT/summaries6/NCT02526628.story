(thirdQuint)Thrombosis and Neurocognition in Klinefelter Syndrome.

 Klinefelter syndrome (KS) affects approximately 1 in every 600 males, but remains severely underdiagnosed.

 Men with KS are more prone to a wide range of diseases including thrombotic disorders.

 Also, neurocognitive function is impaired in KS.

 The background for the increased thrombosis proneness is not understood, and also it is not understood how testosterone treatment affects the thrombosis risk in KS.

 The effects of testosterone treatment on neurocognition in KS is also not completely understood.

 However, it is speculated that testosterone treatment at an early point could help improve the overall neurocognitive performance.

 In this study 30 males with KS receiving testosterone treatment, 30 males with KS not receiving testosterone treatment and 60 matched healthy male controls are included.

 After initial examination including blood testing and neurocognitive testing, the subjects are followed for 18 months and examined a second time.

 After initial examination the group of previously untreated KS males will be put on standard testosterone treatment according to current guidelines.

 Groups will be compared by measuring and array of markers for coagulation and fibrinolysis, including thrombin generation and fibrin structure analysis, to assess the haemostatic balance.

 Also, a wide array of neurocognitive tests and brain fMRI is applied to compare the neurocognitive function between the groups.

The haemostatic balance and neurocognitive capability of men with Klinefelter syndrome is compared to healthy controls by using specific biochemical assays for coagulation and fibrinolysis and a selection of neuropsychological tests and brain fMRI.

 Furthermore, the effect of gonadal status and any effects of long- or short-term testosterone treatment on the above mentioned parameters are investigated.
