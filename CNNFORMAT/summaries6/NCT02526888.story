(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between Diltiazem and ACT-541468 in Healthy Subjects.

 Because ACT-541468 appears to be mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, it is deemed of interest to investigate the potential influence of diltiazem, a well-known CYP3A4 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetic profile of ACT-541468.

 Safety of the concomitant administration of the two drugs will also be assessed.
