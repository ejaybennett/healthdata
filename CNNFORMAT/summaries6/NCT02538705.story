(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Neovasculgen (Pl-VEGF165) Gene Therapy in Patients With Diabetic Foot.

 This is a open clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in treating ulcers related to diabetic foot syndrome.

 Each patient will undergo several intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in calf of affected extrimity.

 Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their foots will be assessed clinically for ulceration.

 After this initial assessment, the patients will undergo intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a calf altered with ulcers due to diabetic foot syndrome.

 At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their foots will be assessed clinically for ulceration, and their foots will undergo non-invasive transcutaneous oximetry measurement.

 At six months post-injection, the patient will again complete study questionnaires, their foots will be assessed clinically for ulceration and will undergo non-invasive transcutaneous oximetry measurement.
