(fifthQuint)Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in the di@Bet.

es Study.

 1.

 Introduction Though type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a strong genetic component, the genetic basis of T2DM (at least the genes so far studied) do little to predict the risk of T2DM from traditional risk prediction criteria, such as family history, obesity, or previous glycemic alterations.

 From this perspective, T2DM is the prototype of a complex disease, considered to be the result of the interaction of different genes and of genes with environmental factors such as diet or sedentary habits.

 Because of this, the study of gene-environment interactions is extremely important in determining the risk of developing diabetes and/or asociated metabolic diseases.

 Our overall objective is to study these interactions in a representative sample of the Spanish population, as part of a study of prevalence and incidence of T2DM.

 Fatty acid transporters.

 The management of lipids, and particularly the regulation of the uptake of fatty acids by the tissues and their relation with disease is of much interest.

 Several proteins undertake the transport, with some of the most important being fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP).

 The reason for such a variety of transporters is unclear.

 In the muscle of obese persons with T2DM the speed of fatty acid transport is increased in comparison with lean or overweight persons.

 They found that this was associated with an increase in the membrane content of the fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36, but not FABPpm.

 The increased fatty acid uptake contributes to the excess accumulation of triglycerides in the cytoplasm due to an increase in esterification, with no alterations in the rates of oxidation.

 These proteins are highly regulated in all tissues by hormones (insulin and leptin) and transcription factors.

 The adipocyte concentration of FABP in serum correlates with the components of the metabolic syndrome and may be a prognostic indicator of the efficacy of a weight loss intervention.

 The fatty acids present in the blood must cross the endothelium to reach the tissues where they are metabolized.

 The vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) plays an important role in this process.

 Knock-out mice for VEGF-B have a lower uptake and accumulation of fatty acids in muscle, cardiac and brown adipose tissues but they accumulate more lipids in white adipose tissue.

 The process is mediated by the receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1) and neuropilin-1 expressed by the endothelium.

 The lower accumulation of lipids in myocytes has been related with their greater insulin sensitivity.

 Thus, a low VEGF-B activity reduces the intramyocellular lipids and improves insulin sensitivity, as the tissue tends to take up more glucose to obtain the sufficient energy for its purpose, diverting the fatty acids to the adipose tissue.

 The participation of VEGF-B in lipid uptake opens up the possibility of new strategies to modulate the pathological accumulation of lipids that is produced in diabetes, obesity or cardiovascular diseases.

 No studies have yet related the genetic variability of VEGF-B with alterations in glucose homeostasis.

 In addition, the risk value in a prospective study of the genetic variants of the transporters or their regulatory proteins, very particularly VEGF-B, is still an unexplored aspect.

 The di@bet.

es study.

 This is the first national study in Spain designed with the objective of determining the prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus.

 The team requesting this project is part of the Steering Committee of the di@bet.

es study.

 The results of the cross-sectional study were recently published.

 The study has collected numerous anthropometric, biochemical and lifestyle (exercise and diet) variables that will allow detailed analysis of factors associated with the prevalence of diabetes in this population (13 articles have been published so far).

 The DNA samples collected, together with the phenotype information obtained, will enable us to examine the associations mentioned above between the genetics of fatty acid transporters, the regulatory mechanisms, and the relation (cross and longitudinal) with diabetic phenotypes, among others, and their interactions with nutritional factors.

 The fact that this is a Spanish population based cohort study makes it an extremely useful test bench to examine the gene-gene and gene-nutrient interactions in the explanation of the incidence of diabetes.

 2.

 Hypothesis and Objectives General hypothesis: In a state of excess intake, the genetic variants of VEGF-B that induce low tissue VEGF-B activity could protect from diabetes (and the metabolic syndrome) whilst the adipose tissue accommodates the excess energy, whereas persons with a high activity quickly develop insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, due to the lipotoxicity produced by the excess of fatty acids introduced into the tissues.

 Specific hypotheses: 1.

 The genetic variants of the fatty acid transporters and their regulatory proteins (VEGF-B) are related with the risk of diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome and affect the onset of T2DM.

 2.

 Various gene-nutrient interactions exist in the explanation of factors affecting the development of diabetes.

 Objectives A.

 To determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Spain B.

 To show that the presence of particular alleles of genes encoding fatty acid transporters and their regulatory proteins (VEGF-B): 1.

 are associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or other carbohydrate metabolism disorders after four years of follow up.

 2.

 are associated with the risk of becoming obese, or having hypertension or the metabolic syndrome after four years of follow up.

 C.

 To demonstrate gene-gene and gene-nutrient interactions.

3- Defining the population at risk: The study is based on the di@bet.

es study, a cross-sectional study undertaken from 2007-2010 from a random cluster sampling in the Spanish population over 18 years of age.

 DNA samples are available in the Biobank CIBERDEM.

 Exclusion criteria: subjects with diabetes in cross-sectional study, serious illness, pregnancy, surgery within the previous month, or any other disabling situation that prevents participation will be excluded from the study.

 The investigators have data on 5072 people.

 Of these, about 4400 were free of diabetes in the cross-sectional study.

 Follow-up losses could be about 25% (known from previous studies).

 The expected final sample will comprise 3300 persons.

4- Identification of the exposure factors: Primary exposure factors: - Subjects will be classified according to their blood glucose as having a normal OGTT (unexposed subjects) or having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (exposed subjects).

 - Insulin Resistance Homeostasis Model Assessment quartiles, calculated from prior knowledge of the distribution of the variable IR-HOMA in the entire study population.

 - The genotypes of the genes involved in fatty acid transport.

 About 160 SNPs from the following genes: VEGF-B, FLT1 (VEGF-B receptor), neuropilin (VEGF-B receptor), CD36, FABP1, FABP1, FABP4, FABP6, FATP1, FATP2, FATP3, FATP4, FATP5 and FATP6.

4-Statistical analysis: At present, all the information from the cross-sectional study is computerized in databases specially designed for this project.

 At the end of the follow-up five groups of variables will be obtained: In databases: 1.

 Cross sectional clinical and anthropometric variables 2.

 Cross sectional nutritional and physical activity data 3.

 Cross sectional biochemical variables To be determined in this project: 4.

 Follow up clinical variables.

 5.

 Genetic variables: population frequencies of SNPs of the selected genes.

 Will be calculate: Estimation of the prevalence of different genotypes.

 Estimation of the global incidence of type 2 diabetes and related diseases in the population.

 Estimation of the incidence of diabetes and related diseases according to baseline clinical phenotypes and genotypes of the genes studied.

 Calculation of relative risks using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders.

 Calculation of gene-gene and gene-diet interaction, building interaction terms in the logistic regression analysis.

 Likewise, the attributable risk will be calculated (incidence of diabetes that is attributable to the exposure), population attributable risk (incidence of diabetes in the population associated with the exposure factor) and population attributable fraction (fraction of disease in a population attributable to exposure to a risk factor).

 Finally, to define which set of variables predict the risk, a strategy will be designed to carry out a principal component analysis.

 Analysis will be made using the R statistical package.

 4-Limitations Being a population study, certain groups tend to participate more likely than others (bias in participation), it will be compensate working also on weekends and holidays to prevent working people participate less.

 The study will diagnose diabetes based on a single OGTT, when the right thing would be to repeat the test at different times for confirmation.

 The logistical difficulties of this approach are hard to overcome, but the diagnoses were confirmed by simultaneous measurement of HbA1c.
