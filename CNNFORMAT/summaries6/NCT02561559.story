(secondQuint)SBRT Treatment for Lung Metastasis From Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

 The investigators started to treat PM oligometastatic patients with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.

 The investigators objective is to evaluate rate of local control of treated lesions in patients treated with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for lung metastases from soft-tissue sarcomas.

 Overall and disease free survival will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.

 SBRT Treatment for Lung Metastasis From Soft Tissue Sarcoma@highlight

In this study the investigators treat PM oligometastatic patients with SBRT.

 Our objective is to evaluate rate of local control of treated lesions in patients treated with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for lung metastases from STS.
