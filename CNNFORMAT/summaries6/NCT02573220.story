(fifthQuint)Irinotecan Hydrochloride With FOLFIRI and Cetuximab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With RAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the phase II recommended dosage of irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) administered in the FOLFIRI regimen plus cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28 uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) genotype treated as first line chemotherapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To estimate the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and metastasectomy (with curative intent) rate in the overall patient population (both genotype cohorts).

 OTHER OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the variability of irinotecan pharmacokinetics, in combination with cetuximab, in patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotype and the effect of the pharmacokinetic profile on toxicity and response rate.

 II.

 To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of irinotecan and its major metabolites in the absence and the presence of cetuximab administration, in order to define the effect of the chimeric monoclonal antibody on irinotecan pharmacokinetics.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with UGT1A1.

 Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1 and 15.

 Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 15 of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of all subsequent courses.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Irinotecan Hydrochloride With FOLFIRI and Cetuximab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With RAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer@highlight

This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of irinotecan hydrochloride, based on a genetic test, when given in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and cetuximab as first-line therapy in treating patients with an abnormal gene called RAS wild-type that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).

 Patients may also have a gene called uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) that may interfere with the way irinotecan hydrochloride is absorbed by the body and may not be able to tolerate it.

 Determining the presence of this gene may help determine the best dose of irinotecan hydrochloride when given with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium (FOLFIRI).

 Combination chemotherapy, such as FOLFIRI, works in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Cetuximab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Giving FOLFIRI together with cetuximab may be a better treatment for patients with colorectal cancer.
