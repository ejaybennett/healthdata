(secondQuint)BOLD MRI as a Surrogate of Improved Muscle Oxygenation Following Endovascular Therapy for the Treatment of CLI.

 This study is a prospective single arm, open label registry to evaluate the feasibility of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of a potentially new functional surrogate of altered lower limb skeletal muscle oxygenation after a successful percutaneous endovascular intervention.

 Baseline MRI assessment using the BOLD technique will be performed on qualified subjects prior to undergoing a standard of care endovascular therapy.

 Post-procedure BOLD-MRI assessment will also be performed at 30 days and either 90 or 180 days post-procedure.

 Post-MR image acquisition processing and analysis will be performed, using pre-determined algorithms, by a core laboratory.

 BOLD MRI as a Surrogate of Improved Muscle Oxygenation Following Endovascular Therapy for the Treatment of CLI@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if an MRI technique called Blood Oxygen Level Dependent, or BOLD, can be used to evaluate blood flow in the leg before and after treatment with standard endovascular therapy in patients with chronic lower limb ischemia.
