(secondQuint)The Acceptability of the HPV Vaccine Postpartum and With Pediatric Well-child Visits: A Pilot Study.

 There are a large number of young adult women who have not received any doses of HPV vaccine or are incompletely vaccinated.

 Recommendation for HPV vaccine could occur during pregnancy with the administration of the vaccine postpartum.

 Finding a way to make it easy for women to present for vaccination is imperative as this is currently a 3-vaccine series.

 The investigators are interested in understanding if women would find it acceptable if the investigators discussed and encouraged the vaccine while pregnant with receipt of the vaccine through their child's pediatrician at well-child visits in the postpartum period.

 The investigators will survey women in the third trimester of pregnancy to determine if they would find this acceptable and follow-up with them after their child's two month pediatric visit to reevaluate their opinion.

 No doses of the vaccine will be given.

 The investigators are also interested in understanding other factors that could affect whether or not women would be interested in receiving the HPV vaccine postpartum.

 This includes rates of attendance at postpartum visits as well as behavioral, knowledge and demographic characteristics that may be associated with acceptability of receiving the vaccine.
