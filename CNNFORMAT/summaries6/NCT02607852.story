(secondQuint)Feedback System of PROMS in Children With Burns.

 The primary objective of this pilot study is to ascertain the feasibility and usefulness of a feedback system that provides clinicians with parent-proxy reported outcomes measure data during routine outpatient encounters for burn treatment.

 The secondary objective of this first phase of the study is to determine clinicians' and parents perception of the experience of completing the BOQ+P and/or the usefulness of the information that was provided to the clinician and parent/guardians(s).

 For this reason we will collect a brief debriefing questionnaire from physicians and another from parents.
