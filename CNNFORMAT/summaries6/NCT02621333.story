(firstQuint)Chemotherapy Combined Autologous Cytokine-induced Killer Cells in Naive Stage IV EGFR-wild Type Lung Adenocarcinoma.

 There is still no great improvement in advanced EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma although great progress was made in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

 It's necessary to explore the treatment mode of this kind of patients.

 As the progress was made in tumor immunity and immunotherapy, more and more cancer therapists accept the treatment model of chemotherapy combined immunotherapy.

 And now chemotherapy combined autologous CIK cells is one kind of common treatment model in some countries.

 Investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this kind of treatment model in patients with stage IV naive EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma.
