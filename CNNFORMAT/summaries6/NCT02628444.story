(fifthQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety of 3-Dose and Booster Dose of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Subjects 9 to 50 Years of Age.

 Healthy subjects between age 9 and 50 year will receive in various schedules of CYD vaccine and placebo administration over a 12-month period.

 They will be further randomized to receive a single booster vaccination of CYD vaccine at either 12 months or 24 months following the last primary series injection.

 Immunogenicity and Safety of 3-Dose and Booster Dose of Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Subjects 9 to 50 Years of Age@highlight

The aim of the study is to assess the safety of the primary series vaccine schedules and the booster vaccination Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

 - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post final vaccination.

 - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD vaccine Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

 - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

 - To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days post Dose 3 to the Ab levels immediately before receiving booster injection in all 3 CYD vaccination groups.

 - To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days post-dose 2 and 28 days post-dose 3 from CYD Dengue vaccine group in a primary series schedule.

 - To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD vaccine.

 - To evaluate the safety profile of CYD vaccine after each and any injection
