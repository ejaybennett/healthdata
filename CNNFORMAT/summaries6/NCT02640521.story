(fifthQuint)Smoking Cessation Peds Asthma.

 Investigators will adapt guideline-based interventions used in adult medicine.

 The intervention consists of two system-level interventions (chart reminders to prompt providers to ask about in-home smoking and a State Quit-line referral system), and a provider-level intervention (training in the PHS Guidelines, in motivational interviewing, and on how to use the system-level intervention).

 Investigators will implement the study in the Bellevue Pediatric Asthma Clinic and the pediatric clinic at Lincoln Hospital using a two group (pre intervention control group / post-intervention treatment group) pilot study to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a multi-level (i.

e.

, system and provider) intervention.

 The primary outcome is provider adherence to tobacco use treatment guidelines, which will be assessed by conducting parent exit interviews with 200 smoking parents (100 pre-intervention [control group] and 100 post-intervention [treatment group]).

 Preliminary intervention outcomes will be collected through the parent exit interviews (i.

e.

, baseline) and 2-month post-baseline interviews with the control and treatment parents.

 Providers will also be interviewed regarding their satisfaction with the intervention.

 Smoking Cessation Peds Asthma@highlight

The overall goal of this study is to adapt and preliminarily validate an intervention based on evidence based approaches to assist smoking parents and other family members of inner-city children ages 4 to 12 with asthma to stop smoking.

This study aims (1) to adapt existing guideline-based materials used in adult medicine to create a system- and provider-level intervention for pediatrics and (2) to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of (a) procedures to recruit inner-city, ethnic minority parents and (b) intervention procedures, and to estimate intervention effects.
