(secondQuint)Patient Education for Patients With Back Pain Referred to Physical Therapy.

 The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of a patient education session provided prior to beginning physical therapy on outcomes of usual physical therapy for acute/sub-acute low back pain patients.

 The study compares two groups, one group will be treated with usual physical therapy with no pre-treatment education and the other group will also receive the pre-treatment.

 Patients will be followed after 6 weeks and 3 months.

 Physical therapy care is left to the discretion of the physical therapist in conjunction with the patient.

 Outcomes will include pain and disability, and patients attitude and believes (pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance behavior).

 The overall hypothesis is that the additional educational treatment may address and improve pain, disability and fear.
