(fifthQuint)Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Long-term Dizziness in Primary Care.

 Dizziness is a common complaint.

 International studies show a prevalence of balance/dizziness problems in 10-30% in the population, and in Norway it is reported that 11 % of the population have symptoms of dizziness and/or imbalance during the last three months.

 Peripheral vestibular disorders are the most common cause of dizziness presenting in primary care.

 Most people recover within a few weeks , but it is assumed that about 30% of the patients do not recover fully from an acute peripheral vestibular disorder and develop long-lasting dizziness, often with secondary musculoskeletal pain and anxiety, making it a multifactorial syndrome.

 It is unknown if these secondary complaints are issues that maintain or exacerbates the dizziness, or if a high level of musculoskeletal and psychological problems may predict future disability.

There is a general consensus that exercises labeled as Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) is the most effective treatment for vestibular dysfunction.

 VR exercises involve eye, head and body movements aiming to provoke dizziness, which is a prerequisite for adaptation and recovery.

 However, not all patients will recover from VR, and therefore increased attention toward the psychological aspects, targeting how patients think about the dizziness has been addressed.

 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone or in addition to VR seems to have limited effect.

 This present study aims to combine an existing group treatment targeting body awareness and VR with CBT in order to address both the movement provoked dizziness and secondary complaints that patients with long-term dizziness often present with.

 Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Long-term Dizziness in Primary Care@highlight

Brief Summary: The purpose of the present study is to examine the effects of a Group based intervention consisting of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with long--lasting vestibular dizziness.

 The study also aims to describe sociodemographic, physical and psychological characteristics in the patients, and to examine prognostic factors related to functional status and disability following participation in the intervention.
