(fifthQuint)Prospective Study to Evaluate Safety of Deb-TACE With 100 Beads in Patients With Non Resectable HCC.

 In this observational, prospective study patients will undergo DEB-TACE and subsequent follow up procedures according to standard clinical practice.

 The primary aim of the study is to describe treatment safety and tolerability of 100 mu beads in DEB-TACE.

 As a secondary end-point a description of efficacy parameters will be obtained.

 Prospective Study to Evaluate Safety of Deb-TACE With 100 Beads in Patients With Non Resectable HCC@highlight

This is an observational, multicenter, single arm, prospective study to evaluate safety and tolerability of selective and ultraselective drug eluting beads transcatheter intraarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with up to 3 ml of well calibrated 100 mu microspheres and up to 150 mg of doxorubicin, for the treatment of non resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

 The hypothesis is that 100 mu beads penetrate deeper into the tumor than those eluting beads with larger volumes without increasing the risk and complications of DEB-TACE.
