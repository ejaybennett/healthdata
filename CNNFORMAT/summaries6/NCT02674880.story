(firstQuint)Hyaluronic Acid in Acute Exacerbation of COPD - Duration Of Noninvasive Assistance.

 The objective of this study is to test the effect of HMW-HA on NIV effectiveness in patients admitted to a sub-intensive care unit for respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of COPD.

 The design is a parallel-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

 Eighty patients, aged eighteen years or older, admitted for respiratory failure primarily due to COPD exacerbation and requiring non-invasive ventilation will be enrolled and randomized to the study treatment (active or placebo).

 All patients will be treated with NIV delivered using a Hamilton C1 ventilator and medical therapy according to current guidelines (inhaled long-acting b2 agonists, inhaled long-acting anticholinergic, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics).

 Patients randomized to the active intervention group will also receive HMW-HA (Yabro(R) - 5 ml of saline containing 0.

3% hyaluronic acid sodium salt) via nebulizer b.

, while patients randomized in the control group will receive a matching placebo.

 Patients will be treated until weaning or until NIV failure, defined as oro-tracheal intubation or death.
