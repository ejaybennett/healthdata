(firstQuint)Understanding and Improving Quality of Life Through a Wireless Activity Tracker: Observational Phase.

 This project proposes the investigation, validation, and use of a wireless activity tracker to better understand and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from brain tumors.

 The Fitbit flex wireless syncing activity tracker will be distributed to 75 patients, and the electronic infrastructure to automatically track patients will be created and adapted for the cohort.

 Surveys will routinely assess the ease-of-use and any problems arising.

 This heterogenous population of patients suffering from brain tumors will be tracked and compared through routine evaluation of their quality of life through well-established surveys, including the SF-36 and FACT-Br.

 The association between data recorded from the activity tracker and the QOL surveys will be quantified to validate the activity tracking data as a surrogate measure of part, if not all, of QOL as well as sleep.

This project attempts to correlate wireless activity data with quality of life and sleep surveys in order to find a new method of monitoring patients during their treatment.
