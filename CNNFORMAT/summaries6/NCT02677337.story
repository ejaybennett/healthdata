 The initial retrospective cohort will serve as the pre-education control, and the second cohort will be the experimental group to assess the efficacy of the educational intervention to change care of patients with mRCC.

 Chart Reviews.

 This study will begin with a multi-site chart review conducted at the Duke Cancer Network affiliated sites.

 The chart review will begin in late fall, 2015.

 The Duke Cancer Network team will perform chart abstraction for this study, with a goal of reviewing at least 60 charts of patients treated between July 2013 and October 2015.

 The second data collection period will collect data on patients with mRCC seen at DCN sites after the date in fall 2015 when the educational intervention is rolled out.

 The target will again be at least 60 charts of patients treated during the time the educational intervention is actively available.
