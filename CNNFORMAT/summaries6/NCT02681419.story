(firstQuint)Evaluating the Efficacy of Fenestrations in Tube Shunt Implants During the Early Postoperative Period.

 This is a prospective, randomized control study of glaucomatous eye undergoing tube shunt implantation using a nonvalved implant for poorly controlled glaucoma of any type.

 Eyes scheduled to receive a nonvalved tube shunt implant will be randomized to receive either needle fenestration(s) or a suture wick using a single 10-0 vicryl anterior to the ligature.

 The operative quadrant will be imaged using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography at pre- and post-operative visits.

This study evaluates two different methods of controlling intraocular pressure in nonvalved aqueous tube shunts immediately after implantation; needle fenestrations or a suture wick.
