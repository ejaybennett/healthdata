(secondQuint)Effect of Ca2+ Ionophore on Embryonic Development and Clinical Outcome in Cases With Previous Fertilization Arrest.

 Many studies reported that Ca2+ ionophore has a positive effect on embryo development in cases with complete or partial fertilization failure.

 However, only one preliminary report suggested a beneficial effect of Ca2+ ionophore activation in four cases with fertilization arrest.

 Effect of Ca2+ Ionophore on Embryonic Development and Clinical Outcome in Cases With Previous Fertilization Arrest@highlight

We aimed to investigate the efficiency of chemical oocyte activation using readymade Ca2+ ionophore on cases with previously cancelled cases due to fertilization arrest at pronuclear stage i.

e: cleavage failure to find out if there is any improvement in embryonic developmental stages.
