(thirdQuint)Multimodal Monitoring of Fetal Risk of Inflammation in Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes.

 Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is one of the leading causes for preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcome.

 Between 24 0/7 and 34 0/7 weeks of gestation the prolongation of pregnancy is the recommended course of action to reduce the risks of prematurity in most countries.

 An intra-amniotic infection resulting in fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) or early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is often associated with high morbidity and mortality.

 Standard monitoring includes the maternal response to inflammation (i.

e.

 maternal serum parameters) as well as fetal signs of acute FIRS (i.

e.

 fetal tachycardia, high cytokine level in amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis).

 Changes of fetal ECG-parameters are also a sign of an acute FIRS.

 Currently, there is no adequate parameter for the surveillance of a possible ongoing intra-amniotic infection.

 Other studies have reported a correlation between vaginal fluid interleukine 6 (IL6) collected noninvasively and the risk of FIRS and EOS.

 Information obtained by computerized fetal ECG analysis might be suitable to detect early signs of fetal infection before the manifestation of FIRS.

 With the implementation of a vaginal fluid collector it is possible to detect the vaginal fluid cytokine in clinical everyday routine.

 With the improvement of fetal ECG monitoring it is possible to record the fetal ECG daily.

 This study examines the correlation between these new parameters and the onset of fetal infection before the manifestation of a severe systemic fetal inflammation.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the value of vaginal fluid cytokine levels as well as computerized fetal ECG analysis are suitable clinical parameters to detect an imminent intra-amniotic inflammation with a high risk of fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) or a neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) and whether these parameters can be determined on a daily basis in the clinical monitoring of pregnancies complicated by PPROM.
