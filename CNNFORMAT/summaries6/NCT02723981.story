(fifthQuint)COMBO-Stent in Patients on Chronic Anticoagulant Therapy (COSTA) COSTA-Bleed and COSTA-Outcome Trials.

 The COSTA trials are investigator-initiated studies aimed at comparing the clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a COMBO-stent based strategy associated with short-term antiplatelet therapy with a guidelines-based therapy in patients with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation.

 The study is organized as a national, multi-centre prospective, randomized trial.

 The duration of the follow-up is 15 months.

 COMBO-Stent in Patients on Chronic Anticoagulant Therapy (COSTA) COSTA-Bleed and COSTA-Outcome Trials@highlight

Prospective, multi-centre, randomized, open-label, parallel comparisons to evaluate - the incidence of bleedings (COSTA-Bleed) and - the incidence of ischemic and bleeding events (COSTA-Outcome) following a therapy with the abluminal sirolimus coated bio-engineered stent (COMBO stent) in association with short-term single antiplatelet therapy as compared to a guidelines-based strategy in patients with coronary artery disease with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulant therapy.
