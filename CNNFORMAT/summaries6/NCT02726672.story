(firstQuint)Fatigue and Inspiratory Muscles Training in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.

 Patients will be informed about the study procedures during a follow-up consultation or an hospitalization in a Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Unit.

 If they give their informed consent to participate in the study, an investigator will randomize them into one of the 2 arms of the study.

 This study consists of 3 visits.

 The first visit (inclusion) is planned at day 0, the second visit 10 weeks later and the third 3 months after day 0.

 A patient who is randomized in the experimental arm will have to follow 10 weeks of rehabilitation of the inspiratory muscles at home between first and second visit.

 During this period, investigators will call these patients once a week to assess the compliance with the rehabilitation.

 The patients who have been randomized in the control group will not follow this rehabilitation program.
