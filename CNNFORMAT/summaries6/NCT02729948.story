(fifthQuint)Tethered Capsule Endoscope in Screening Patients With Barrett Esophagus.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate image quality and usability of the tethered capsule endoscope after repeated clinical use and reprocessing.

 II.

 Evaluate safety issues associated with the use of the device for this subject population - was there any noticeable difference from prior study of subjects at high risk of Barrett's esophagus using the same device, but without reprocessing.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES; I.

 Study other specified device characteristics or device application considerations.

 II.

 Obtain preliminary data for use in designing a subsequent pivotal study of the device.

 OUTLINE: Patients swallow the tethered capsule endoscope (TCE) and undergo endoscopic examination while they are seated on a standard endoscopy gurney.

 Patients undergo standard of care EGD on the same day.

 Tethered Capsule Endoscope in Screening Patients With Barrett Esophagus@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies how well tethered capsule endoscope works in screening patients with Barrett esophagus (BE), a condition where the lining of the esophagus has changed or has been replaced with abnormal cells that may lead to cancer also called esophageal cancer.

 In an attempt to prevent the progression from BE to esophageal cancer, patients undergo a standard procedure called esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) where patients are sedated and the doctor uses an endoscope to examine the tissue in the esophagus.

 Tethered capsule endoscope is a tiny capsule with a laser scan inside and a very thin cord attached to it.

 Patients swallow the capsule and the thin cord keeps the capsule in specific area in the esophagus.

 After pictures of the lining of esophagus are taken, the capsule is removed using the thin cord.

 Tethered capsule endoscope may be able to identify tissue changes in patients with BE without the need for sedation or anesthesia, thus eliminating the associated risks and costs associated with EGD.
