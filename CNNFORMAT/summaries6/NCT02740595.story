(firstQuint)E-cigarettes and Blood Vessel Function.

 Participants will use an electronic cigarette on 3 occasions: 1) with nicotine, 2) without nicotine, 3) sham control, and undergo a measure of endothelial function called brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD).

 Additionally, oxidative stress will be measured pre and post exposure.
