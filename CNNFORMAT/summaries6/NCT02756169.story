(fifthQuint)Maternal Obesity and Breastfeeding Performance.

 BACKGROUND Maternal obesity alters the composition of the breast milk beyond the influence of diet on it: lower concentrations of polyamines, an altered pattern of saturated and trans- fatty acids, and reduced mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

 In addition, altered bioactive components are also observed such as regulatory factors and growth hormones, regulatory metabolic adiponectin, immunologic factors, cytokines, among others.

 There is a relationship between indicators of infant growth and body composition; as in the case of leptin that concentrates more on women with obesity.

 There has been found that those breastfed infants of obese women have a greater weight gain than breastfed infants of normal weight women.

 Biological factors are: breastfeeding is a bit delayed in primiparous women and more in mothers with obesity.

 Obesity delays copious production of breast milk (Lactogenesis stage II) and it concurs with the synthesis of prolactin (PRL), in response to the decreased sucking of the child.

 In addition to this attenuated neurological response, a low chronic inflammation level (particular of obesity) and with the production of cytokines by the proinflammatory adipose tissue there is zinc sequestration at the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes of epithelial cells of mammary gland, activating the process of premature recession, compromising the establishment of the copious milk production and causing premature weaning.

 Another biological alterations that mothers with obesity suffer are that they have an altered glucose management, which compromises their milk production.

 In addition to these biological alterations,obese mothers have a higher risk of complications in the delivery; where it is common to experience great physiological stress and having a high probability of caesarean, which metabolically does not interfere with breastfeeding but delays its establishment.

 Physical factors such as an excess of subcutaneous fat in the area of the areola of mothers with obesity cause discomfort and stress in the mother and crying in the infant, hindering the correct latch of the infant to the nipple, weakening the neurological stimulus that triggers Prolactin production.

 In addition, psychosocial factors complicate breastfeeding in overweight women; obese mothers have reported an increased feeling of insufficient milk, compared with non-obese mothers.

 In addition to this, women with obesity report lower self-efficacy than their pairs without obesity.

 Despite the implementation of educational interventions to promote the establishment of breastfeeding in obese women, the results have not been favorable to increase the prevalence of breastfeeding.

 To help to improve this practice in women with obesity, it raises the following research question: An intervention specifically designed to lessen the problems in establishing breastfeeding in women with obesity, which includes: an educational intervention with support during the pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period and the first year of life; increases the frequency of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding during the first month of life, and the total duration of breastfeeding? METHODOLOGY PHASE 1 INTERVENTION DESIGN The intervention will be made with information derived from a focus group (FG).

 The main objective is to identify the barriers of a mother with obesity for breastfeeding (discomfort, delay in producing the milk copiously, flat nipple, among others) and to explore the ideas to overcome them.

 For this purpose, an FG will derive the elements to design a communication component according to real experiences to aim the problems for breastfeeding of obese women.

 The communication theory that will be used is Communication in Health as a strategy for structuring the activities.

 Investigators will develop a guide to lead the FG discussion that allows the investigators to identify the factors that influence the performance of breastfeeding in obese pregnant women.

 The main characteristic of women participating in the FG is pregnant women with obesity, the distinction between primiparous and not primiparous women and those who have breastfed before at least for 6 months.

 Validation of messages Investigators will perform a comparison of the messages derived from the analysis of the FG with the group of mothers who participated in the FG to ensure that the messages are relevant and clear.

 Workshop Design.

 With an expert on learning techniques as a collaborator, investigators will design the workshop with the validated messages derived from the FG and it will be complemented by using the experience of an IBCLC.

 The workshop will be divided into three stages: - First stage: Basics of breastfeeding and its significance for the health of the baby and mother.

 - Second stage: discussion of the problems that may arise, particularly in mothers with obesity.

 Recommendations and appropriate techniques to solve these problems will be given trough Games and communication activities will be driven.

 - Third stage: Treatment of the most common problems and the counseling for solving them.

 PHASE 2.

 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION.

 Step 1.

 Enrollment.

 This stage is scheduled to take place within 5 months and it has two strategies: 1) with previous authorization of the Health Ministry of Mexico City, investigators will request information from the censuses of each health jurisdiction where there are all the pregnant women identified, or; 2) investigators will approach to pregnant women at the time they attend to their medical consultation.

 Once investigators have identified the pregnant women,they will ask for the pregnant women informed consent (adult) / written assent (adolescent) to obtain information about them since the eligibility criteria will be evaluated.

 These criteria are: age 15 years old, presence of obesity (IMC >28 for adolescents and >29 for adults), weeks of gestation (between 22 and 33 w), absence of chronic illnesses contraindicated for breastfeeding (HIV or AIDS, hepatitis, etc.

, except diabetes), not consuming drugs contraindicated during lactation, and in case of multiple pregnancies, there will be considered only the eldest child of twins (if there are more than two babies the pregnant women will be excluded from the study), absence of breast reduction surgery, and they may continue be living in Mexico City after delivery.

 In this step, investigators estimate the necessity of screening approximately 3,700 women as potential participants.

 Once that the pregnant women who met the criteria has been identified, investigators will ask for another informed consent or written assent for explaining in detail the whole study, and invite them to participate.

 Also, sociodemographic data and a self-efficacy questionnaire (a questionnaire about the feeling of the participant to be capable of breastfed her baby) will be collected.

 The aim is to recruit 200 women.

 Then, investigators will assign randomly each one of the women to a study group (intervention group or control group).

 Step 2.

 Basal phase.

 Once women were assigned to a study group it is the beginning of the intervention and it is considered as the baseline of the study.

 Activities for Control group: The women who were assigned to this group will be monitored by telephone to ask about their breastfeeding performance.

 Investigators will call them once a month until the 6 months of age of their baby then, every two months until the childs first year old.

 Women assigned to this group will have the option (they will make the choice) to take the courses standardly organized by their health center.

 To encourage the pregnant to reach these courses, the staff of the educational programs in each health center invite physicians, nurses, and social workers; to let them know the existence of these groups and the importance of invite all pregnant women to take them.

 Also, these courses are promoted for the staff of each health center.

 Some of the topics in these courses are directed to the care of the mother and others on the newborn's care.

 At immediate postpartum: Investigators will identify the arrival of a woman of the study to any of the five hospitals selected for the study.

 For the women of the control group, investigators will only collect data of self-efficacy, birth and health conditions, both baby and mother after delivery.

 The intervention will be set at different times: 1.

 During pregnancy: with a workshop where there will be particularly designed to solve doubts about the problems of breastfeeding, and for showing the health benefits for the infant and mother health.

 The workshop will be based mainly on the material developed in the FC and with the assistance of an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) of Mexico.

 It will ensure to cover the educational material, communication and practical, recommended by the WHO Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative.

 For this group, there will be asked another self-efficacy questionnaire at the end of the workshop.

 2.

 At immediate postpartum: Investigators will identify the arrival of a woman of the study to any of the five hospitals selected for the study.

 For the intervention group, in addition to the collection of data of health conditions of the mother and her baby, one of the IBCLC will attend and provide immediate support for the establishment of breastfeeding within the first few hours old of the baby.

 The IBCLC may solve all doubts of the mothers; give support, supervise and guide the initiation of breastfeeding, explain the proper grip, suggest the ideal positions to breastfeeding for both the mother and the newborn, this support it is supposed to be intensive.

 All these activities must be coordinated with the physicians and nurses from each of the five hospitals in order to follow the rules and requirements that each hospital has established.

 3.

 After delivery and until the first year of life of the children: the intervention will consist of two steps.

 1.

 During the first 7 days of the life of the infant.

 An IBCLC will call the mother daily.

 2.

 A telephonic follow-up at 2 weeks old of the baby and then, a phone call each month until reaching 6 months; then, every two months until the baby will have one year of life.

 With the calls, investigators pretend to collect information about the duration and type of feeding.

 There is the possibility that the support will be held via "Skype" if the women prefer it.

 Investigators will deliver written relevant information about the recommended alimentation of the women at postpartum as well as some ideas for physical activity, such as going for a walk, doing some household chores that involve physical exertion.

 This technical information is derived from the literature and will be expressed in a simple and accessible way.

 Each issue will be sent separately, ie, will be three times for sending the information.

 For those women who leave the study before the first year of her child, investigators will send them the information at once.

 *Baseline measurements in women* Measurements shall be made in mothers in both control and intervention groups.

 Investigators will develop and pre-test quantitative instruments to measure the following variables: Self-efficacy and breastfeeding problems related to the infants and women.

 Sociodemographic characteristics: Through a questionnaire investigators will ask about household members, the household head, marital status and education of the participants, housing characteristics (number of rooms, flooring material and roof material) and possession of household goods ( TV, radio, computer, vehicle, etc.

).

 In addition, investigators will ask if the participant has a formal employment and if she receives a payment and the type of work performed.

 General characteristics of the infant: sex, gestational age at birth, and type of birth (birth or caesarean section).

 Infant anthropometry: During women's hospital stay, length and weight data will be measured to calculate Z-score of weight / age, length / age, weight / length indicators.

 Diagnosis of the infant: evaluations that are made to the newborn by protocol, these include Apgar score at one and five minutes, Silverman Andersen after 10 minutes and neonatal complications, and any clinical disease condition, which are obtained from the medical record or medical report.

 Initial food: the first time and elapsed time since the baby was born until was fed.

 PHASE 3.

 FOLLOW-UP At a month postpartum, investigators will visit participants at home, both the control group and the intervention group, for information on breastfeeding practices.

 Also from the mother, a breast milk sample will be taken to determine the composition of fatty acids of it, a blood sample to determine C-Reactive Protein and also investigators will collect dietary information.

 Then from the child measures on infant growth (weight, length, and skinfold thickness) will be taken.

 The project staff will be standardized for newborn anthropometric measurement, following the technique of Lohman.

 Measurements obtained from the mother: -Breastfeeding practices: Through a questionnaire she will be asked for the type of food the infant received.

 Investigators will ask for the time the infant received breastfeeding, exclusive or not.

 A sample of breast milk for determination of fatty acids and C-reactive protein in serum as a marker of inflammation will be determined.

 -Infant Measurements Infant growth: During the home visits, weight, length and head circumference of the infant measurements will be taken with the specified techniques above.

 In addition, skinfold (triceps, biceps, and subscapularis) shall be measured to calculate the indicators: triceps skinfold / age and subscapular skinfold / age and head circumference.

 For this measurements, the project staff will also be trained and standardized.

 Sample size and statistical power Investigators will study 200 obese pregnant women, 100 per study group.

 This sample size was calculated to detect a difference in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (at one month postpartum) in 10 percent (12 to 22%), with a statistical power of 90%, a level of significance >0.

05, a nonresponse rate of 50% and 15% of abandonment postpartum.

 To achieve the sample size, recruitment will be held for 5 months, hoping to incorporate to the study, at least, two women daily.

 This calculation was performed using information on the number of women who could meet the inclusion criteria of the study.

 To achieve this sample size, investigators estimated to screen a total of 3,700 women in the primary care level health services in order to identify women who meet the inclusion criteria as described above.

 According to similar studies, to calculate the number of women needed to get 200 women (100 in each group) investigators did as it follows: All pregnant women attending health centers n= 3,700 It is expected that at least 34% of women have a body mass index (BMI)> 29 n= 1,258 It is expected that 40% meet inclusion criteria n= 503 Only 50% agree to participate n= 251 Approximately 80% give birth in the reference hospital n= 200 Data management Study participants will be assigned a unique identification number.

 A subject identification list will be created, including the subjects identification number, personal information and contact information of each subject participating in the study.

 Only the main investigator will have access to this list in order to make it possible to trace and identify an individual subject.

 This list will also help to carry out medical auditing.

 For all the analysis and data management, the identification number will be used in order to ensure confidentiality and privacy of the subjects.

 Once data is collected by fieldworkers, the completed questionnaires will be brought to the headquarters of the study, where supervisors will check for potential mistakes or missing information.

 Investigators will use a case report form per participant, where a checklist of all information to be collected from them and the quality of it, will be recorded.

 The case report form will be filled out by the field supervisor every time is checking the file of each subject.

 The purpose of the case report form will be for monitoring the quality of the information collected, and to check that all the information is being collected on time.

 Data entry will be performed continuously during the course of the study.

 Data will be entered in duplicate for quality control.

 In case there are missing data or errors in data collection, the field workers will go back to participants and recover the information when possible.

 Regular backup of databases procedures will be conducted.

 Statistical processing and analysis STATA version 13.

1 is the statistical package that will be used to process information to describe the study population characteristics, making tests of the results between the two groups, explore the trends and to obtain the average length of BF by intervention group.

 Evaluate the change in measurements of growth of infants from birth to 12 months of life.

 Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics (summary measures, according to variable type and measurement scale) will be a descriptive analysis including means, medians, standard errors and variances for each of the stages of data collection (baseline and follow-up), as applicable.

 To analyze baseline differences between the study groups, comparisons between groups will be made by the difference of proportions test for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables.

 The statistics tests will include design information, adjusting the standard errors and applying a continuity correction.

 For the analysis of sociodemographic information, a cluster analysis will be used to identify groups of interest considering some characteristics of women.

 Analytical or inferential statistics (test to be applied by type of variable: if necessary, statistical hypotheses and test procedures).

 To evaluate the effect of the intervention data will be analyzed as panel data comparisons of means and variances.

 ANOVA, ANCOVA MANOVA and for comparing the groups: analysis of variance with and without intervention between and within groups.

 To evaluate the relationship between obesity and breastfeeding performance investigators will use regression models were conducted and sociodemographic and anthropometric of each of the participants and their children will be included.

 On the other hand, regression models will be conducted to analyze the relationship between the composition of breast milk and the infant's growth at one month and at 12 months.

 All the analysis will be done with intent to treatment.

 Qualitative analysis For the analysis of the educational intervention, qualitative analysis will be carried out through satisfaction surveys and open-ended questionnaires.

 Maternal Obesity and Breastfeeding Performance@highlight

Investigators propose this study in order to answer the following research question: An educational intervention and breastfeeding support at postpartum will increase the frequency and total breastfeeding duration in the intervention group? This is a randomized (with control and intervention groups) study, open and parallel (1: 1 ratio between study groups) with 200 pregnant women in the second or third trimester, according to their body mass index (BMI, kg / m2) with excess weight (BMI> 29 pre-pregnancy weight) and that will address their pregnancy in the public health services and hospitals belonging to the Health Ministry of 5 districts: Coyoacan, Magdalena Contreras, Tlalpan, Xochimilco and Alvaro Obregon in Mexico City.

 The intervention group and the control group will have the same characteristics for eligibility.

 The main phases to develop the study are PHASE 1.

 INTERVENTION DESIGN PHASE 2.

 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION.

 PHASE 3.

 FOLLOW-UP The intervention will be offered at 3 times: 1) Educational intervention (a workshop) to pregnant obese women.

 The workshop will be held by an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) to promote exclusive breastfeeding and to encourage a better breastfeeding performance in accordance with the WHO recommendations.

 The workshop will be held at convenient times and will be conducted for groups of 8 to 10 participants; 2) Immediate breastfeeding support at hospital by an IBCLC and; 3) The women will be exposed to early telephonic follow-up during the first week of their childrens life and each month until six months of life.

 Then, if the breastfeeding continues, each two months until the first year of their childrens life.

 At the first month postpartum, investigators will visit participants at home, both the control group and the intervention group, for collecting information on breastfeeding practices, for taking a breast milk sample to estimate its fatty acids content, and a blood sample (serum) to obtain the C-Reactive Protein.

 Also, the investigators will take anthropometric measurements of the children to evaluate their growth (weight, length, and skinfold thickness).

 Investigators will ask for breastfeeding practices and diet of the participants through a 24 hours recall.

 The results of this intervention group will be compared with the control group: pregnant obese women without the educational intervention or telephonic follow-up.
