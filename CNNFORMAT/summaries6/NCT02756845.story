(firstQuint)Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec In Children With Advanced Non CNS Tumors.

 This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical setting.

 Approximately 18 treated pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled into 2 cohorts stratified by age (permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, a minimum of 6 subjects/cohort and a minimum of 18 subjects total).

 DLT will be evaluated based on 6 to 12 DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort.

 The DLT evaluation period is 35 days from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec.
