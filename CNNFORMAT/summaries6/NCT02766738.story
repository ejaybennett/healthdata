(thirdQuint)Improving Mobility in Residential Aged Care.

 This study will employ a non-randomised controlled design in which three different 24-week exercise programs and a non-exercising control group will be compared in the residential aged care (RAC) setting.

 The three programs are the GrACE and the GrACE plus a gait specific training program.

 Data Collection ~40 participants from two RAC facilities will be recruited into the study.

 This number of participants will provide 80% statistical power to identify moderate effect size between group differences on the primary outcome measures.

 The control group will be drawn from each of the RAC facility approached receiving exercise treatment.

 Participation will be informed by a discussion with the facilities Service Manager about the eligibility of participants and a medical history screen undertaken.

 All participants will provide informed written consent prior to participation.

 Participants in the exercise group will perform twice weekly training for 24 weeks.

 Data will be collected at 0 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks in the control and exercise groups.
