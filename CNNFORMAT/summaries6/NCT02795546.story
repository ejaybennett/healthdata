(firstQuint)Effect of Alendronate With  - TCP Bone Substitute in Surgical Therapy of Periodontal Intra-osseous Defects.

.

 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bone formation potential of 400 mu g alendronate(ALN) delivered in -TCP in the treatment of periodontal intra-osseous defects.

 Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with periodontal defects were randomly assigned to 400 mu g ALN + -TCP + saline (test) group and -TCP + saline (active-control) group.

 Clinical parameters like clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, probing depth (PD) reduction, post-operative gingival recession (GR) were assessed from the baseline, 3 months and 6 months recordings.

 Radiographic parameters like linear bone growth (LBG), percentage bone fill (%BF), change in alveolar crest height (ACH) were assessed from baseline and 6 months radiographs.
