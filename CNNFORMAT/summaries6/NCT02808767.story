(firstQuint)Comparison of Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in the Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction.

 Study objectives: 1.

 Compare the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in acute myocardial infarction treated with emergent PCI.

 2.

 Assess the safety of switching to clopidogrel after remission of the acute phase of MI in patients for whom economic barriers do not allow to continue treatment with prasugrel or ticagrelor.

 All randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction have been treated with standard therapeutic procedures in accordance with the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
