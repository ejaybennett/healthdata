(thirdQuint)The Efficacy of a New Mathematical Formula to Predict Continuous Positive Air Pressure With an Oronasal Mask Interface.

.

 The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of an algorithm we previously created to adjust Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) when a mask interface is switched from a nasal to a full face.

 Subjects will currently have a moderate to severe Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI - The Apnea-Hypopnea Index or Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea.

 It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep).

 (above 15) - Scoring of apneas Score a respiratory event as an apnea when BOTH of the following criteria are met: N1, N2, N3, N4 1.

 There is a drop in the peak signal excursion by 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study) or an alternative apnea sensor (diagnostic study) 2.

 The duration of the 90% drop in sensor signal is 10 seconds.

 Score an apnea as obstructive if it meets apnea criteria and is associated with absent inspiratory effort throughout the entire period of absent airflow.

 Score an apnea as central if it meets apnea criteria and is associated with absent inspiratory effort throughout the entire period of absent airflow.

 Score an apnea as mixed if it meets apnea criteria and is associated with absent inspiratory effort in the initial portion of the event, followed by resumption of inspiratory effort in the second portion of the event.

 N4 Note 1 - Identification of an apnea does not require a minimum desaturation criterion.

 Note 2 - If a portion of a respiratory event that would otherwise meet criteria for a hypopnea meets criteria for apnea, the entire event should be scored an apnea.

 Note 3 - If the apnea or hypopnea event begins or ends during an epoch that is scored as sleep, then the corresponding respiratory event can be scored and included in the computation of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI).

 This situation usually occurs when an individual; has a high AHI with events occurring so frequently that sleep is severely disrupted and epochs may end up being scored as wake even though 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative hypopnea sensor (diagnostic study).

 2.

 The duration of the 30% drop in signal excursion is 10 seconds.

 3.

 There is a 3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or the event is associated with an arousal.

 Subjects once consented and entered into the study, will all have a two week baseline period in which they will use a nasal mask using an airview cpap machine (which records all data).

 After the two week period all will switch to a full face mask with half using the same CPAP pressure and half with a new cpap pressure derived from our formula for the final two weeks.

 Those placed in the randomized into a new pressure will have an experimental procedure of getting a new pressure.

 We expect the AHI of the controls to increase.

 Our two new formulas are referred to as Opred (oronasal) (full face mask) and Npred (nasal) (non-full face mask).

 Npred=(0.

017 AHI)-(0.

092 LSaO2)+(0.

225 NC)+5.

534 Opred=(0.

03 AHI)-(0.

130 LSaO2)+19.

732 NC=Neck circumference, AHI= baseline AHI, LSaO2= Lowest blood oxygen saturation from the baseline polysomnogram.

 These models were developed using multiple linear regressing modeling.

 The study is self-funded because it has no funding.

 Subjects will not be compensated.
