(fifthQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 Following Oral Administration in Chronic Kidney Disease.

 This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, 2-part study designed to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of KBP-5074 in patients undergoing HD and non-HD patients with severe CKD (defined using the eGFR 15 mL/min/1.

73 m2 and 29 mL/min/1.

73 m2 based on the MDRD equation).

 The study will be conducted at up to 4 clinical research units (CRUs) in the US.

 Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in the study (a single cohort of 6 patients in each of Part 1 and Part 2).

 Parts 1 and 2 of the study will be conducted in parallel.

 If Part 1 is completed prior to the completion of Part 2, or vice versa, the PK, safety, and tolerability analyses for the completed study part may proceed as planned and will not be delayed based on the timing of the other respective study part.

 Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 Following Oral Administration in Chronic Kidney Disease@highlight

This study explores the use of KBP-5074 in patients with advanced stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (including patients with severe renal impairment and those on hemodialysis [HD]) and to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of KBP-5074 in male and female patients with severe CKD (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 mL/min/1.

73 m2 and 29 mL/min/1.

73 m2, based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) and a subset of patients requiring HD.
