(firstQuint)Studying a Potential Protective Effect of L-Dopa on Retinitis Pigmentosa.

 Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of progressive hereditary diseases that diffusely affects the functioning of photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium.

 It may be speculated that a protective effect on the pigment epithelium, as it is supposed for L-Dopa, can slow the progression of the disease or even lead to an, at least transient, improvement of visual functions.

 To evaluate the effect of L-Dopa on retinitis pigmentosa progression, visual acuity, electroretinogram and visual field will be preformed regularly.
