(fifthQuint)Wolfram Syndrome International Registry and Clinical Study.

 Background Wolfram syndrome (OMIM #222300) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) in the first decade of life, followed by optic atrophy (OA), blindness, and deafness.

 Death from widespread neurodegeneration occurs in the third or fourth decades.

 Postmortem studies revealed a non-autoimmune loss of pancreatic beta-cells responsible for the diabetes.

The investigators discovered that mutations in the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, a rare Mendelian disease of strong effect in which the signaling pathway may have relevance for the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Protein synthesis in mammalian cells occurs primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

 There are a number of metabolic conditions that disrupt this process, including increased protein synthesis, synthesis of mutated proteins, and others.

 When these conditions occur, they trigger an adaptive response by ER stress sensors that serve to slow protein synthesis, and in extreme conditions lead to apoptosis.

 The investigators discovered that beta-cells exhibit high levels of ER stress in animal models of Wfs1 deficiency.

 High levels of ER stress promoting beta-cell death may be related to the etiology of Wolfram syndrome in patients, but this is unknown at present.

 Rationale Immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation studies have indicated that Wolfram protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with nine transmembrane segments.

 Fibroblasts from a patient with a non-sense mutation in the gene revealed that protein absence was caused by rapid decay of the transcript, and a patient with compound missense mutations exhibited markedly reduced protein stability.

 Thus, in patients with Wolfram syndrome due to certain mutations the protein is present at reduced levels, although the mechanisms for how the protein participates in the ER stress reaction are still under investigation.

 In contrast, only non-inactivating or missense mutations have been described in the autosomal dominant low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHI, OMIM #600965).

 Virtually nothing is known about how the more common polymorphic variants appear to impact the risk for type 2 diabetes.

 Studies in animal models have demonstrated a relationship between ER stress and Wfs1 (n.

b.

 the nomenclature for the human gene is WFS1 and for the mouse is Wfs1).

 Both the Wolfram mRNA and protein are induced by ER stress.

 Glucose-induced insulin secretion also activates Wfs1 expression and a reduction in Wfs1 mRNA results in the activation of ER stress.

 ER stress as a cause of diabetes has been demonstrated in the mouse by knockout of eIF2 kinase (PERK), resulting in beta-cell loss and diabetes, and in a rare genetic disease characterized by mutation of this gene, resulting in early-onset diabetes and epiphyseal dysplasia, the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome.

 These results in mouse models suggest that lack of expression of Wfs1 in beta-cells appears to be a significant contributor to the reduction in beta-cell survival.

 While genetic studies have convincingly demonstrated that mutations in the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, and alterations of expression of Wfs1 protein levels in animal models and cells in culture result in enhanced ER stress, the relationship between WFS1 expression, ER stress, and Wolfram syndrome in humans is unclear.

 The current proposal seeks to have patients with Wolfram syndrome enroll in the Registry.

 A simple peripheral blood draw will be obtained on the patient to obtain DNA for sequencing of the WFS1 gene.

 The research problem is to establish the link between ER stress and diabetes in patients with a monogenic disease of strong effect.

 Analyzing the WFS1 gene mutations from DNA of a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome will allow us to test this hypothesis.

 Achieving this goal in these patients may have profound effects for the ultimate treatment of the very common and complex disease T2D.

 When available, parents and unaffected sibs of patients in the Registry will be invited to participate in the study by donating a blood sample as a control.

 As a first step, the investigators will establish registry and collect blood samples from patients to perform genetic testing and monitor levels of biomarkers.

 Study Design In this study, the investigators hypothesize that studying monogenic variants with strong effect associated with severe insulin deficiency of Wolfram syndrome will provide important insights into the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Aim 1.

 Establish and maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome.

 An Internet based registry will be employed to enroll participants with the clinical diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome (insulin dependent DM and bilateral OA).

 Clinical information regarding age of diagnosis and progression of the disease will be collated and analyzed to better define its natural history, along with potential metabolic phenotypes such as glucose intolerance of heterozygous parents and unaffected sibs.

 If not already completed, blood for WFS1 sequence analysis will be obtained on the participants (parents and sibs also for control purposes) and sent to a CLIA certified lab to define the mutation.

 This information will benefit patient families and referring physicians by providing a genetic diagnosis and where indicated.

 The Wolfram Syndrome Registry will foster international collaborations to more efficiently and systematically collect Wolfram syndrome patients and their clinical and experimental data.
