(fifthQuint)Effect of Chemotherapy vs No Chemotherapy Pre-transplant to MDS Undergoing Allo-HSCT.

 Allo-HSCT appears to be an efficient tool to cure patients with MDS and AML secondary to MDS.

 Decitabine and/or chemotherapy pre-transplantation could reduce the blast cells in bone marrow and improve the complete remission rate.

 However, decitabine and/or chemotherapy had side effects and might increase treatment-related mortality.

 At present, the necessity of chemotherapy pre-transplantation for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion.

 In this study, the effects of chemotherapy and no chemotherapy pre-transplantation in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.

 Effect of Chemotherapy vs No Chemotherapy Pre-transplant to MDS Undergoing Allo-HSCT@highlight

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appears to be an efficient tool to cure refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

 At present, the necessity of chemotherapy pre-transplantation for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion.

 In this study, the effects of chemotherapy and no chemotherapy pre-transplantation in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
