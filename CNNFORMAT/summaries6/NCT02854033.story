(fifthQuint)Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI3) Protocol.

 The overall goal of ADNI3 is to determine the relationships among the clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the pathology evolves from normal aging through very mild symptoms, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to dementia.

 ADNI3 continues the previously funded AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2), and remains a public/private collaboration between academia and industry to study biomarkers of AD.

 ADNI will continue to inform the neuroscience of AD, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, identify outcome measures that can be used in clinical trials, and help develop the most effective clinical trial scenarios.

 This is a non-randomized natural history non-treatment study.

 Participants will need to be 55 - 90 years, otherwise healthy with no neurologic disease such as Alzheimer's disease.

 Approximately 1070 - 2000 participants will be enrolled at approximately 59 sites in the United States and Canada.

 Approximately, 700 - 800 will be rollover participants from previous ADNI studies, and 370 - 1200 will be newly enrolled.

 Clinical/cognitive, imaging, biomarker, and genetic characteristics will be assessed across the three cohorts.

 Subjects will undergo longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments, computerized cognitive batteries, biomarker and genetic tests, PET (FDG, amyloid and tau) and MRI scans and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection for up to 5 years.

 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI3) Protocol@highlight

Since its launch in 2004, the overarching aim of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has been realized in informing the design of therapeutic trials in AD.

 ADNI3 continues the previously funded ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2 studies that have been combined public/private collaborations between academia and industry to determine the relationships between the clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 The overall goal of the study is to continue to discover, optimize, standardize, and validate clinical trial measures and biomarkers used in AD research.
