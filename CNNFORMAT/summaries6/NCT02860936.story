(fifthQuint)Lenvatinib in Recurrent and/or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinomas of the Salivary Glands: ACC-LEN14.

 Carcinomas of the salivary glands (SGCs) are rare, (less than 1% of all cancers of the head and neck and include more than 20 malignant histotypes.

 They can occur both in major and minor salivary glands, are locally aggressive, demonstrating invasiveness that leads to involvement of the facial nerve, skin, bone and surrounding soft tissue.

 The standard treatment is surgical excision, followed by radiotherapy in selected cases such as high-grade histotypes, advanced disease and neck nodes diffusion.

 Loco-regional recurrence occurs in 16% to 85%, it can be managed in very selected cases with further surgery and/or radiotherapy, although the prognosis of these patients remains poor.

 Adenoid cystic cancer (ACC) is the most common SGC histotype observed in metastatic subjects (60%) and distant metastases are the principal cause of failure, being diagnosed in 25-55% of the patients.

 First-line treatment is palliative chemotherapy that is typically not associated with any benefit neither in response rate nor in outcome.

 In preclinical models, VEGF seems to contribute to tumor aggressiveness as well as to distant metastasization, in particular in ACC.

 Moreover, about 80% of ACC are characterized by MYB-NFIB fusion gene.

 Deregulation of MYB involves several genes including those associated with apoptosis, cell cycle control and angiogenesis.

 Clinical evidences support the use of antiangiogenic compounds in ACC.

 Sorafenib a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (VEGFR1-3; PDGFR, RET, cKIT FLT3) and axitinib a potent TKI anti VEGFR1-3 have been tested in advanced ACC, obtaining a 1% of response rate, suggesting some activity agents of this class of drug.

 Recently two whole genome sequencing of ACC tumor/normal pairs have found mutations in genes involved in the FGF/IGF/PI3K pathway (up to 30% of the cases) corroborating the hypothesis that this subset might benefit from agents targeting this pathway.

 Dovitinib, a small molecule that inhibits FGFR, is currently under investigation.

 Preliminary results indicate that the drug produces objective partial responses and prolonged tumor stabilization in patients with progressive ACCs.

 Lenvatinib has a stronger antiangiogenic effect compared to sorafenib and axitinib and has also a higher potency with regard to inhibition of FGFR-1, offering a potential opportunity to block one of the well known mechanisms of resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors.

 Lenvatinib also has a direct oncogenic effect of controlling tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting RET, c-KIT, and PDGFR beta, as well as an effect on the tumor microenvironment by blocking FGFR and PDGFR beta.

 Lenvatinib has been investigated in thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (phase III trials) and in other malignancies, showing high rates of activity.

 Based on preclinical and clinical data, the investigators believe that targeting angiogenesis, FGFR pathway and tumor microenvironment might represent a rational basis to test lenvatinib in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic ACC.

 Lenvatinib in Recurrent and/or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinomas of the Salivary Glands: ACC-LEN14@highlight

ACC is rare and represent approximately 25% of salivary gland carcinomas.

 The standard treatment is surgical excision followed by radiotherapy in selected cases.

 The disease is characterized by a progressive course with local and distant recurrences.

 First-line treatment is palliative chemotherapy that had modest results.

 Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor in ACC of salivary origin has been reported.

 Several papers report that a high percentage of ACCs carries a chromosome translocation that results in the overexpression of the oncogene MYB, which is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and in upregulation of several growth and angiogenetic factors contributing to the autocrine activation of the FGFR and VEGFR-mediated angiogenesis.

 Recently two whole genome sequencing of several ACC tumor/normal pairs have found mutations in genes involved in the FGF/IGF/PI3K pathway corroborating the hypothesis that this subset might benefit from inhibitors of this pathway.

 Based on these premises several antiangiogenic drugs and FGFR inhibitors are currently under investigation and a response rate of 11% was observed in ACC.

 Lenvatinib is an oral multiple RTK inhibitor targeting VEGFR-1-3, FGFR-1-4, RET, c-KIT, and PDGFR.

 On February 13, 2015 the drug has been approved by FDA for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

 Based on preclinical and clinical data, the investigators believe that targeting angiogenesis, FGFR pathway and tumor microenvironment might represent a rational basis to test Lenvatinib in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic ACC.
