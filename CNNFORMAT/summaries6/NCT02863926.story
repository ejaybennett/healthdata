(firstQuint)Use of Autologous Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate in Preventing Wound Complications in Below Knee Amputation (BKA).

 Patients scheduled for BKA will receive bone marrow cells concentrated via the MarrowStim device (cBMA) injected IM at 25 sites in the leg proximal to the BKA in the index limb to prevent ischemic wound complications after surgery.

 cBMA or control (0.

9% NaCl) will be injected into the ATM below the point of amputation at 4 selected sites for analytical purposes.

 Patients will be scheduled for amputation at Days 7, 14, or 21 post injection.

 Safety will be evaluated by review of treatment related adverse events (AE) during the 12-month follow-up period.

 The investigator will compare rates of wound complications and conversion from BKA to AKA to historical controls at the institution to assess trends in therapeutic efficacy.

 Patients will undergo BKA and injection sites will be harvested at that time.

 Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) will determine capillary density and local host immune responses.

 Angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines will be quantified using a multiplex array system and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
