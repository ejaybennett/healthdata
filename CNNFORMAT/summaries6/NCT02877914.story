(thirdQuint)China PEACE 5r-HF Study.

 This study will use a two-stage random sampling design to create a nationally representative sample in China, and randomly sample patients with HF as a primary diagnosis, and were admitted to hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2015.

 The sample size is estimated to be 10,000.

 The investigators will collect photocopies of the sampled medical records and centrally abstract detailed information, which included demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests, in-hospital procedures, lab tests, treatments, and in-hospital outcomes.

 Data abstraction quality was monitored by random auditing of 5% of the medical records, with overall variable accuracy exceeding 98%.

 Analyses will examine patient characteristics, diagnostic testing patterns, in-hospital treatments, in-hospital outcomes, and variation in results across regions and hospitals.

 Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model will be established based on the findings, to improve patient outcomes for HF in the future.
