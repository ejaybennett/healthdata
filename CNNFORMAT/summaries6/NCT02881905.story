(thirdQuint)PeriImplant Soft Tissue and Marginal Bone Loss of Single Implant Mandibular Overdenture.

 Ball attachments are very commonly used because they are solitary, simple, easier to use and less technique sensitive if compared to bar attachments.

 However, ball attachment require a prosthetic space of 12 mm and could show tremendous wear if implants were mal-aligned.

 CM LOC attachment is newly introduced into market with very good expectations regarding its properties and effect on the periimplant soft tissue.

 CM LOC attachment, which combes titanium patrix and resin matrix made from polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), is a very promising material regarding the wear and the prosthesis retention it provides, even with mal-aligned implants.

 However, the clinical performance of this attachment was not tested yet.

 Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial it was decided to compare between CM LOC and the commonly used ball attachment regarding the soft tissue health and marginal bone loss.

 PeriImplant Soft Tissue and Marginal Bone Loss of Single Implant Mandibular Overdenture@highlight

There is a significant difference between CM LOC and ball attachment, when considering the peri-implant soft tissue health and marginal bone loss.

 The primary and secondary objectives are to determine if CM LOC attachment improves the peri-implant soft tissue response and decreases the marginal bone loss around implant when compared to conventional ball attachment
