(secondQuint)Effects of Low Protein Diet in Preventing the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)---a Prospective Study.

 Dietary protein restriction represents a basic therapeutic approach in chronic kidney disease(CKD), by reducing the accumulation of nitrogen catabolic substances, and by delaying the progress of CKD and proteinuria, but the effects of the low protein diet on renal failure progression rate remain to be determined.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of low protein diet and -keto acid tablet in retard the progress of CKD.

 This is a prospective study, 100 patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included.

 The changes of glomerular filtration rate in CKD and time to renal replacement will be evaluated after 1 year treatment.
