(fifthQuint)Safety and Tolerability of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (EN3835) to Treat Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroids).

 Collagenase enzyme breaks down collagen and has shown efficacy in clinical trials for a number of diseases for which there is an accumulation of collagen.

 It is possible that lysis of collagen may reduce the collagen content of fibroids thus decreasing the size of fibroids, and possibly reducing the stiffness of fibroids.

 This may result in reducing the symptoms of pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.

 In this study three subjects will be injected with saline only followed immediately by hysterectomy in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method.

 Twelve subjects will receive a single injection of study drug as follows: three subjects will receive a set dose of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 24-96 hours later (Group 1) to evaluate safety of the injection of study drug.

 Nine subjects will then receive increasing doses of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 60-90 days later (Group 2).

 Safety and Tolerability of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (EN3835) to Treat Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroids)@highlight

This pilot study evaluates the safety and tolerability of a single injection of collagenase enzyme directly into a uterine fibroid in subjects already selected for hysterectomy or myomectomy.

 Fibroids contain excessive amounts of collagen and it is possible that digestion of collagen may be beneficial in reducing pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.

 Three subjects will be injected with saline only to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method.

 Additional subjects will then be injected with increasing doses of study drug.
