(secondQuint)Study of Ultrasonographic Cava Femoral Ratio in the Critically Ill Patient With Shock.

 Among patients presenting with severe abdominal disease and shock, observations shown that the diameter of the common femoral vein was larger than the inferior vena cava.

 The hypothesis is that this observation could be secondary to a compression of the inferior vena cava related to an increased intra abdominal pressure.

 Study of Ultrasonographic Cava Femoral Ratio in the Critically Ill Patient With Shock@highlight

This study aims to describe the ratio of the diameter of inferior vena cava to the common femoral vein measured by ultrasonography in critically ill patients with shock, and to evaluate the potential link between this ratio and the existence of intra-abdominal disease.
