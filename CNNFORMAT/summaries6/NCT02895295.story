(thirdQuint)Evaluating a Patient-Centered Tool to Help Medicare Beneficiaries Choose Prescription Drug Plans.

 In this study, the investigators will test the effectiveness of two versions of a web-based tool (called CHOICE) to help people choose among Medicare Part D plans (Treatments A and B) relative to each other and relative to standard care (Control).

 Both treatment arms will incorporate simplified design and automated importation of an individual's prescription drugs relative to standard care.

 The treatment arms vary based on whether they provide expert guidance on recommended plans.

 In the control arm, study participants will be directed to the existing, publicly available Medicare.

gov website and will receive instructions on how to download their drugs from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF) patient-facing online personal health portal (myhealthonline).

 Our study sample will include PAMF patients who were enrolled in Part D plans (not Medicare Advantage) during the 2016 enrollment period.

 Prior to the 2017 open enrollment period (October 15 to December 7, 2016), we will invite a subset of PAMF patients enrolled in Part D plan, age 66-85, and in 4 counties served by PAMF to participate in a study examining the effectiveness of decision tools that provide personalized information on the financial implications of enrolling in different Part D plans.

 The primary study outcomes will include 1) Plan switching, 2) Decisional conflict 3) Satisfaction with the choice process, and 4) Change in generosity of coverage of prescription drugs.

 The investigators will measure the primary study outcomes using a combination of administrative data and a post open enrollment survey administered to all study participants.

 The investigators will also collect information on individual characteristics at the time of enrollment in the study and implement a survey examining use of the intervention tool to assess patient experience at the time of use.
