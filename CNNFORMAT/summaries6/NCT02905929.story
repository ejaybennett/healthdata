 Trial to Reduce Sitting Time in Postmenopausal Latina Women at Increased Risk for Heart Disease@highlight

Project 2 of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) American Heart Association (AHA) Women's Health Program will assess 3-month changes in sitting time, standing time, physical activity and blood pressure in a randomized control trial (RCT).

 This 2-arm RCT will occur in the community with post menopausal Latina women (N=250) who spend at least 8 hrs/day sitting and have increased risk for cardiovascular disease through high BMI and other cardiometabolic risk factors.

 Women will be identified through the San Ysidro Health Center and assessed at the South Bay Latino Research Center.
