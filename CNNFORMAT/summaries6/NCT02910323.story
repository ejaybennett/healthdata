(secondQuint)The Will Erwin Headache Research Center - Cluster Headache Study.

 The Will Erwin Headache Research Center will assemble a national registry of Cluster Headache patients and will sub-categorize and organize this cohort based on individuating characteristics including but not limited to type and severity of condition, associated symptoms, and medical/psychological issues (e.

g.

, depression, disability, sleep).

 Detailed evaluations and classification will be completed for each enrolled subject.

 This will encompass genomic and epigenomic studies, past medical history, imaging reports, and specific physical exam results for each patient.

 It will also enable the study investigators to match patients with suitable interventional clinical trials.

 Similar diseases, such as other paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, SUNA, hemicrania continua, and trigeminal neuralgia may also be investigated.
