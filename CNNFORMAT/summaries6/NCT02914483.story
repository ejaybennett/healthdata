(fifthQuint)Women's Heart Attack Research Program: Stress Ancillary Study.

 Women's HARP is a multi-center, observational study which enrolls women with MI who are referred for cardiac catheterization.

 During the MI hospitalization, questionnaires will be administered to assess psychosocial stress leading up to the event (MI).

 Participants will also have the option to enroll in the HARP-Stress Ancillary Study and HARP-Platelet Sub-Study.

 Two months following MI, participants may be screened for the Stress Ancillary Study.

 Women with elevated perceived stress at screening will be enrolled.

 Patients will complete baseline assessments (self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy) and then will be randomized to group-based stress management or to enhanced usual care (EUC).

 Both study arms involve 8 weekly phone sessions delivered by trained facilitators.

 Following intervention, participants in both study arms will repeat self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy.

 Anticipate enrollment of approximately 200 women to meet target of 144 qualified women.
