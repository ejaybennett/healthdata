(fifthQuint)SPCG17: Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Trigger Trial.

 STUDY HYPOTHESIS The study hypothesis is that standardized triggers for initiation of curative treatment of men who are in active surveillance will reduce over-treatment without increasing disease progression and prostate cancer mortality.

 STUDY DESIGN Randomized multi-centre open-label clinical trial INTERVENTIONS Computerized randomisation (1:1) within 12 months from diagnosis of prostate cancer, either to active surveillance according to current practice at the trial centre (reference arm), or to a standardised active surveillance protocol applying specific criteria for repeat biopsies and the initiation of curative treatment (experimental arm).

 Patients are stratified by centre and Gleason score.

 Follow-up both groups: PSA every 6 months, clinical examination (with PSA test) annually, and multiparametric MRI every second year.

 Repeat biopsies (reference arm): Current practice Repeat biopsies (experimental arm), standardised triggers: 1.

 A systematic repeat biopsy if PSA density increases to > 0.

2 ng/ml/cc, and then at every 0.

1 ng/ml/cc increase 2.

 MRI progression in men with previously only Gleason grade 3+3: 5 mm or more increase in size in any dimension of a measurable lesion, increase in PI-RADS score to 3-5, a new lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5, or new suspicion of extra-capsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion 3.

 MRI progression in men with Gleason grade 3+4: 5 mm or more increase in size in any dimension of a measurable lesion, or a new lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5 Curative treatment (reference arm): Current practice Curative treatment (experimental arm), standardised triggers: 1.

 MRI progression in lesions with confirmed Gleason grade 4: increase in PI-RADS score to 4 or 5, or new suspicion of extra-capsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion 2.

 Pathological progression: Gleason pattern 5, primary Gleason pattern 4 in any core with 5 mm or more cancer, Gleason 3+4 in 3 or more cores or 30% if more than 10 cores are taken, or Gleason 3+4 in 10 mm or more cancer Patients will be followed continuously until initiation of treatment, the event of metastasis, to a break point where active surveillance is considered terminated and watchful waiting starts, or to death of any cause.

 After the initiation of curative treatment, watchful waiting, or palliative treatment for cancer progression, the patient is followed according to the standard protocol of the participating centre.

 SPCG17: Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Trigger Trial@highlight

A large proportion of men with prostate cancer are overdiagnosed and overtreated mainly due to PSA testing.

 Active surveillance (AS) aims to reduce these harms by recommending curative treatment only when and if signs of tumor progression occur.

 There are however a number of uncertainties in AS, the most important being when to initiate treatment.

 The investigators are therefore starting a large randomized multicenter trial testing the safety of a standardized active surveillance protocol with specified triggers for repeat biopsies and initiation of curative treatment.

 The standardized protocol is compared with current practice for active surveillance.

 The primary aim of the study is to reduce overtreatment and subsequent side effects, without increasing the risk of disease progression or prostate cancer mortality.
