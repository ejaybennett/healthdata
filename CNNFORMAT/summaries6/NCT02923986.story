(thirdQuint)Clinical Trial of BP1001 (Liposomal Grb2 Antisense Oligonucleotide) in Combination With Dasatinib in Patients With Ph + CML.

 The Grb2 gene has been mapped to the human chromosome region 17q22-qter, a region that is duplicated in leukemias and solid tumors, which may result in an increased copy number of the Grb2 gene product.

 As Grb2 is important for the transformation of murine hematopoietic cells, and the proliferation of human leukemia cells that express high levels of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, inhibition of Grb2 may have a significant impact on the natural history of leukemias.

 The study drug (BP1001) may be able to inhibit the cells from making Grb-2.

 Researchers hope that without this protein, the leukemia cells will die.

 Dasatinib (Das) has been a well established therapeutic regimen in the treatment of Ph+ CML patients who are in accelerated of blast phase.

 Researchers hope that the combination of BP1001 and Das will provide a benefit to CML patients in accelerated or blast phase, who typically do not respond to the front-line treatment, imatinib.

 This is a Phase Ib/IIa, multicenter, study of BP1001 in combination with Das in participants with Ph+ CML who are in accelerated or blast phase.

 This trial will utilize a single arm, open label design to assess the safety profile, DLT, MTD, PK, and efficacy of BP1001 in combination with Das.

 Phase Ib portion of the study: The Phase Ib study employs an open-label, sequential, dose-escalation design to assess safety, tolerability and toxicity, tumor response and anti-leukemic activity.

 A standard "3+3" design will be used in which successive cohorts of patients with CML are being treated with BP1001 at the MTD (or highest tested dose [HTD] if the MTD is not defined) and 1 level below the MTD (or HTD) in combination with a fixed dose of Das to characterize safety and biological effect, as well as identify the recommended Phase IIa dose.

 Phase IIa portion of the study: The Phase IIa study is an open-label, single-dose level study.

 All participants who are eligible to receive treatment on study will receive the same dose level for both BP1001 (the HTD or 1 level below the HTD) as determined by the Phase Ib study and Das (140 mg).

 There will be no randomization for this study.

 The Phase IIa study will compare the efficacy of the BP1001 in combination with Das to historical response rates documented for Das alone, and will evaluate the PK of BP1001, when given alone or in combination with Das.

 Approximately 40 evaluable participants will receive the combination of BP1001 with Das in Phase IIa.

The primary objective of the Phase 1b study is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of BP1001 and Dasatinib (Das) in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in accelerated or blast phase.

 The primary objective of the Phase IIa study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of BP1001 and Das in patients with Ph+ CML.
