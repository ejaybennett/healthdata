(thirdQuint)Clinical Performance of Nano Plus Sirolimus-Eluting Stents in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.

 This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm clinical registry investigating the safety and efficacy of polymer-free sirolimus-eluting coronary stent system (NANO plus) in patients with coronary artery disease .

 In total, we plan to recruit 2500 patients in real world setting.

 The patients will be followed clinically at 1-, 6- month and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year.

 All clinical data will be collected and managed by statistical center, clinical endpoint adjudication committee.
