(secondQuint)Application of Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Devices and Their Value in Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Retrospective Analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry.

 In a retrospective analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry between 2007-2014, investigators examined the outcome after using mechanical CPR on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

 Investigators compared mechanical CPR (Intervention group) to manual CPR (control group).

 According to preclinical risk factors, investigators calculated the predicted ROSC-after-cardiac-arrest (RACA) score for each group, and compared it to the rate of ROSC observed.

 Using multivariate analysis, investigators adjusted the influence of the devices' application on ROSC for epidemiological factors and therapeutic measures.

 Application of Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Devices and Their Value in Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Retrospective Analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry@highlight

The aim of this study was to analyse a large CPR database, the German Resuscitation Registry, to evaluate potential benefits of mechanical CPR devices over manual CPR in adult cardiac arrest victims.

 The primary endpoint considered is ROSC.
