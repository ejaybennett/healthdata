(fifthQuint)MIND Programme for Cancer Patients.

 The sample will include diagnosed cancer patients recruited at an Oncology Service at the Coimbra's University Hospital.

 Patients will be approached by their doctor to assess their level of interest in the investigation.

 Patients who demonstrate interest will go through a Screening interview conducted by a licensed psychologist that aims explain the structure and arms of the investigation, to collect demographic data, and whether the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study.

 Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and demonstrate interest in participating in the study, will sign an informed consent.

 All ethical requirements for research with humans are guaranteed.

 Afterwards, participants will be randomized in two groups (experimental and control group).

 Both groups will maintain the medical treatment as usual (TAU).

 Additionally, the experimental group will enroll in the MIND programme for cancer patients, also provided by a licensed psychologist and a co-therapist.

 Both groups will concurrently complete a protocol of self-report measures and their medical data will be collected by the medical staff of the Hospital (to measure main three areas: a) psychological processes; b) quality of life and psychopathology; c) current medical status).

 These assessments will occur in four different times: before the start of the MIND programme M0), after the final session of the programme (M1), and 3 (M2) and 6 months (M4) after that.

 MIND Programme for Cancer Patients@highlight

This investigation aims to apply and test the feasibility of an acceptance, mindfulness and compassionate-based intervention structured for cancer patients.

 MIND programme for cancer thus comprises 8 weekly group sessions, lasting 1 and a half hour each, run in small groups at an Oncology Service at the Coimbra's University Hospital.

 For each week participants have assigned homework (e.

g.

, mindfulness exercises).

 This programme mainly aims to increase participants' physical and psychosocial quality of life, and attenuate depressed mood and anxiety.

 Additionally, this study also intends to explore whether the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms will promote better results in the medical treatments of the participants, and influence the course and prognosis of the illness.
