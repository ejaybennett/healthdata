(fifthQuint)Cangrelor Following Ticagrelor Loading vs Ticagrelor Loading Alone in STEMI.

 A rapid and consistent platelet inhibition represents the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment in the early hours of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with expected improvement in outcome.

 Current practice guidelines recommend administration of a loading dose (LD) of an oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist as early as possible or at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or at first medical contact.

 Pharmacodynamic data have clearly shown a delay in the onset of action when prasugrel or ticagrelor are administered in patients with STEMI - compared to what is obtained in stable or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients-, which is most likely caused by an impaired absorption.

 Peri-interventional platelet inhibition is therefore suboptimal in most cases of timely performed primary PCI, even when novel oral antiplatelet agents with faster than clopidogrel action are used.

 Modifications of the loading dose or antiplatelet pre-hospital administration may only partially 'bridge the gap" in platelet inhibition.

 On the other hand, cangrelor is a parenteral P2Y12 antagonist, with a rapid -within minutes- onset of action, able to provide very strong and consistent platelet inhibition and with rapid offset of action- within 60 min of infusion discontinuation.

 In the CHAMPION PHOENIX (Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition) trial cangrelor reduced the incidence of ischemic events, without increasing the incidence of severe bleeding.

 Ticagrelor is an oral antiplatelet agent which has been reported that can be given before or during infusion of cangrelor without attenuation of cangrelor's pharmacodynamic effects, while the pharmacodynamic effects of ticagrelor are preserved when ticagrelor is given during infusion of cangrelor.

 It seems therefore, that ticagrelor has favorable characteristics for patients intended to receive cangrelor.

 In the present study, in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI the investigators aim to compare platelet inhibition achieved in patients loaded with ticagrelor followed by cangrelor (bolus plus infusion) vs ticagrelor alone loaded patients.

 This will be a prospective, randomized, 3-center, single-blind, investigator-initiated study of parallel design to compare platelet inhibition provided by ticagrelor LD plus cangrelor (bolus and infusion) vs ticagrelor LD alone.

 Participants will be consecutive P2Y12 inhibitor-naive STEMI patients with pain onset208 PRU.

 Cangrelor Following Ticagrelor Loading vs Ticagrelor Loading Alone in STEMI@highlight

Platelets and thrombus formation play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary artery occlusion and subsequent myocardial infarction.

 Apart from mechanically opening the occluded artery with angioplasty, adjunctive antiplatelet treatment is of utmost importance.

 However, orally administered antiplatelet agents exhibit a delay in their onset of action in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and angioplasty is mostly performed without adequate platelet inhibition.

 Cangrelor is an intravenous antiplatelet agent which can provide almost immediate strong platelet inhibition.

 The investigators aim to compare a strategy of cangrelor administered on top of ticagrelor-an oral antiplatelet agent- vs ticagrelor alone, on their efficacy to inhibit platelet function in the early hours of an acute myocardial infarction.
