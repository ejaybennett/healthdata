(thirdQuint)Glutathione (GSH) Synthesis in Healthy School-aged Children.

 Glutathione (GSH) is important to protect the cells of the body.

 It is made from amino acids found in the protein obtained from foods we eat.

 This antioxidant is important to protect the cells of the body from damage.

 Low levels of GSH are found in healthy persons not getting enough protein in their diet.

 Inadequate protein intake in children not only compromises growth, but could increase susceptibility to, and compromise recovery from regular childhood illness.

 Measurement of GSH synthesis provides a functional method whereby the current protein recommendation can be tested against higher estimates derived using the IAAO method.

 The current dietary reference intake (DRI) recommendations for protein in children between the ages of 6-11 years is based on nitrogen balance data and set at a mean (EAR) and population safe (RDA) recommendation of 0.

 Using the indicator amino oxidation (IAAO) method we estimated the mean and population safe protein requirement in the same age group of children to be 1.

The purpose of this study therefore is to measure GSH synthesis in school aged children aged 6-11 years in response to current recommended protein intake and in response to protein requirement estimate derived using the IAAO method.

 Glutathione (GSH) Synthesis in Healthy School-aged Children@highlight

The fractional and absolute synthesis rates of GSH, an antioxidant that protects cells from damage, in the erythrocytes of healthy school-aged children in response to graded intakes of protein to determine if increasing the protein intake above the current recommended DRI produces increases in the GSH synthesis rates in erythrocytes of healthy school-aged children.

 Participants will consume specially formulated diets with varying protein levels.
