(firstQuint)Intraocular Cytokine in Recurrence of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.

 PCV is regarded as a subtype of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), but has several different features such as polypoidal terminal of new vessels, and relative resistance to anti-VEGF treatment.

 Other cytokines then VEGF are thought to be associated with development and progression of the disease.

 The aim of the this study is to investigate intraocular cytokines related to recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

 Aqueous humor will be sampled from the anterior chamber at baseline, after loading injections of ranibizumab and at recurrence.

 The concentration of various cytokines will be measured in the aqueous humor.

Changes of intraocular cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will be measured in recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) during treatment of ranibizumab.
