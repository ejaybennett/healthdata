(firstQuint)Steroid Nasal Irrigation for Flavor Evaluation and Detection Study.

 We wish to determine the effect of budesonide nasal saline irrigation on the ability to smell or taste in a cohort of patients who complain of anosmia/hyposmia.

 In this project, our aim is first to identify those who suffer from olfactory disturbance using a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 Next, we will test their baseline perception of smell and taste using a battery of tests - University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Sniffin Sticks, and Uni-nasal Peanut Butter Odor Detection Test (UPBODT) for smell; National Institute of Health (NIH) Taste Intensity Test with general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) and n-Propyluracil (PROP) Taster Test for taste.

 Then, subjects will be treated with budesonide nasal saline irrigation for 30 days and their perception of smell will be retested using these same assessments.

 Subjects who do not show improvement from the baseline results of these composite tests will go on to complete a 12-week smell training intervention program, after which they will redo the battery of smell tests.

 For the smell training intervention, subjects will smell 4 odors (phenyl ethyl alcohol, eucalyptus, lemon, eugenol) twice a day for 12 weeks.

 Once more, we will assess post-intervention smell and taste function in patients undergoing the smell training program to see if they display any improvement.

 The aims of our study will be 1) to assess the ability of a 30-day treatment with budesonide nasal irrigation to impact sense of smell and 2) to assess whether a 12-week smell training intervention is effective for subjects with anosmia or hyposmia who fail to improve after budesonide nasal irrigation treatment.

The purpose of this research study is to determine if budesonide nasal saline irrigation or smell training intervention impact sense of smell.
