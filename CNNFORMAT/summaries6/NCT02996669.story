(fifthQuint)Autism Biomarker Consortium for Clinical Trials.

 The specified aims of this study are to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers.

 These hypothesized outcomes could then be used to reduce the heterogeneity of samples via stratification, could possibly indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement.

 The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool and school-aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with intelligence quotient(s) (IQ) ranging from 50-150.

 Children will be assessed across three time points (Baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status.

 Autism Biomarker Consortium for Clinical Trials@highlight

This is a multicenter longitudinal study that aims to identify, develop and validate a set of measures that can be used as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective measures of social impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that could serve as markers of long term clinical outcome.

 The main study will include 275 individuals: 200 ASD subjects between 6-11 years old, and 75 TD subjects roughly matched by age and sex to the ASD group.
