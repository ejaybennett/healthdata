(thirdQuint)Long-Term Follow Up Study.

 This is a long-term follow up study of the 'Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression' (CAN-BIND) study.

 The CAN-BIND study examines biological markers of antidepressant treatment response.

 The examined biomarkers included clinical, imaging, and genetic components.

 The Long Term Follow up (LTFU) study will continue to follow the patients in this study each six months over a five year period.

 By doing so, a comprehensive clinical outcome data on a well characterized cohort of depressed patients will be obtained.

 The research team will conduct a naturalistic study of CAN-BIND participants and will monitor the longitudinal progress in mood, functioning, and quality of life, with a view towards advising future treatment options.

 Each patient completing CAN-BIND will be asked to participate in the LTFU study.

The LTFU study will conduct a naturalistic follow up of the well characterized CAN-BIND study population of patients every six months and continuing over a five-year period.

 This will provide information on the longitudinal progress in mood, functioning, and quality of life of the CAN-BIND sample with a view towards long-term outcome and treatment.
