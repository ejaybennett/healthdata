(secondQuint)A Study to Determine the Effectiveness of Utilizing Intraperitoneal Bupivacaine.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using intraperitoneal anesthetic during appendectomy.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive either 20 mL 0.

5% bupivicaine or 20 mL of normal saline (placebo) instilled in the right lower quadrant at the cecum after appendix has been removed.

 Narcotic consumption will be tracked postoperatively.

 Hypothesis is that instilling local anesthetic at the cecum during a laparoscopic appendectomy will decrease the amount of narcotic a patient uses postoperatively.

 Secondarily, this study will attempt to determine if there is a decrease in length of stay for the subjects randomized to the anesthetic infiltration.
