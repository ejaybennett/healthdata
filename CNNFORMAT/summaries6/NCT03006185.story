(secondQuint)Laser and Microdermabrasion Before Photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratoses in Field-cancerized Skin.

 For each study participant, two test areas (A and B) are demarcated in the same anatomical region, with each area containing no less than 5 actinic keratoses (AKs).

 Test areas are randomized to receive skin pretreatment of EITHER ablative fractional laser OR microdermabrasion prior to photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate.

 Efficacy, local skin reactions and safety of both test areas are evaluated over a 12-15 week follow up period.
