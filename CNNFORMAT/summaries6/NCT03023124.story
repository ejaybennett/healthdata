(firstQuint)Study With Trabectedin Versus Adriamycin Plus Dacarbazine, in Patients With Advanced Solitary Fibrous Tumor.

 Patients with solitary fibrous tumor will be randomized to receive 6 cycles of trabectedin or doxorubicin plus dacarbazine.

 In case of progression or unacceptable toxicity while under the experimental treatment prior to the completion of the 6 cycles, the patients will be offered to cross to the other arm (trabectedin arm to doxorubicin plus dacarbazine arm and vice versa).
