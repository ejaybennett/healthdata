(thirdQuint)Retrospective Evaluation of Athens Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) Database.

 Identified data will be provided to the PI from Live Healthy Appalachia/CHIP on a flash drive.

 This data will be password protected by the research team.

 The data will consist of two different databases, 1) identifiers with health screen results, 2) identifiers with demographics (age, gender, household member in class).

 The researchers need data from both databases for this study.

 Each participant has been assigned a unique participant number by CHIP.

 The databases will be combined by the research team, allowing the demographics to be matched to the biomarkers.

 The unique CHIP identifier will be maintained as a participant ID, while all other identifying data will then be deleted from the database.

 The data will then be analyzed for relationships by a statistician.

 Retrospective Evaluation of Athens Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) Database@highlight

Data from participants in Athens CHIP classes from May 2011 to present will be analyzed to evaluate the differences in outcomes based on: 1) gender, 2) age, 3) whether a household member participated in the class with them.

 Participants had health screens before and after completing the class.

 The data from the health screens that will be utilized for comparison will include: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar and lipid levels.
