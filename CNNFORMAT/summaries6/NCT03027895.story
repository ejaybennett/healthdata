(secondQuint)Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Drainage of Walled Off Necrosis (WON).

 Patient with pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON) would be treated randomized with lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) or double pigtail plastic stents (DPPSs) under the guidance of Endoscopic Ultrasonography.

 The investigators compare the effect of the two stents, including technical success, clinical success, adverse event, recurrence, and so on.
