(secondQuint)Perioperative Chemotherapy Plus Cetuximab Versus Chemotherapy Alone for High Risk Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastasis.

 Resection could prolong the survival of colorectal liver metastasis patients, however,the curative resection rate was still low and more than 2/3 of the patients would experience tumor recurrence.

This study was designed to formulate a more accurate and individual evaluation system via the multivariate analysis.

 Up to now, there was no data to demonstrate the addition of cetuximab to perioperative chemotherapy could decrease recurrence and prolong survival for RAS wild-type, high risk(Clinical Risk Score3) resectable colorectal liver metastasis patients.

 This study was also designed to elucidate this question and to observe the objective response rate(ORR) and the safety data of the regime.
