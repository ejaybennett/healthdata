(fifthQuint)Thrombin Generation and Platelet Activation in CRS/HIPEC.

 The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of CRS and HIPEC, on various components of hemostasis.

 Routine laboratory assays such as activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, or platelet count might, as demonstrated previously, insufficiently provide specificity and/or sensitivity to assess coagulation and platelet disorders.

 Therefore, additionally thrombin generation (TG) was analyzed by the calibrated automated thrombogram assay (CAT).

 Also, platelet function was quantitatively assessed by the PAC-t-UB assay and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to elucidate the contribution of platelets, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways in peri-operative bleeding.

 The hypothesis of this study was that the procedure exposed an increased thrombotic risk, resulting in a faster and increased TG and hyper platelet function?.

 Thrombin Generation and Platelet Activation in CRS/HIPEC@highlight

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal peroperative chemotherapy (HIPEC), indicated for patients with peritoneal metastases from digestive or gynecological malignancies alike, demonstrates a considerable impact on hemostatic metabolism, both on platelet and on coagulation level.

 The potential hemostatic interference in CRS and HIPEC is phase dependent.

 This study demonstrates the combined use of ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry), PACT (platelet activation test) and CAT (thrombin generation test) assays during CRS and HIPEC with a follow-up of 7 days postoperative.
