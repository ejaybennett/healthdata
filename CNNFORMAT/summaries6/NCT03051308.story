(secondQuint)University of Wisconsin Solution Versus New Parathyroid Transport Solution for Parathyroid Allotransplantation.

 Parathormone (PTH) and vitamin D are two critical hormonal regulators of calcium homeostasis.

 There is an important relationship between the PTH release and vitamin D receptor for controlling hormonal systems.

 Also calcium-sensing receptor plays a crucial role in regulating parathormone secretion which means controlling the calcium-dependent systemic ion homeostasis.

 Cold ischemia protects organs and tissues by slowing their metabolism.

 The cold ischemia of the transplant tissue is a very important process.

 The University of Wisconsin (UW) solution substantially improves graft preservation and consequently increases patient survival.

 The researchers newly developed NPTS for transportation of parathyroid glands.

 For the comparision the researchers measured the parathyroid cell viability and the calcium sensing and vitamin D receptor density of the parathyroid cells at the 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours of cold ischemia.

Compare the functionality of new parathyroid transport solution (NPTS) with University of Wisconsin Solution (UW) on parathyroid glands.

 Also assess its effects on cell viability, parathormone (PTH) secretion, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels during cold ischemia.
