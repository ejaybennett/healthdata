 Diets that produce lower glucose and insulin responses may reduce diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

 They may also facilitate weight control by promoting satiety, insulin sensitivity and optimal insulin secretion after a meal.

 Food ingredients may indeed reduce postprandial glucose and insulin response through an inhibition of -amylase and -glucosidase activity that may slow down the absorption of carbohydrates.

 InSea2(R) is a unique combination of polyphenolic extracts of brown algae (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus) which has been shown to inhibit the action of -amylase and -glucosidase.

 Preliminary data in healthy men and women have demonstrated a reducing effect on plasma insulin of a single intake of InSea2(R) consumed with a high-carbohydrate meal.

 The main objective is to evaluate the effects of a daily dietary supplement of 500 mg (2 capsules) of brown algae extract powder (InSea2(R)) on blood glucose measured 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in overweight insulin-resistant men and women.

 The secondary objectives are to assess the contribution of a daily consumption of this supplement (InSea2(R)) on weight loss when associated with a daily caloric restriction of 500 kcal due to individualized nutritional intervention.

 More specifically, the investigators aim to evaluate the effects of supplementation combined with weight loss on other markers of glucose metabolism (fasting plasma glucose, glucose and insulin response during OGTT, insulin sensitivity measurement parameters and insulin secretion during OGTT), lipid profile, blood pressure and metabolic syndrome criteria.

 The investigators expect that InSea2(R) lowers the high levels of blood glucose and insulin observed 2 hours after a meal in overweight insulin-resistant human subjects.

The overall goal of this study is to investigate the effects of a daily dietary supplement of brown seaweed (2 capsules of InSea2(R)) on body weight, glycemic control and insulin secretion in overweight prediabetic men and women in association with a moderate weight loss intervention.
