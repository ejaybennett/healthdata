(firstQuint)MicroRNAs in Acute Kidney Injury.

 In this pilot study we will include 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in a German university hospital.

 We will profile microRNA expression in plasma and urine before and at several timepoints after surgery.

 We will use a preselected panel of microRNAs and lncRNAs for analysis.

 Goal is to identify microRNAs/lncRNAs that are able to predict the occurence of AKI in these patients.
