(fifthQuint)Plinabulin vs.

 Pegfilgrastim in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Docetaxel Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy.

 This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study with a phase 2 portion and a phase 3 portion.

 Approximately 190 patients will be enrolled in this study.

 All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2.

 In Phase 2, patients only with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy will be enrolled.

 In Phase 3, patients with one of the following will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed 1 but 1 but < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer.

 Each eligible patient will be stratified according to his or her diagnosis (advanced or metastatic breast cancer, NSCLC, or HRPC).

 Patients will be randomly assigned with equal probability (1:1 ratio) or 75:75, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows: Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (RP3D) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.
