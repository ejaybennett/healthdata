(secondQuint)Amino Acid-based Oral Rehydration Solution in Children With Short Bowel Syndrome.

 Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have a critical reduction of the gut mass/function that is below the minimum needed to absorb nutrients and fluids required for adequate homeostasis.

 There are limited data regarding the optimal choice for oral rehydration in the setting of SBS that can maximize fluid absorption in the setting of diarrhea with limited intestinal absorptive surface area.

 The investigators propose a preliminary open label single center study assessing tolerability and palatability of enterade(R) ( an amino acid (AA) based oral rehydrating solution (ORS)) and compare to baseline.

 Eligible patients with SBS will participate in a 14-day trial monitoring and measuring tolerability and palatability of an AA-ORS, enterade(R), in addition to their regular diet.
