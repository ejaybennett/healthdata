(thirdQuint)Using A Novel Classification System in Intravenous GCs Therapy of TAO: A Multi-central, Randomized, Open, Superior Trial.

 TAO is one of most common extra thyroid manifestation of dysfunctional thyroid disease.

 Since the morbidity of TAO has been increasing rapidly, Investigators' team is intended to verify the feasibility of the new type of classification system established by the related parameters of orbital MRI scan.

 Based on classification, investigators compare the efficacy of two GCs therapy.

 According to MRI,investigators measure the optimal T2 signal intensity ratio (SIR) for the treatment of TAO, which may help to find a better treatment time for therapy.

 Using A Novel Classification System in Intravenous GCs Therapy of TAO: A Multi-central, Randomized, Open, Superior Trial@highlight

For patients with active moderate-to-severe thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), the Intravenous Glucocorticoids (GCs) is the recommended therapy.

 However, the efficacy of GCs is not satisfied.

 Investigators established a novel classification of TAO for the first time to assess more precisely for better personal treatment.
