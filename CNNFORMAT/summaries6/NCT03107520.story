(secondQuint)Intraoperative Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Evaluation of Blood Flow After Surgical Hip Reduction for DDH.

 For children presenting with late-diagnosed developmental dysplasia of the hip, a closed or open hip reduction followed by hip spica casting may be indicated if conservative treatment fails.

 Although closed or open reduction and casting is largely successful for relocating a hip, iatrogenic avascular necrosis remains a major source of morbidity as a result of the surgical procedure.

 Although recent evidence has demonstrated that postoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) studies may be useful in assessing perfusion of the hip after surgery, these studies are not performed until after the cast is placed and they do not elucidate the specific intraoperative steps that increase risk for osteonecrosis.

 Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be a reliable and effective alternative.

This study evaluates the feasibility and utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to provide real-time assessment of blood flow to the femoral head in infants undergoing surgical reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip.
