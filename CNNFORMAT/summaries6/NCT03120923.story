(secondQuint)Combined Corticosteroid With Low Volume Compared to High Volume in Impingement Syndrome.

 Patients with rotator cuff impingement syndrome were randomized to undergo subacromial injection with 10mL total volume of 1% lidocaine plus 40mg triamcinolone acetonide (n = 22), or a 4mL total volume of 1% lidocaine plus 40-mg triamcinolone acetonide (n = 23).

 Evaluations using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain during motion, and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) were completed before treatment and 30 minutes, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks after injection.
