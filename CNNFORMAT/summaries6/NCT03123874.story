(fifthQuint)Milk in Life Conditions (MiLC): Bacterial Composition of Human Milk Pumped and Stored in "Real-Life" Conditions.

 Participants will donate 1 oz of human milk during each of two consecutive pumping sessions, for a total volume of 2 oz donated on one day.

 To collect this human milk, participants will be asked to fully express one breast during each pumping session.

 Participants will pump once with the participant's own pump and bottles and once with the sterile pump and sterile bottles (provided by the research team).

 Women will be randomized to which pump is used first.

 All human milk collections will occur at participants' homes between 0700 and 1100 hours.

 The second pumping session must begin 3 hours (+/-30 minutes) after the beginning of the first pumping session (e.

g.

 the first pumping session at 7:30 am and the second at 10:30 am).

 Participants will elect from which breast to donate human milk and that breast will be used for both pumping sessions.

 Participants will be asked not to nurse from or pump that breast during the 2 hours before the first pumping session and not until after the second pumping session (a total of ~5.

5 hours).

 From the milk produced during each pumping session (which could be up to ~6 oz), researchers will collect 1 oz using a sterile, plastic syringe.

 Participants will keep the remaining volume of milk.

 Each ounce of milk collected will be separated into 5 sterile containers (provided).

 Participants will store donated milk at home until it is picked up by a researcher 2, 4, and 30 days after pumping.

 A secondary objective of this trial is to understand how infant feeding status (human milk ONLY or human milk AND complementary foods) influences the human milk microbiome.

 The researchers aim to have 25 participants whose infants are fed human milk ONLY and 25 whose infants are fed human milk AND complementary foods.

 Once 20 participants have been enrolled in one group, researchers will temporarily restrict enrollment to women whose infants are part of the other group.

 If the researchers are unable to achieve 25 participants per group in a timely manner, enrollment of all eligible women will be resumed, regardless of infant feeding status.

 Milk in Life Conditions (MiLC): Bacterial Composition of Human Milk Pumped and Stored in "Real-Life" Conditions@highlight

The MiLC trial is a randomized control trial of two different types of breast pumps--mother's own and sterile.

 The objective of this trial is to investigate the bacterial composition of human milk pumped and stored in "real-life" conditions.

 To meet this objective, lactating mothers will fully express breast milk from one breast on two consecutive pumping sessions at home, once with the participant's own pumps and bottles and once with a sterile, hospital-grade pump and sterile bottles.

 Randomization will be used to determine which pump participants use first.

 From the total volume of milk pumped during each pumping session, the researchers will collect 1 oz.

 Milk from both pumps will be stored at home and sampled on days 0, 2, 4, and 30 after expression for analysis of its bacterial composition.
