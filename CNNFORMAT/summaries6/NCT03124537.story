(thirdQuint)Increasing Physical Activity Among Sedentary Older Adults:What, Where, When, and With Whom.

 Physical activity is broadly beneficial for physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects of health.

 Yet, only one in five U.

S.

 adults meets the CDC physical activity guidelines.

 Making physical activity accessible and feasible throughout life is an important public health policy objective that is within reach with the right kind of behavioral and environmental supports.

 The project aims to provide such supports for an active lifestyle thereby contributing to healthy aging.

The goal of this project is to increase physical activity (i.

e.

, walking) in sedentary older adults by providing the environmental and behavioral resources to incorporate additional steps into their daily lives.

 The investigators will use a behavioral approach that fosters a sense of control and facilitates planning by focusing on the what, when, where, and with whom.

 The investigators propose a user-friendly practical way to increase steps.

 With specific tailored information about number of steps and distance as a function of time available, participants can plan when, where, and with whom they will be able to obtain the desired number of steps, break goals into manageable portions (at different times throughout the day or week), and thereby increase the likelihood of goal achievement.

 During the App development phase the investigators will demonstrate the App to 5 to 10 older adults to get their input.

 The goal will be to get their feedback about the App features and to make sure it is user friendly.

 The investigators will ask questions about the ease of using the App and their understanding of the App features.

 The interviewer will record their answers to share with the research team and App developer.

 Modifications to the App will be made as needed.

 The investigators will test which components of the program are most successful for increasing step counts.

 The four components of the app can be administered together or separately.

 There are two possible designs for this study, depending on the timing and resources available.

 In the first option, 30 participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: the accelerometer program alone,the accelerometer with the schedule and maps, and the accelerometer with the schedule and maps along with the social network component.

 It is predicted that the complete four component program will be most effective.

 In the second option, which will be implemented if time and resources do not allow for the three group design, 20 older adults will be recruited and all of them will be given the same condition that involves all four components of the App.

 In this case the investigators will look at whether there is improvement in steps over time, but the different App conditions will not be compared.

The goal of this study is to develop a smart phone/tablet app to administer a behavior change program that helps adults to increase daily steps by planning where, when, and with whom to walk.

 The investigators will test the effectiveness of various components of the walking program app for increasing the number of daily steps among sedentary older adults.

 The investigators also will examine the effects on self-efficacy and social integration/support.
