(fifthQuint)A Multimodal Outcome Study of Eating Disorders.

 Participants will learn about the study through flyers, e-mail, and social media (i.

e.

 twitter and Facebook) which will describe the interventional nature of the study,the main eligibility criteria, and the researcher's contact information.

 Interested individuals will be asked to contact the researchers, who will then send an information sheet detailing the study procedure and what participation would involve.

 After reading the information sheet, interested individuals will be contacted by the researchers in order to confirm all eligibility criteria including diagnostic assessment.

 If these are met a PDF of the consent form will be sent to the participants, including information about their rights as participants and their ability to withdraw at any time without having to give a reason.

 Participants who sign the consent form will respond to the email with the attached document.

 Next, researchers will contact the participant to set an appointment to enter the lab for the first EEG recording.

 Before entering the lab, participants will be asked to complete a food diary and complete the complete a battery of questionnaires.

 The questionnaires include: 1) a demographic questionnaire, 2) verbal hunger questionnaire, 3) eating disorders examination questionnaire, 4) food ratings test, 5) self-regulation of eating behaviour questionnaire for adults, 6) The negative urgency scale , 7) the adults eating behaviour questionnaire, 8) GAD-7 anxiety, and 9) PHQ-9 Depression.

 Upon participants' arrival to the lab, they will learn to complete the training tasks (i.

e.

 food specific go/no-go, general go/no-go, emotion task, and arrow flanker task) and perform them during EEG recording.

 They will be offered the opportunity to ask questions relating to the task or the EEG at any time.

 Next, they will discuss the completed food diary with the researcher, who will encourage them to set small weekly goals and plan behaviour towards food, known as implementation intentions.

 Their weight will also be measured.

 Before leaving the lab, participants will take part in a taste test, in which they are asked to rate the taste of particular foods.

 Researchers will monitor intake accordingly.

 Participants will be asked to complete the training and complete food diaries every day for four weeks.

 The food diaries and the successful/ unsuccessful attempts of implementation intentions to reduce craving, bingeing, and purging will be assessed weekly.

 A researcher/clinician will discuss setting the implementation intention goals either on the phone, e-mail, or in person, depending on travel requirements.

 Within the training, visual analogue scales will be used to assess mood and urge to eat.

 Moreover, participants will be asked to weekly report how often they have completed the training within that week.

 At the end of the training, participants will enter the lab to re-complete the four tasks while researchers record brain activation using the EEG.

 They will also discuss their food diaries with the researcher.

 Additionally, their weight will be re-assessed.

 Moreover, they will take part in another taste test, in which they are asked to rate the taste of particular foods.

 Before leaving, they will be asked to complete a feedback sheet in which they can express their experience with the training, in terms of facilitators and barriers and visual analogue scales that will ask participants to rate the acceptability, usefulness and level of burden experienced with training.

 Participants will then be followed up at 1 month post-intervention; they will be asked to complete food diaries and the complete battery of questionnaires used at baseline.

 A Multimodal Outcome Study of Eating Disorders@highlight

This research project aims to explore the effectiveness of a computerised intervention as a treatment for eating disorders, particularly binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.

 Two interventions will be used to target cognitive processes: 1) food-specific inhibitory control training and 2) implementation intentions.

 The full intervention is 4 weeks long and consists of completing the training and food diaries every day and meeting with the researcher twice for EEG recording and taste tests.

 Moreover, it involves completing questionnaires at baseline, at intervention completion, and one month after the intervention.

 Moreover, healthy control participants will be recruitment to complete baseline questionnaires and take part in one EEG recording session in order to assess baseline differences in brain activation in response to computer tasks.
