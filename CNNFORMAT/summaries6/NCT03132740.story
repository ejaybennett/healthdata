(firstQuint)Impact of Three-dimensional Visualization on Operation Strategy and Complications for Complex Hepatic Carcinoma.

 Because of the complexity of complex hepatic carcinoma,the limitations of 2D images of CT/MRI and the uncertainty of surgeons'experience, it is difficult for the surgeons to diagnosis and assess the operation strategy accurately based on traditional 2D imaging(CT/MRI).

The aim of the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three-dimensional visualization on operation strategy and complications for complex hepatic carcinoma.
