(secondQuint)Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Using Heated Versus Room Temperature Ultrasound Gel.

 ED physicians who identify that a patient will require an ultrasound will page the ultrasound team as part of standard of care.

 At that time, an investigator will obtain verbal consent from the patient and provide an information sheet to help explain study details/answer any questions.

 The patient will then be randomized to either warmed gel or room temperature gel.

 Investigators will handle the gel using a heat-resistant glove (ULine Terry Cloth Glove) to maintain blinding to the gel temperature.

 A bedside ultrasound study will then be performed by emergency physicians not otherwise involved in the study using the study gel.

 Immediately upon ultrasound completion, the patients will complete a satisfaction survey.

 The images from the study will be saved and subsequently reviewed by an emergency physician with fellowship training in ultrasound to score image quality from 1 (low) to 5 (high).

 Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Using Heated Versus Room Temperature Ultrasound Gel@highlight

The purpose of this single-blind, randomized control trial will be to investigate whether simply having warmed gel, as compared to room-temperature gel, during a bedside ultrasound significantly improves patient satisfaction scores.
