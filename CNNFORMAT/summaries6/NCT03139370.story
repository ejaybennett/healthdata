(fifthQuint)A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of MAGE-A3/A6 T Cell Receptor Engineered T Cells (KITE-718) in HLA-DPB1*04:01 Positive Subjects With Advanced Cancers.

 Participants found to be be HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors are MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6 positive can participate if all eligibility criteria are met.

 Other tests required to determine eligibility include a physical exam, ECG and ECHO of the heart, CT or MRI scans, and blood draws.

 Eligible participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis.

 These cells are genetically modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-718.

 The desired outcome is that the genetically modified T cells will target tumor cells that express MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6, which are proteins that can be expressed by cancer cells.

 Participants receive chemotherapy prior to the KITE-718 infusion.

 After the KITE-718 infusion, participants will be followed for side effects and have scans performed to see any potential impact on their cancers.

 Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting.

 A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of MAGE-A3/A6 T Cell Receptor Engineered T Cells (KITE-718) in HLA-DPB1*04:01 Positive Subjects With Advanced Cancers@highlight

Participants who are HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors are MAGE-A3/A6 positive may be eligible for this study.

 If eligible, white blood cells are collected by apheresis and genetically modified to recognize cancer cells which express MAGE-A3/A6.

 Chemotherapy precedes infusion of the genetically modified cells.

 Participants may be hospitalized and/or return to the study doctor for check-ups and medical evaluations.

 The purpose of the study is to see if the treatment is safe and effective in treating advanced cancer.
