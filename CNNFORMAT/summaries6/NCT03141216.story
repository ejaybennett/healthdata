(thirdQuint)Effects of Mechanical Ventilation on Pulmonary Electrical Impedance, Diaphragmatic Mobility and Patient-ventilator Synchrony.

 In the immediate postoperative period of cardiac surgery, patients are found under mechanical ventilatory support.

 Commonly, they are ventilated in controlled and assisted-controlled volume (VCV) or pressure (PCV) modes, with weaning at pressure support (PSV).

 Systematic reviews indicate that there is no difference between the VCV and PCV ventilatory modes for some clinical outcomes or that the existing evidence is insufficient.

 The distribution of regional ventilation and diaphragmatic mobility can be measured from the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and diaphragmatic ultrasonography (US) to clarify the physiological changes and / or mechanisms of adaptation of the organism submitted to controlled modes cycled at volume or at pressure and spontaneously flow cycled mode.

 Besides EIT and US measures, gasometric, hemodynamic and respiratory data will also be recorded.

 The statistical analysis will be considered 0.

05 for a statistically significant difference.

 Effects of Mechanical Ventilation on Pulmonary Electrical Impedance, Diaphragmatic Mobility and Patient-ventilator Synchrony@highlight

This study evaluates the effects of VCV, PCV and PSV ventilatory modes during the immediate postoperative period on the variables resulting from regional and global pulmonary electrical impedance and diaphragmatic mobility, as well as perform ventilator synchrony analysis in PSV mode by mechanical ventilator.

 Half of the participants will receive VCV followed by PSV for weaning, while the other half will receive PCV followed by PSV for weaning.
