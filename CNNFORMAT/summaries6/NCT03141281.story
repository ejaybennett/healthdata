(secondQuint)Intervention Comparative Effectiveness for Adult Cognitive Training.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to four training conditions: broad training using either 1) Posit Science's web-based "BrainHQ" or 2) the video game Rise of Nations, or to directed training for 3) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) training on both driving, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)'s web-based older driver training program, and training for fraud avoidance, a web-based tutorial on finance and fraud, or 4) to an active control condition of puzzle solving.

 Training will take approximately 15-20 hr for each treatment condition.

 Before training begins, participants will take baseline ability tests of perception, attention, memory, and cognition, activities of daily living, as well as a driving simulator test for hazard perception, and a financial fraud recognition test.

 They will be tested again on these measures following training completion, and at a one-year follow-up from training completion.

The study will compare the effect of broad and directed (narrow) technology-based training on basic perceptual and cognitive abilities in older adults and on the performance of simulated tasks of daily living including driving and fraud avoidance.
