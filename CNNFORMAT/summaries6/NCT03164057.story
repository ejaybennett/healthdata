(fifthQuint)A Trial of Epigenetic Priming in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 Treatment will consist of 4 blocks of chemotherapy: Induction I, Induction II, Intensification I and Intensification II over approximately 5 months.

 RANDOMIZATION: Patients will be randomized to receive one of two DMTi (azacitidine or decitabine) for 5 days prior to Induction I.

 Intrathecal (ITHMA) treatments will be given right before treatment on this study or on Day 1 of Induction I treatment.

 Leucovorin will be given 24-30 hours following ITHMA.

 INDUCTION I CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide.

 INDUCTION II CHEMOTHERAPY; Patients receive their assigned DMTi for 5 days followed by fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and idarubicin.

 Patients are then evaluated and assigned to either the low-risk arm or the high-risk arm for Intensification therapy.

 INTENSIFICATION I CHEMOTHERAPY - LOW-RISK AML: Patients receive cytarabine and etoposide.

 After administration of 5 days of a DMTi prior to Inductions I and II satisfies a tolerability determination criterion, patients will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to cytarabine and etoposide.

 INTENSIFICATION II CHEMOTHERAPY - LOW RISK AML: patients receive mitoxantrone and cytarabine.

 After administration of 5 days of a DMTi prior to Inductions I and II satisfies a tolerability determination criterion, patients will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to cytarabine and etoposide.

 INTENSIFICATION I CHEMOTHERAPY - HIGH-RISK AML: Patients receive mitoxantrone and cytarabine followed by stem cell transplant (SCT).

 After administration of 5 days of a DMTi prior to earlier courses satisfies a tolerability criterion, patients will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to mitoxantrone and cytarabine.

 INTENSIFICATION II CHEMOTHERAPY - HIGH-RISK AML: Patients who are not referred to transplant will receive erwinia asparaginase and cytarabine.

 After administration of 5 days of a DMTi prior to earlier courses satisfies a tolerability criterion, patients will also receive their randomly assigned DMTi for five days prior to mitoxantrone and cytarabine.

 A Trial of Epigenetic Priming in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

The overall aim of this study is to determine if epigenetic priming with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DMTi) prior to chemotherapy blocks is tolerable and carries evidence of a clinical efficacy signal as determined by minimal residual disease (MRD), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

 Tolerability for each of the agents, as well as total reduction in DNA methylation and outcome assessments will be done to simultaneously obtain preliminary biological and clinical data for each DMTi in parallel.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the tolerability of five days of epigenetic priming with azacitidine and decitabine as a single agent DMTi prior to standard AML chemotherapy blocks.

 - Evaluate the change in genome-wide methylation burden induced by five days of epigenetic priming and the association of post-priming genome-wide methylation burden with event-free survival among pediatric AML patients.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Describe minimal residual disease levels following Induction I chemotherapy in patients that receive DMTi.

 - Estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving a DMTi prior to chemotherapy courses.
