(thirdQuint)In Vivo Characterization of Macrophages in Pediatric Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors Using Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I.

 To establish the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signal characteristics of macrophages in pediatric patients (>= 2 years old) with newly diagnosed malignant brain tumors using ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To correlate the MRI signal of ferumoxytol uptake in macrophages with the number of macrophages in surgical tumor specimen at histopathology.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive a single intravenous infusion of ferumoxytol over 15 minutes.

 After 24 hours, patients undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 Patients will then undergo MRI-localized tissue sampling and tumor resection.

 In Vivo Characterization of Macrophages in Pediatric Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors Using Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI@highlight

This pilot early phase I trial studies how well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates with inflammatory (macrophage) responses in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors.

 If there is good correlation, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI can serve as a noninvasive imaging biomarker of inflammation.
