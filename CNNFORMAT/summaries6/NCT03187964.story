(fifthQuint)Xpert Ultra and Xpert HIV-VL in People Living With HIV.

 Sensitive and rapid point-of-care diagnostics should reduce improve TB treatment outcomes however, tests meeting these criteria have, until recently, been unavailable, especially in PLHIV.

 PLHIV often have early stage TB disease at the time of ART initiation and paucibacillary sputum.

 The current frontline test for TB is the Xpert MTB/RIF, which uses the GeneXpert platform, and is deployed primarily at centralised reference laboratories (Clouse et al.

, 2012; Hanrahan et al.

, 2015).

 This approach has two major limitations: 1) the instruments' far-patient placement likely undermines its potential clinical impact; 2) Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal sensitivity in PLHIV 3) the GeneXpert platform is primarily used only for TB testing and no other assays such as Xpert HIV-1 Viral Load (VL).

 Xpert MTB/RIF will shortly be succeeded by Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra), which promises to increase the speed and sensitivity of TB diagnosis.

 Although Xpert Ultra will doubtlessly improve the detection of symptomatic patients, its greatest incremental benefit will likely arise in patients with low bacillary load (e.

g.

, unselected HIV-positive patients initiating ART).

 Thus, Xpert Ultra has the potential to alter how TB is diagnosed in PLHIV by detecting TB before the disease has a chance to progress and before substantial transmission has occurred.

 The investigators will, in addition to Xpert Ultra on sputum, also perform TB testing using the urinary lateral flow (LF) LAM test, which may detect mycobacteria in asymptomatic PLHIV patients (Lawn et al.

, 2011).

 The use of Ultra on urine from PLHIV as part of preliminary investigation will also be explored.

 The polyvalent utility of the GeneXpert hardware platform is, however, hitherto largely unexplored despite the widespread deployment of machines.

 HIV VL testing is currently done in South Africa according to the National HIV Treatment guidelines, which advise measuring HIV VL every six months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter.

 HIV VL testing involves collection of a blood sample, transporting it to a centralised laboratory for VL quantification, reporting the result back to the clinic, and calling the patient back.

 If HIV VL is found to be over 1000 genomes per ml, the patient may not be adherent to the prescribed ART or may have drug-resistant HIV and, now that a failure of virologic suppression has been confirmed, the patient may be asked to give a second blood sample for drug susceptibility testing and may have a counselling visit scheduled, in order to improve the patient's adherence.

 There is, however, a large amount of discretion at local clinics as to what constitutes virologic failure and patients with increased VL may still receive these interventions, even if below the 1000 genomes per ml threshold.

 The investigators also intend to perform Xpert HIV-1 VL testing and, compared to patients who receive the standard-of-care of centralised VL testing, evaluate the proportion of patients without virologic suppression who are referred to a follow-up intervention (DST and/or adherence counselling).

 The investigators propose a study which implements Xpert Ultra (in unselected PLHIV) and Xpert HIV-1 VL (in PLHIV on ART) in Cape Town, South Africa.

 Furthermore, the GeneXpert platform's polyvalent feasibility, time-to-result and -treatment (Xpert Ultra and LF LAM), and effect on interventions to improve VL (Xpert HIV-1 VL) will be examined.

 Xpert Ultra and Xpert HIV-VL in People Living With HIV@highlight

TB is increasingly diagnosed using the GeneXpert platform, which can be used for a variety of tests (not just TB).

 HIV viral load monitoring is required at least annually in patients on ART to detect failure of virologic suppression, however, most HIV VL testing is done in a central lab.

 If a patient has virologic failure, these patients are more likely to get TB.

 The investigators wish to see if Xpert done at the clinic results in faster patient TB diagnosis and treatment initiation compared to sending specimens away to a central laboratory.

 In a different patient group (PLHIV returning for HIV treatment monitoring), the investigators wish to see if POC Xpert HIV-1 viral load (Xpert VL) monitoring results in faster patient viral load quantification compared to sending patient specimens to a centralised laboratory.

 Both POC tests will use the same testing hardware.

 This polyvalent utility of the GeneXpert system is hitherto uninvestigated in this local setting.

 Newly diagnosed pre-ART HIV positive patients will be approached and asked to be a part of this study.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to Ultra done at the clinic or the normal off-site laboratory TB testing.

 The time taken for patients to get diagnosed and how long it takes to start treatment will be recorded.

 Additionally, a different group of HIV positive patients (on ART) returning to the clinic for annual follow-up visits will also be asked to join the study.

 These patients will be randomly selected for either Xpert VL testing done at the clinic or the normal off-site laboratory VL testing.

 The time taken for patients to receive viral load results will be recorded.

 The time taken for patients to have ART regimen adjusted, receive adherence counselling or received HIV drug susceptibility testing will be recorded should the patient's viral loads be found to be higher than anticipated and considered by the clinical to indicate a lack of viral suppression.

 This project will confirm if Ultra TB testing performs well in PLHIV irrespective of symptoms, and may produce evidence that supports universal TB testing in this important and vulnerable patient group.

 The investigators will also assess whether POC placement of Ultra and Xpert VL has benefits (e.

g.

, more patients diagnosed for TB or VL monitored during the same day visit).
