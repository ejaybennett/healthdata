(fifthQuint)Dental Stem Cells and Bone Tissue Engineering (CELSORDINO).

 This project aims to develop a new pre-vascularized tissue engineered bone construct, using human cells of a simple and non invasive tissue source: dental pulp.

 We will isolate mesenchymal stem cells from dental tissue of wisdom teeth, extracted from patients aged between 13 and 17 years old.

 The objectives are: (i) to assess in combination the endothelial differentiation and osteoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (immature third molar); (ii) to study the boosting effect of the conditionned medium on cell differentiation and production of a prevascularized bone construct.

 The differentiation will be monitored by evaluation of biosynthesized matrix, bone mineralization (immunohistochimie, Westen Blot), histological response (Von Kossa, Alizarin Red) and presence and quantification of pseudo-vascular structures (angiogenesis assay), compared to reference value (commercial differentiation medium).

The main limitation in bone regeneration is the lack of vascularization of the newly shaped tissue.

 The main objective of this project is to check if the simultaneous differentiation of dental mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoblastic and endothelial lineage permits to obtain a new pre-vascularized tissue engineered bone construct.

 We will then evaluate the boosting effect of the conditionned medium on cell differentiation and production of a prevascularized bone construct.
