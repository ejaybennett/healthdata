 Effect of Ghrelin on Decision-Making@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of the "hunger hormone" ghrelin on human decision-making.

 Participants will be given an injection of ghrelin or saline on different study days and will then be asked to make a series of computer-based decisions.

 The investigators hypothesize that ghrelin will increase participant's preference for energy-dense foods and will also increase impulsiveness in decision making.
