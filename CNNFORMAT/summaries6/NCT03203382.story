(secondQuint)Corneal Nerve Structure in Sjogren's.

 Patients with either suspected or confirmed diagnosis of Sjogren's disease will be recruited to participate.

 Participation will involve the completion of a brief survey (the OSDI), corneal evaluation with an aesthesiometer, corneal staining with fluorescein and lissamine green, and finally measurement of tear-film breakup time.

 In addition, participants will have their corneal nerve morphology evaluated with the Heidelberg confocal microscope and finally they will have a blood draw performed to assess vitamin D level.

 Corneal Nerve Structure in Sjogren's@highlight

Patients who are suspected of or diagnosed with Sjogren's disease will be evaluated for ocular symptoms and corneal nerve morphology.

 We are specifically interested in the relationship between Vitamin D level and aberrations in the morphology of the corneal nerves.
