 Patients can write and read Thai language Exclusion criteria 1.

Clinical unstability 2.

Confusion and delirium 3.

0.

 After patients sign inform consent we will record baseline characteristics, assess baseline Numerical rating scale (NRS), emotional status (ThaiHADs), Quality of life status (FACT-G).

 All patients will do the 25 MCQs test within 30 minutes before intervention.

 Video group will watch video 10 minutes and conventional group will receive pain education from trained nurse in the same period.

 The knowledge includes cancer pain definition, cancer pain management, pain assessment and role of patients in cancer pain management.

 After finishing intervention patients will the same 25 MCQs test (30 minutes) and patients can ask questions to the trained nurse.

 All patients will be educated to record pain diary everyday for seven days.

 All patients will receive standard pain management from the physicians.

 At the day seven we will assess NRS, ThaiHADs and FACT-G and finish the study.

 Pain Education to Improve Cancer Pain Management Patients@highlight

Cancer pain is one of the problems of treating cancer pain.

 Although, there is a WHO analgesic ladder to improve this problem, it is still inadequate pain control.

 Pain does not affect only physical but also emotional and quality of life.

 From review literatures we found that patients' knowledge about cancer pain management is inaccurate; for example, fear to use opioid, try to patience of pain, concerning only cancer treatments, which can cause of unfavorable pain management outcome.

 Therefore, we will conduct the RCT of using pain education by video comparing to conventional face to face pain education by nurse in hospitalized cancer pain patients.

We will use 25 MCQs examination for testing pre-post intervention to test level of understanding of patients.

 The measurements are NRS, ThaiHADs and FACT-G at the first and last day of study.

 We expect that NRS should improve more than 50% at the seven day of study.
