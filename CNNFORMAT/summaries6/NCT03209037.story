(fifthQuint)The Changes of CD8+T Cells Frequency and Function During Antiviral Therapy.

 Pegylated interferon -2a(Peg-IFN-)and Nucleoside analog(ue) drugs can inhibit viral replication , but Peg-IFN- also play an important role in immune regulation.

 In hepatitis B infection, CD8+T cells are the main effector cells in adaptive immune response.

Peg-IFN- recommended as the first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and even HBsAg disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which may be related to the functional activation of CD8+T cells in the case of hepatitis and the function enhancement of CD8+T cells during Peg-IFN- therapy.

 This study was aimed at investigating the changes of CD8+T cells frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during Peg-IFN-and nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.

Meanwhile, the investigators want to explore whether the decline of HBsAg and HBeAg resulted in recovery of CD8+T cells function, or recovery of CD8+T cells function led to the decrease of HBsAg and HBeAg.

 Several studies demonstrated that HBsAg and HBeAg could damage CD8+T cells function, and the loss of HBsAg and HBeAg led to recovery of CD8+T cells function.

Pegylated interferon -2a(Peg-IFN-) not only inhibit viral replication, but also play an important role in immune regulation, while Nucleoside analog(ue) drugs only inhibit viral replication.

 In hepatitis B infection, CD8+T cells are the main effector cells in adaptive immune response.

 This study was aimed at investigating the changes of CD8+T cells frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during Peg-IFN-and nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.

Meanwhile, the investigators want to verify whether Peg-IFN- suppressed the virus and the reduction of virus led to the recovery of CD8+T cells function, or Peg IFN - alpha enhanced CD8+T cells function which gave rise to the decline of the virus.
