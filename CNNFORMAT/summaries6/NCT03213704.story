(thirdQuint)Larotrectinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With NTRK Fusions (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial).

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in pediatric patients treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) with advanced solid tumors (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders harboring NTRK 1/2/3 fusions.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders with NTRK 1/2/3 fusions.

 II.

 To obtain additional information about the tolerability of LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

 III.

 To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive larotrectinib orally (PO) or via nasogastric- or gastric-tube twice per day (BID) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Larotrectinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Histiocytic Disorders With NTRK Fusions (A Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial)@highlight

This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well larotrectinib works in treating patients with solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders with NTRK fusions that have spread to other places in the body and have come back or do not respond to treatment.

 Larotrectinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
