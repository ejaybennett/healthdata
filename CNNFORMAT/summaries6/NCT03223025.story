(fifthQuint)Comparing Efficacy and Safety of CinnaGen Biosimilar Growth Hormone (CinnaTropin) Versus Nordilet in Children With Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency.

 This study was a national, single center, randomized, active-controlled, two-arm, cross-over clinical trial to compare efficacy and safety of CinnaTropin(R) with Novo Nordisk growth hormone product in children with Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency (IGHD).

 After signing the written informed consent, patients were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of CinnaTropin(R) or reference product (0.

03mg/kg/day).

 Patients were admitted to receive the medication based on planned treatment.

 After three months patients were switched to receive the other product for another three months.

 Treatment visits were monthly for both groups.

 The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of CinnaTropin(R) with Novo Nordisk growth hormone product.

 The secondary objectives of this study are to further evaluation efficacy and safety.

 During the trial, if patients bone age reached 14 and the improvement in their height was less than 2.

5 cm than last year or, they did not reach the desired height appropriate for their age and gender or, if the growth plates were closed and they couldn't reach appropriate adulthood height, treatment will be discontinued.

 The clinical trial was according to procedures that incorporate the ethical principles of GCP.

 Accurate and reliable data collection was assured by verification and cross-check of the CRFs against the patient's records by clinical monitors (source document verification was performed), and the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the center.

 A comprehensive validation check program was used to verify the data, and discrepancy reports were generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.

 Determination of sample size was based on the mean growth velocity of 9.

71.

3 following treatment with growth hormone and under consideration of 80% power, a sample size of 6 patient in each group was calculated.

 By considering patient loss and in order to increase the statistical power of the study a sample size of 15 patients in each group was determined.

 Comparing Efficacy and Safety of CinnaGen Biosimilar Growth Hormone (CinnaTropin) Versus Nordilet in Children With Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency@highlight

This randomized, active-controlled, two-armed, open-label, and cross-over trial was designed to compare efficacy and safety of 0.

03 mg/kg/day subcutaneous injections of either CinnaTropin(R) or Novo Nordisk growth hormone product in 30 children with Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency.

 Patients were randomized to receive one of the products for three months.

 After that, each patient crossed over to the other arm to receive the other product for another three months.

 The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of CinnaGen growth hormone (GH) with Nordilet.

 The secondary objectives of this study were further comparison and evaluation of efficacy along with safety between CinnaTropin(R) and Nordilet(R).
