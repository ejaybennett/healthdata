(fifthQuint)The ILERVAS Project: Assessing the Prevalence of Subclinical Vascular Disease and Hidden Kidney Disease.

 Study design and population: a randomized interventional study with 2 arms that will include 14,600 individuals with at least one CV risk factor, registered in Primary care in the province of Lleida, between January 2015 and December 2017, who will subsequently be followed up until January 2027.

 The ILERVAS study data will be available on www.

 Source of information and instruments for data collection: sociodemographic variables (age, sex and race), medical history of comorbidities and medical treatments will be collected from the electronic Primary Care medical history (e-CAP).

 The Mobile Unit (MU) has the equipment to perform all explorations of the study.

 In addition, variables such as physical exercise (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), diet (PREDIMED), and daytime somnolence (Berlin questionnaire and the Epworth somnolence scale) will be collected.

 Participant selection: from a total of 410,246 people with an open history in the e-CAP (on October 24, 2014), the study population that meets the inclusion criteria will be identified.

 Of these, a total of 14,600 people (7300 in the intervention group and 7300 in the control group) will be selected through simple randomization without replacement, within clusters defined by basic healthcare area, primary care (PC) center or doctor's office, in accordance with the total number of people who may be visited in the MU during one year period.

 The participants of the selected intervention group will be informed of the study objectives and the diagnostic tests to be performed by means of a personalized letter with an appointment day and time.

 Prior to the inclusion in the study they must sign the informed consent form.

 The study protocol has been approved by the Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova (Lleida) Ethics Committee.

 One month before the MU reaches each population, 2 investigators responsible for the project will travel to explain the project to healthcare workers and administrators of the different healthcare basic areas; and to help with the interpretation of the results of the examinations and recommendations that will be included in the ILERVAS final report in the electronic medical history of each patient which are based on clinical practice guidelines.

 Follow-up period: as this is an asymptomatic population with a low-moderate CV risk, a minimum 10-year follow-up period has been established to observe the onset of CV events.

 Initially the cohort will be followed up from January 2015 to December 2027.

 The follow-up period may be lengthened, given that all data will be recorded in the e-CAP.

 The population selected will be monitored every six months to collect changes in medical history.

 Cardiovascular events and CKD progression: the onset of a CV event will be recorded according to the 10th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which includes: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysm, revascularization and angioplasty of any artery region.

 Likewise, the patient's cause of death, whether of CV origin (myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, aortic aneurysm, mesenteric infarction or sudden death) or of non-CV origin (infections, cancers, accident or kidney disease) will be recorded.

 The information sources used to identify CV events will be: review of medical records (through the e-CAP) and consultation of the Catalonia mortality registry.

 CKD progression is defined as a doubling of creatinine or entry into renal replacement therapy, and will also be collected through the e-CAP.

 Clinical and Biochemical data: the following variables will be recorded: weight, height, waist circumference and neck circumference, body mass index in kg/m2, hours of fasting, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (mmHg).

 Blood pressure will be measured 3 times (Omron 6(R)) at 2-min intervals and the mean of the last 2 will be collected.

 Dried capillary blood testing (fingertip puncture) will be used to determine creatinine, uric acid and total cholesterol, using the Reflotrons(R) Plus system (Roche).

 In cases in which total cholesterol is greater than 200 mg/dl, the complete lipid profile (HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) will be determined using Cobas B 101(R) system, Roche.

 Non-HDL cholesterol levels, glycated hemoglobin (Cobas B 101 system, Roche), the CKD-EPI glomerular filtration rate will be determined as well.

 Albuminuria and albumin/creatinine ratio will be determined in urine sample from spontaneous micturition collected in the MU using Clinitek Microalbumin 2 Reagent Strips and a Siemens Clinitek Status(R) analyzer.

 Artery ultrasound: the examination and reading will be performed by 2 nurses specialized in vascular imaging diagnostics, following a standardized protocol with the patient in supine decubitus.

 The VIVID I version BT12 ultrasound system (GE Healthcare) will be used.

 The system has a 12L-RS/4-13 MHz linear probe (carotid and femoral arteries), a 4C-RS/1.

5-6 MHz convex probe (abdominal aorta) and a 3SRS/ 1.

5-2.

5 MHz sector probe (transcranial).

 It also has a module for measuring intima-media thickness and pulsed Doppler ultrasound to assess hemodynamic abnormalities in the case that atheromatous plaques are present, and also to analyze the intracranial circulation.

 The DICOM network connectivity system will be used to record the results and ultrasound images online in the e-CAP.

 Carotid arteries: a total of 8 vascular regions will be analyzed (common carotid, bifurcation or bulb, internal carotid and external carotid), with the patient in supine decubitus and the head turned 45 towards the opposite side in the examination.

 The transversal examination will be started with a 2D longitudinal seccion of the common carotid up to the bifurcation.

 At this level, color Doppler will be used to distinguish the external carotid from the internal carotid and then examine both carotids simultaneously.

 The presence of an atheromatous plaque will be identified as an intima-media thickness with a height greater than 1.

5 mm.

 In case of presence of plaque, the degree of stenosis (155/ 220 cm/s for the medial cerebral artery, 120/155 cm/s for the anterior cerebral artery, 100/145 cm/s for the posterior cerebral artery and the basilar artery, and 90/120 cm/s for the vertebral artery).

 Ankle-brachial index: a continuous Doppler (Hadecco ES100X MiniDop(R)), sphygmomanometer and blood pressure cuffs (Riester minimus III(R)) will be used.

 Systolic blood pressure will be measured in the brachial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery in both limbs.

 The ratios between tibial and pedal systolic blood pressure in each leg and the higher brachial blood pressure will be calculated.

 The final value for each limb will be the lower value of those obtained between tibial and pedal blood pressure.

 An ankle-brachial index value 1.

4 will be considered to be suggestive of arterial rigidity.

 Spirometry: it will measure forced vital capacity (FVC); forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); the ratio between FEV1 and FVC and the lower limit of normality, as a percentage.

 Determination of advanced glycation end products: they will be measured using skin autofluorescence (SAF) in the forearm with the AGE Reader system(R) (Diagnoptics, the Netherlands).

 SAF is measured using spectrophotometry which is calculated as the relationship of the intensity of reflected light compared to refracted light.

 The result obtained will be divided into 4 CV risk groups, taking into account age and sex.

 Atrial fibrillation screening: The presence of atrial fibrillation will be assessed with the SRA device(R) (EVINA Health Solutions) for one hour in the MU.

 Biobank: drawing of blood samples from a peripheral vein of the hand or forearm to obtain serum, plasma, DNA and RNA will be collected.

 Samples will be prepared in aliquots following a standardized protocol, and sent frozen (dry ice) to a centralized biobank (IRBLleida Biobank, Spain) for processing and storage for subsequent studies.

 Moreover, urine samples will be frozen and stored in the IRBLleida biobank for subsequent studies.

 Statistical analysis: descriptive analysis will include absolute and relative frequencies for the qualitative variables, means and standard deviations for the continuous variables that follow a normal distribution, and median and interquartile range in the cases that do not follow a normal distribution.

 Their distribution will be analyzed with the chi-squared test, in the case of qualitative variables, and Student's t test or ANOVA for quantitative variables with a normal distribution, or, failing this, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used for those without a normal distribution.

 The correlation between quantitative variables will be analyzed using Pearson's or Spearman's test, depending on the distribution.

 The existence of collinearity between 2 variables will be analyzed to enter the variable that better predicts the result variable in the multivariate model.

 Multivariate analysis will be performed using logistic regression if the dependent variable is qualitative or linear regression if it is quantitative.

 Beta regression coefficients, odds ratios (ORs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals will be estimated as measures of association.

 In the longitudinal study, the incidence of CV morbidity and mortality and mortality due to any cause will be analyzed, based on the diagnostic tests used in the MU and the biomarkers studied using Cox regression.

 Statistical significance will be set at a p value < 0.

 The ILERVAS Project: Assessing the Prevalence of Subclinical Vascular Disease and Hidden Kidney Disease@highlight

Background and Objectives: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerosis are 2 interrelated diseases that increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

 The objectives of the ILERVAS project are: (1) to determine the prevalence of subclinical arterial disease and hidden kidney disease; (2) to assess the impact of early diagnosis of both diseases on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and also on the progression of CKD; (3) to have a platform with clinical data, vascular imaging and biological samples to define a personalized cardiovascular risk profile.

 Methods: Randomized intervention study.

 From 2015 to 2017, 14,600 people (7,300 in the intervention group and 7,300 in the control group) aged between 45 and 70 years without a previous history of cardiovascular disease and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor will be randomly selected from the primary health care centers across the province of Lleida, Spain.

 A team of experts will travel around in a mobile unit to carry out the following baseline tests on the intervention group: artery ultrasound (carotid, femoral, transcranial and abdominal aorta), ankle-brachial index, spirometry, determination of advanced glycation end products, atrial fibrillation screening, dried blood spot and urine spot tests.

 Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected and stored in the biobank to identify new biomarkers using omics studies.

 Participants will be followed up until 2027 to assess whether the intervention group has any changes on medical treatments and lifestyle changes.

 In addition, the incidence of cardiovascular events will be compared between the intervention and control groups.
