(fifthQuint)Comparison of Home-Based Exercise on the Posterior Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Symptoms.

 Study Objective: To compare the efficacy of the self-Epley manoeuvre to the Brandt-Daroff exercise in resolving vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

 Study Design: Single-blind randomized controlled study Sample Size: Fifty patients were recruited in the study and were divided with 25 patients in each treatment arm.

 Study Method: Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and have given informed consent were randomized into the 2 treatment groups.

 A dedicated physiotherapist will demonstrate the selected exercise (either SEM or BDE) and observed the patient performing the exercise twice to ensure the ability of the patient to perform it correctly at home.

 A diary was provided for the patients to chart the therapy sessions performed at home as well as a pamphlet with simple illustrated instructions of the chosen exercise.

 The patients were asked to perform the home-based exercise for 2 weeks.

 Primary Outcome Measure - Resolution of vertigo symptoms in patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV.

 Secondary Outcome Measures - Vertigo resolution at 1 and 6 months; - The conversion of positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test between both groups after 1 month; - Vertigo intensity in unresolved vertigo patients at 1 & 6 months; - The Dizziness Handicap Inventory between both groups at 1 and 6 months.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder in adults and the treatment of choice is by particle repositioning manoeuvres (PRM).

 This study aims to compare the treatment efficacy of two home-based exercises, self-Epley manoeuvre (SEM) and Brandt-Daroff exercise (BDE) in patients with posterior canal BPPV based on vertigo resolution, reduction of vertigo intensity, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores and the conversion of a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test.
