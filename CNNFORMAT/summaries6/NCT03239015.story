(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor With Druggable Molecular Event.

 The individuals recruited in the present study are with solid tumor, mainly including two parts: first, rare tumor without standard recommended treatment such as atypical fibrous histiocytoma; second, common tumor after multiple line of therapy such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, etc.

 All patients have no any standard therapy based on NCCN guideline when recruiting.

 Next-generation sequence was used to detect druggable molecular event including gene mutation, gene fusion, amplification, etc.

 Then patients with molecular events were treated with corresponding targeted drug and followed-up, and not limited tumor type.

 The efficacy and safety of targeted drug were evaluated.
