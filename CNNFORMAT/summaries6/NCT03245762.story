(thirdQuint)Intranasal Oxytocin for Infants With Prader-Willi Syndrome.

 The overall objective of this Phase 2 trial is to compare the change from baseline to morning of day 6 of Internasal Oxytocin (IN-OT) on suck and swallow competency in infants/children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) who are in nutritional phase 1a.

 Study Hypothesis 1: The Study team hypothesize that replacing Oxytocin (OT) in infants and children who are in nutritional phase 1a will improve their suck and swallow, potentially even eliminating the need for gastrostomy tubes and nasogastric tubes for feeding, and decreasing the risk of aspiration with oral feeding.

 Study Hypothesis 2: The Study team hypothesize that replacing OT in infants and children with PWS will result in improved eye contact, daytime alertness, and feelings of bonding between the parents and the infant.
