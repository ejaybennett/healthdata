(thirdQuint)the Effects of Cerebral Collateral Circulation on the Outcome of Leukoaraiosis in High-risk Population.

 1.

 Case collection information is sent daily to clinical trial supervisors.

 2.

 The clinical trial team meets once a week to monitor the quality of clinical trials.

 3.

 The severity of the leukoaraiosis will be evaluated by a scale.

 The patients whose score is more than 2 will take additional magnetic resonance examination including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and arterial spin labeling (ASL).

 And their cognitive ability will be evaluated by a series of scales including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and gait by the short physical performance battery (SPPB).

 The blood sample will be taken for biochemical detection and hair and nail samples for trace element detection.

 4.

 Data were analyzed by regression analysis.

 the Effects of Cerebral Collateral Circulation on the Outcome of Leukoaraiosis in High-risk Population@highlight

This study observed the relationship between cerebral collateral circulation and the prognosis of leukoaraiosis in high-risk population.

 Cerebral collateral circulation and leukoaraiosis levels will be evaluated and followed up by magnetic resonance examination.

 The participants' clinical performance caused by leukoaraiosis will be assessed by a series of scales.
