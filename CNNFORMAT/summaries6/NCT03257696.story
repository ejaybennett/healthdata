(fifthQuint)Yes/No Questionnaire for Aphasic Patients (YNQ).

 In France, about 130,000 persons per year are victims of stroke.

 Thirty percent of the victims suffer from aphasia during the acute phase.

 These language impairments have an impact on caregiving.

 In the context of post-stroke aphasia, the most relevant means of verbal communication is closed-ended questioning.

 However, the available tools do not allow a professional consensus and the comprehensive assessment tools for aphasia do not provide any indication of the reliability of patients' answers.

 The investigators have developed a tool, the yes/no questionnaire that consists of 10 closed-ended questions designed to assess the patient's ability to provide a coherent answer.

 During one year, successive patients taken care in the neurovascular unit at la Rochelle hospital will be assessed for eligibility to the study and their relative will be informed and ask for consent.

 Aphasic patients will therefore answer the yes/no questionnaire.

 Based on the speech therapist evaluation, patients will be classified as "reliable respondent" or "unreliable respondent".

 Yes/No Questionnaire for Aphasic Patients (YNQ)@highlight

Quality of care depends strongly on oral communication with patients.

 Stroke patients, who have language disorders, have understanding difficulties, but also have difficulties in expressing their needs and in being understood.

 Available tools do not allow a professional consensus on the assessment of patients' ability to answer reliably to questions asked by caregivers.

 The investigators propose an answer reliability assessment tool based on yes or no questions.

 The goal of the present study is to define an optimal score for defining the test positivity, as a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and by emphasizing the negative predictive value.
