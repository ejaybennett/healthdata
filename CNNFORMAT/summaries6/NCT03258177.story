(fifthQuint)Virtual Visits (Utilization of Virtual Care in Postoperative Patients to Improve the Patient Experience).

 Participants will be randomized to complete either a postoperative follow-up visit using virtual care technology or by attending a standard in-person visit at the clinic.

 The virtual visit uses a camera-enabled device and internet access to provide live access to the medical professional.

 Surveys to assess patient satisfaction and convenience will be administered by email on the day of the postoperative follow-up visit.

 Additional information including demographics, hospital encounters within 30 days of surgery, length of time of the follow-up visit, travel cost and time, whether additional follow-up care is required, and complications after surgery will be collected to evaluate postoperative virtual care visits.

 Subject participation in the study will end after follow-up care is complete or at 30 days, whichever occurs last.

 Virtual Visits (Utilization of Virtual Care in Postoperative Patients to Improve the Patient Experience)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate postoperative virtual care visits for patients who undergo a laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or robotic cholecystectomy.

 The investigators aim to better understand whether postoperative virtual care visits will not result in a greater composite measure of the occurrence of hospital encounters within Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) for the 30 days following surgery than standard in-person clinic care.

 The investigators also aim to better understand whether postoperative virtual care visits provide time and cost savings, and provide equal or improved patient satisfaction and convenience.
