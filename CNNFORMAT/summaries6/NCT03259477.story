(secondQuint)RFR Change of Precise Segmental Versus Complete Renal Arterial Clamping During LPN for Clinical T1 RCC.

 Renal functional reserve (RFR) describes the capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase glomerular filtration rate(GFR) from baseline in response to stimuli (e.

g.

, protein load).

We hypothesized that renal functional reserve may be better in patients with clinical T1 renal cell carcinoma(RCC) undergoing laparoscopic partial(LPN) nephrectomy with precise segmental renal artery clamping than those with complete renal arterial clamping.
