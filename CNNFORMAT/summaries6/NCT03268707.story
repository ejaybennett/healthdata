(secondQuint)Influence of an Innovative Telemetric Smartphone Application on Re-hospitalization.

 The telemetric smartphone application includes a digitized medical record, a mobile ECG device and a 24-hour on call service by a cardiologist.

 The hypothesis is that the use of a telemetric smartphone application can reduce re-hospitalization in patients after cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation.

 Secondary endpoints are quality of life measurements, health care cost calculations and recurrences of atrial fibrillation after ablation.

 All patients will undergo ablation and will be randomized into two groups: 1) conventional follow up with outpatient visits 6 and 12 months after ablation compared to 2) a structured follow up with the smartphone application, a mobile ECG device (patients will be able to send in as many ECGs as wanted), up to three phone calls with a cardiologist (24-hour on call service) as well as outpatient visits 6 and 12 months after cryo-ablation.
