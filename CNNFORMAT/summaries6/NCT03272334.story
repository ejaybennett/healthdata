(fifthQuint)Her2-BATS and Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via leukapheresis procedure.

 Depending on arm/schedule, about 4-5 weeks later, study treatment will begin.

 For HER2 BATs, the white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2 -- which activates the cells to multiply.

 After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and trastuzumab/Herceptin (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs).

 Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

 Follow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the last dose of Pembrolizumab.

 Her2-BATS and Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

This proposal uses HER2Bi armed activated T-cells (HER2 BATs) to target breast cancer in combination with pembrolizumab (PBZ) in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

 Phase I will determine a safe dose of the combination of PBZ and HER2 BATs in 3 to 18 patients.

 In the phase II portion, an additional 12 patients will be treated at the selected dose to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy.

 Study treatment includes a combination of 8 infusions of BATs using a previously established schedule and one to three infusions of PBZ (200 mg per dose).

 PBZ will be added to 8 infusions of BATs in 3 schedules: #1) after the 8th BATs infusion; #2) after the 4th and 8th BATs infusions; and then, #3) before the 1st and after the 4th and 8th BATs infusions.
