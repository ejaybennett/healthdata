(thirdQuint)Endometriosis Biomarker Discovery Study.

 This study will be a prospective collection of blood, urine, and endometrial tissue from women with chronic pelvic pain symptoms, with or without infertility, who require evaluation by laparoscopy.

 Women undergoing laparoscopy for elective tubal ligation will also be investigated similarly and serve as the negative control.

 Subjects will be queried regarding sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, pain and lifestyle as well as assessment for differential diagnoses such as interstitial cystitis and idiopathic bowel syndrome.

 Endometriosis severity will be captured by rASRM staging during laparoscopy.
