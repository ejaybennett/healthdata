(thirdQuint)Lung Cancer Registry for Lung Cancer Patients.

 Investigators intend to build an electronic database which will record the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, molecular data and treatment parameters of lung cancer patients (NSCLC and SCLC) who are referred to a tertiary Oncology Clinic.

 Documentation will include: a) Patient demographics, co- morbidities, tobacco exposure in pack-years, b) Disease related parameters: method of diagnosis, histological type, disease staging (according to 7th edition of TNM for lung cancer) and metastatic sites if any, c) Molecular status: mutation status for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFRor cMET), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), proto-oncogene B-Raf, and Programmed-Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing when available, d) Type of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immune-therapy), and Line of treatment (neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, palliation therapy), e) Clinical outcome: Overall Survival (OS), Response Rate (RR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS).

 Lung Cancer Registry for Lung Cancer Patients@highlight

In the light of a new era in the management of lung cancer this non-interventional study intend to capture all the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, molecular and treatment parameters of non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) lung cancer patients from a tertiary Oncology Clinic in an Electronic Data Base (EDB).
