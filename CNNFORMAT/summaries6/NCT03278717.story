(thirdQuint)Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Maintenance Olaparib and Cediranib or Olaparib Alone in Ovarian Cancer Patients.

 ICON9 is an international multicentre randomised, phase III trial assessing maintenance treatment with olaparib and cediranib or olaparib alone in women with relapsed ovarian cancer whose disease progressed more than 6 months after first line chemotherapy.

 Women whose disease responds to platinum chemotherapy following 3 to 4 cycles can be registered for collection of germline BRCA test results if known, and somatic BRCA testing of archival tumour specimens or secondary debulking tissue if required.

 Patients who have completed treatment and whose disease has responded (partial or complete) to a minimum of 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy will be randomised to maintenance treatment of either olaparib and cediranib or olaparib alone.

 The maintenance regimen may be continued beyond radiological progression until trial closure if the patient is deemed to still be deriving clinical benefit, but must be discontinued once subsequent treatment is instituted.

 Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Maintenance Olaparib and Cediranib or Olaparib Alone in Ovarian Cancer Patients@highlight

ICON 9 will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of maintenance olaparib in combination with cediranib compared to maintenance olaparib alone following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer.

 Prognostic and predictive factors will be studied from tumour and blood samples.
