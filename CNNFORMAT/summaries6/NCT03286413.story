(secondQuint)Comparison of Microwave Ablation With Cryoablation for Breast Tumor.

 A total of more than 200 patients diagnosed with benign breast lesions and 50 patients with malignant breast lesions in two centers of China will be recruited in this study and underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA and cryoablation treatment.

 Information for each patient includes demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla.

 Ablation variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications; reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival will be compared and analyzed.
