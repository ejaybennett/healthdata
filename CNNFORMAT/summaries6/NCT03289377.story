(thirdQuint)NRC:Improving Healthcare for Cognitively Impaired Elders and Their Caregivers.

 Two waves of APNs (25 each wave/total 50) will receive RDAD training and be queried pre and post- training using both qualitative and quantitative procedures to determine: (1) Is RDAD training successfully received by advanced practice nurses? (2) Do they report it as relevant to improving the care they deliver to persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)? (3) Does RDAD training of advanced practice nurses improve their level of knowledge about ADRD, their skills in providing ADRD care, and their level of confidence in providing this care? A subset of advanced practice nurses (5 per wave, total of 10) will be recruited to implement RDAD as part of their ongoing care of persons with ADRD.
