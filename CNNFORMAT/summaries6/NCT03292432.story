(fifthQuint)Triggered Escalating Real-time Adherence (TERA) Intervention.

 This is a phase II, two-arm, randomized, open-label study.

 Eligible participants will have failed first-line ART therapy, defined as having detectable HIV virus (HIV-1 RNA 200 copies/ml) within 45 days of enrollment despite having been on ART for at least 24 weeks.

 Participants will be stratified by age (18 years of age) and randomized in equal proportions to receive the study intervention (TERA) or standard of care (SOC), with no enrollment limits in each stratum.

 TERA is a time-limited (12 weeks) intervention approach that (a) uses wireless electronic dose monitoring (EDM) to identify dose-times passing with no bottle opening, (b) sends a text asking about the delay, (c) evaluates response to text and (d) initiates follow-up by an adherence coach depending on response and if the bottle remains unopened for a designated period post dosing.

 Phone based outreach will use problem solving discussion with an adherence coach, who can use an agreed-upon contact tree to reach the youth through other individuals.

 This "boot camp" strategy is used to unsettle or disrupt established non-adherence behaviors and factors promoting ongoing non-adherence.

 The TERA intervention will be compared with standard of care (SOC).

 Participants will be followed for 48 weeks, with clinic visits at entry and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48.

 Audio computer assisted self-interviews (ACASI) are conducted every 12 weeks to collect information on adherence, motivation and skills, social support, mental and physical health functioning.

 Viral loads, medication and medical histories are also collected at each study visit.

 The primary objective of the study is to compare HIV-virologic suppression (VLS) rates at 12 weeks.

 Secondary objectives include comparing VLS rates and EDM rates of ART adherence at 24, 36, and 48 weeks as well as patterns of adherence over time.

 Triggered Escalating Real-time Adherence (TERA) Intervention@highlight

Youth Living with HIV (YLWH) often face unique challenges achieving high and sustained rates of adherence to their antiretroviral therapy (ART).

 Poor adherence can lead to unsuppressed virus, more advanced HIV disease and poorer health outcomes, eventually exhausting treatment options.

 To date however, there are few demonstrated interventions for youth failing first line therapy.

 This study will evaluate a novel intervention that uses remote coaching through video enabled counseling sessions, a 'smart' pill bottle that notifies an adherence coach when youth fail to open/close the device around dose time, and problem solving outreach by the coach when and as needed.

 This intensive 'boot camp' strategy is implemented for 12 weeks followed by observation through 48 weeks.
