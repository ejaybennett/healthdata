(secondQuint)Variability of Whole Blood Clotting Time Measurements in Ex Vivo Human Blood Samples Spiked With Anticoagulants.

 Twelve healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years (6 subjects per spiking anticoagulant) will be enrolled.

 A total of 8 blood samples (12 mL/sample) will be collected by direct venipuncture.

 The samples from will be spiked with predetermined concentrations of edoxaban or enoxaparin (baseline, saline control and 6 specified concentrations of anticoagulant).

 Each blood sample will be tested for whole blood clotting time (WBCT), Point of Care activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT).

 Variability of Whole Blood Clotting Time Measurements in Ex Vivo Human Blood Samples Spiked With Anticoagulants@highlight

The study will assess the distribution and variability of whole blood clotting time (WBCT) measurement in human blood collected from healthy volunteers that is untreated and spiked with predetermined concentrations of edoxaban or enoxaparin.
