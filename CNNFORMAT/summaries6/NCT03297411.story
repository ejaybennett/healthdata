(firstQuint)Clinical Outcomes With Electroconvulsive Therapy: Insights From Computational Modelling.

 This study will differentiate the brain regions which are related to the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment, from the brain regions associated with memory impairment, with ECT stimulation.

 This will be done by 1) testing effects on memory of 4 different forms of ECT, which stimulate the brain differently; 2) in a subset of participants, use computer modelling to assess the pattern of brain stimulation with the 4 forms of ECT, and match these results to memory outcomes.
