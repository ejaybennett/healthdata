(firstQuint)EVAS2 IDE Prospective, Multicenter, Single Arm Safety and Effectiveness Confirmatory Study.

 This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Nellix System among a wide range of physicians and in consecutively enrolled subjects to assess safety and effectiveness outcomes.

 Following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB approval the Nellix(R) EndoVascular Sealing System will be implanted into eligible patients who are adequately informed and have consented to join the study.

 Enrolled patients will undergo a high resolution, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant aortic and aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at specified follow-up intervals post-implantation.

 Follow-up visits will occur at 30 days, 6 months, and annually to 5 years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted devices, and relevant laboratory test results.
