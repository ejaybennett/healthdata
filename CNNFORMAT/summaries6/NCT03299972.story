(fifthQuint)Resistance Exercise and Whey Protein Supplementation to Combat Age-related Sarcopenia.

 With demographics indicating that the world's population aged >60 years will increase from 600 million reported in 2000, to >2 billion by 2050, there is an increasing interest in health issues related to ageing.

 One area of particular interest is sarcopenia, defined as the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function as a consequence of ageing.

 Sarcopenia has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, poor metabolic and cognitive function, reduced quality of life and early mortality.

 Studies have reported beneficial effects of both resistance exercise and increasing protein intake independently and in combination on markers of sarcopenia (mostly increases in muscle mass, strength and physical function).

 However, little is known about the effects of combined intervention on chronic inflammation as well as metabolic, cognitive and endocrine function.

 This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial will investigate these, alongside assessing the effects of combined intervention on total lean tissue mass, muscular strength and functional performance.

 Resistance Exercise and Whey Protein Supplementation to Combat Age-related Sarcopenia@highlight

The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial is to investigate the effects of 12 weeks resistance exercise and whey protein supplementation on multiple markers of sarcopenia in older men.

 Generally healthy, retired men aged 60-80 years will be recruited (n = 52 in total, n = 13 per group).

 Participants will be randomised to either: a) control group [placebo only], b) whey protein supplement group, c) resistance exercise + placebo group or d) resistance exercise + whey protein supplementation group.
