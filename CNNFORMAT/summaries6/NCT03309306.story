(thirdQuint)Evaluating Household Food Behavior With a Smartphone App.

 Investigators will improve measurement via the development of the FoodImage smartphone app, a technology leveraging the investigators' expertise in creating and deploying apps to measure food intake and deliver nutritional interventions in free-living household conditions.

 Investigators will validate the app against weighed waste in a controlled laboratory setting.

 The study will yield an app ready for future study deployment while analyses of the data will inform rapidly evolving policy discussions concerning optimal approaches to reduce food waste.

 These outcomes align with program priorities to understand the economics of food waste and to use behavioral economics to address consumption behavior.

 Specific objectives include: 1.

 Development of FoodImage, a smartphone app that measures household food waste and food-waste-related behaviors, 2.

 Assess differences in the accuracy and time burden of measurements taken with the FoodImage app versus current household food waste measurement approaches (a pen-and-paper diary) 3.

 Use the FoodImage app in a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of reducing household food waste through behavioral nudges in the form of personalized feedback about food waste levels and household-specific reduction goals.

 Evaluating Household Food Behavior With a Smartphone App@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the use of a smartphone app as a way to measure food waste.

 Investigators propose to improve the accuracy and convenience of household food waste measurement so that consumer food waste program evaluations yield more power, less bias, less measurement error, and greater representation of targeted populations.
