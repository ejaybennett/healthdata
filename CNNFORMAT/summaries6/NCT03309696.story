(fifthQuint)Regulating Homeostatic Plasticity and the Physiological Response to rTMS.

 Background and Rationale: The aim of this study is to determine how existing non-invasive neuromodulation devices affect brain physiology as measured by EEG recording.

 Currently, the use of non-invasive neuromodulation is rarely guided by a detailed knowledge of how neural activity is altered in the brain circuits that are targeted for intervention.

 This gap in knowledge is problematic for interpreting response variability, which is common.

 To address this gap, the current proposal aims to combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different frequencies.

 Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a key determinant of whether rTMS induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD).

Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies.

 In a physiological investigation of health subjects, we aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery.

 The justification for this study is that controlling homeostatic plasticity can reduce subject variability and the knowledge gained can be used to optimize rTMS delivery.

 What is needed to move the field forward is a method for combining tDCS and rTMS and for measuring neuronal responses directly which we aim to establish in this study.

 The pilot study project will examine the targeted effects of neuromodulation in normal subjects.

 The brain regions targeted for intervention include auditory areas in the temporal cortex (TC) that process sounds and functionally connected regions of the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) that mediate sensory habituation.

 We aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery.

 The protocol also includes an exploratory aim to examine physiological changes in patients with tinnitus who only receive active stimulation, however, the exploratory aim is not part of the pilot physiological investigation.
