30 Expected research results: The implantation rate in frozen embryo transfer group which vitrified at 2PN stage is higher than fresh embryo transfer.

 The pregnancy rate in frozen embryo transfer group which vitrified at 2PN stage is higher than fresh embryo transfer.

 This study is only data analysis, no additional collection of samples.

 This study does not involve vulnerable groups.

 A Comparison of Clinical Outcomes of Warmed Embryo Vitrified at 2PN Stage and Fresh Embryo Transfers@highlight

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between fresh embryo and frozen embryo transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF).

 All frozen embryo was vitrified at pronuclear stage (2PN) and cultured to cleavage embryos for transfer.

 This is a retrospective study.

 All IVF cycles were included in this study and further divided into fresh and frozen embryo transfer groups.

 The collection data including: stimulation protocols, medicines, blood test results, pregnancy test and all clinical data.

 The primary outcome is pregnancy rate and secondary outcome is implantation rate.
