(thirdQuint)Optimal Protein Dose Per Meal During Weight Loss in Perspective to Maintaining Muscle Mass.

 Aim of this project is to determine the optimal protein dose (high quality milk protein) per meal in relation to enhancing muscle protein synthesis and thereby counteract muscle loss during weight loss.

 The hypothesis is that the optimum dose of protein for women on a hypocaloric diet will be greater than when women eat an energy sufficient diet, and also higher than the optimal dose previously determined in weight stable men.

 Methods: Forty women (~ 50 years) will be randomized to four groups.

 Following a five day hypocaloric diet (three groups) or an energy balanced diet (one group).

 The women will report to the laboratory to ingest one of three different protein doses.

 The muscle protein response to the different doses of protein will be determined by the muscle protein fractional synthetic rates using tracer kinetics.

 Optimal Protein Dose Per Meal During Weight Loss in Perspective to Maintaining Muscle Mass@highlight

The primary aim of the trial is to determine the optimal dose of protein per meal in relation to enhancing muscle protein synthesis and thereby in perspective counteract muscle loss during weight loss.

 In addition, we aim to determine whether the response to protein intake is reduced in women on hypocaloric diet compared to in women on an energy-balanced diet.
