(secondQuint)Intraosseous With Intra-articular Injection of Platelet Rich Plasma in Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis.

 Methods Eighty-six patients from January 2015 to June 2015 with grade II to grade III knee osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification were randomly divided into 3 groups to receive either PRP or HA.

 Group A received intra-articular injection of PRP 2 ml combination with medial tibial plateau and medial femoral condyle injection of PRP 2 ml (once more 2 weeks later).

 Group B were treated with 2 ml of PRP intra-articular injection every 14 days for a total of two injections.

 Group C received intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid 2 ml every 7 days for five injections.

 All patients were evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score before the treatment and at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th months.
