(fifthQuint)The Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone and Thiamine in Patients With Septic Shock Trial.

 The investigators plan to conduct a feasibility pilot prospective, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, trial in ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the intravenous administration of high dose Vitamin C (6g/d), Thiamine (400mg/d) and Hydrocortisone (200mg/d) for a maximum of ten days leads to a more rapid resolution shock and vasopressor dependence.

 Hypothesis: Treatment with a combination of intravenous Vitamin C, Thiamine and Hydrocortisone reduces duration of vasopressor (measured by hours alive and vasopressor free) use censored at 7 days compared to standard care with Hydrocortisone alone.

 This is a prospective, feasibility, pilot, multi-centre, randomised, open-label controlled trial.

This study will be performed in seven Victorian ICUs in Australia.

 Patients admitted to any ICU of the participating hospitals with the primary diagnosis of septic shock will be screened for inclusion into this study.

 Rationale: A large body of experimental data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous vitamin C attenuate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduce the endothelial injury characteristic of sepsis (thereby reducing endothelial permeability and improving microcirculatory flow), augment the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhance vasopressor responsiveness.

 In animal models these effects have resulted in reduced organ injury and increased survival.

 However, their effect in critically ill humans is unknown.

 Randomisation: ICU patients will be enrolled as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after fulfilling the criteria for septic shock.

 Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment group, receiving intravenous Vitamin C (1.

5g every 6 hours), Thiamine (200mg every 12 hours) and Hydrocortisone (50mg every 6 hours), or to the control group, receiving Hydrocortisone (50mg every 6 hours) alone.

 Treatment allocation will occur using a computerized system and concealed allocation.

 The clinical staff involved in patient care will administer the additional drugs to those allocated to the treatment arm of the trial as soon as possible after the identification of septic shock and randomization and always no later than 2 hours after randomization.

 Patients readmitted to ICU during the same hospital stay will not receive any further doses of study drugs.

 Study Treatment will continue until: - Septic shock resolves - The patient leaves the ICU - Contraindications to Vitamin C, Thiamine or Hydrocortisone therapy arise - Death occurs - A maximum of 10 days of treatment has been administered - Serious adverse events suspected to be secondary to the intervention therapy develop.

 Study Drugs This study will be an open label study: Intervention group: - 1500mg Vitamin C is will be diluted in 100ml of Normal Saline (0.

9% NaCl) and infused over 1 hour.

 The dosing schedule is 1500mg every 6 hours for the duration of study treatment.

 - 200mg Thiamine will be diluted in 100ml of Normal Saline (0.

9% NaCl) and infused over 1 hour.

 The dosing schedule is 200mg every 12 hours.

 Patients in the control group of the study can receive thiamine if clinically indicated at the discretion of the attending ICU staff specialist.

 In both groups (treatment and control), patients will be treated with hydrocortisone 50mg IV q 6 hourly for the duration of study treatment.

 After shock resolution and/or a maximum fo 7 days Hydrocortisone will be tapered off over 3 days.

 Statistical analysis Assuming a mean (SD) duration of vasopressor dependency of 50 (28) hours, the investigators estimated a required sample size of 120 patients (60 per group) to identify a clinically relevant decrease of vasopressor dependency and an increase in days alive and vasopressor free at 7 days of 25% (20 hours) (i.

e.

 increase from 41 to 55 hours of days alive and vasopressor free at day 7) with a power of 90% at an alpha level of 0.

 The investigators have chosen this outcome because it has been previously used in ICU studies as an appropriate outcome of pilot research in septic shock to indicate resolution of septic vasoplegia.

 In this study, it is also directly relevant to the known biology and physiology of the intervention applied in the pilot study.

 Finally, the investigators have chosen a very conservative effect size which is about a third of the effect reported in a recent comparative trial of this intervention.

 To account for an estimated drop-out rate of approximately 5%, the investigators plan to include 126 patients in total (63 patients per group).

 The major ethical issues associated with this study relate involve the recruitment of participants who are dependent on medical care and in need of immediate intervention for the management of life-threatening haemodynamic instability.

 1.

 Informed consent from participant or substitute/medical treatment decision maker: Where possible, and as authorised by law, which varies between jurisdictions, consent will be obtained from the participant himself or from the participant's legal surrogate if the patient lacks decision-making capacity.

 2.

 Consent to continue: Where it is not possible or practicable for the patient or the legal surrogate to consider the study and give consent immediately, the patient may be enrolled with a waiver of consent (or medical research procedures in an emergency in Victoria) and consent obtained from the participant's legal surrogate as soon as possible, provided the procedure is in accord with the requirements of the site's Human Research Ethics Committee and applicable legislation.

 When appropriate, the participant's legal surrogate, and, in turn, the participant, will be informed of the study and will be able to withdraw consent for ongoing participation at any time.

 3.

 Once subjects are recovered and are able to consider the information sheet, they will be offered the opportunity to withdraw from study follow-up.

 The Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone and Thiamine in Patients With Septic Shock Trial@highlight

The global burden of sepsis is substantial with an estimated 15 to 19 million cases per year and the vast majority of these cases occur in low income countries.

With more timely diagnosis and improvement in supportive care the 28-day mortality from sepsis in high income countries has declined to about 25%, however, the mortality from septic shock remains as high as 45%.

 Moreover, the mortality from sepsis and septic shock in low income countries is reported to be as high as 60%.

 New therapeutic approaches to sepsis are required; considering the global burden of sepsis these interventions need to be effective, cheap, safe and readily available.

 A large body of experimental data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous vitamin C attenuate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduce the endothelial injury characteristic of sepsis (thereby reducing endothelial permeability and improving microcirculatory flow), augment the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhance vasopressor responsiveness.

 Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a feasibility pilot prospective, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, trial in 126 ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the intravenous administration of high dose Vitamin C (6g/d), Thiamine (400mg/d) and Hydrocortisone (200mg/d) leads to a more rapid resolution shock and vasopressor dependence.
