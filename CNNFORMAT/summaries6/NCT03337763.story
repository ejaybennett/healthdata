(thirdQuint)A Prospective Pilot Study (BIO|SELECT Pilot).

 Enrolled patients will undergo the baseline medical tests to assess the cardiac functions (e.

g.

 echo, blood test, and 12-Lead ECG) prior to the implantation of Biotronik CRT-D and QP lead featured with MultiPole Pacing parameter.

 At implantation, LV-LV conduction delays are measured in predefined LV pacing and sensing configurations.

 One month after the successful implantation, the patients revisit the investigation site to be adjudicated for programming MultiPole pacing or continuing bi-ventricular pacing mode, based on their echo readings by then.

 Patients are subsequently followed up at four and seven month post implantation to acquire the LV-LV conduction delays and echo readings, etc.

 at the time.

 A Prospective Pilot Study (BIO|SELECT Pilot)@highlight

Enrolled patients implanted with Biotronik CRT-D and QP lead equipped with MultiPole pacing mode is grouped into which programmed into MultiPole pacing, or conventional bi-ventricular pacing mode.

 They are followed up by seven month post implantation, and predefined cardiac functional parameters are collected at each visit.
