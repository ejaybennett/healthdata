(secondQuint)Stomatognathic System Assesment, After Different Methods of Establishing the Centric Relation.

 In the study subjective experiences of patients, wearing complete dentures, were compared.

 Two different methods of determining a centric relation were performed: the traditional method using wax occlusal rims and the Gerber method, based on gothic arch tracings.

 The success rate of establishing a centric relation in both methods was evaluated (rentgenodiagnostics).

 The influence of the method used to obtain the centric relation on patients stomatognathic system (condyle centralization, pain) was also evaluated.

 The comparison between two methods was performed and results were analyzed.

 A centric relation was analyzed in temporomandibular joints and a corelation between TMD symptoms and centric relation was evaluated.
