(fifthQuint)Silver Doped Ceramic Coated Orthopedic Implants.

 In this study, considering the differences in bone contact surface area and interactions; hip joint prostheses, intramedullary nails and external fixator implants to be used in 30 patients .

 CE (European Conformity) marked, domestic manufactured standard orthopedic implants will be used in patients after silver HA coating with electrospray method.

 These patients will be tasted for the evaluation of liver and kidney functions and blood and urine silver levels in addition to routine tests such as full blood, complete biochemistry, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate required in the normal diagnosis and treatment processes, and will be monitored for at least 12 months.

 The performance of coating to be applied and any unwanted side effects in normal conditions of use will be evaluated.
