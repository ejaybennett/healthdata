(thirdQuint)Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate Followed by Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate and Combined With Entecavir in Chronic Hepatitis B.

 Chronic hepatitis B(HBV) has a high prevalence (>8%) in China.

 Entecavir, aguanosine analog, is a potent and selective inhibitor of HBV DNA polymerase.

 Glycyrrhizin has been used for more than 30 years in the treatment of liver diseases in Asian countries, who can relieve necro-inflammatory and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis Recent study has shown that inflammation plays the important role in chronic HBV and fibrosis or cirrhosis disease progression, but antiviral therapy only may not reduce inflammation ideally.

 The addition of glycyrrhizin to entecavir in the treatment may slow disease progression in patients with chronic HBV and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
