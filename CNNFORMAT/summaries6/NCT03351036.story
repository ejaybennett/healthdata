(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the S3 Guideline on Avoidance of Perioperative Hypothermia - Already a Standard or Wishful Thinking?.

 Perioperative hypothermia is a common problem in todays surgical and anesthesiological patient care and is associated with many adverse events such as impaired coagulation, increased risk for wound infections and patient discomfort among others.

 The intention of this study was to evaluate the current S3 guideline on the avoidance of perioperative hypothermia published in 2014 concerning its implementation in the clinical routine.

 In a first phase the current status should be recorded.

 If this reveals an inappropriate high incidence of perioperative hypothermia training arrangements shall be taken for non-physician personnel in the PACU in a 2nd phase of the project.

 The third phase is intended to evaluate the effect of the training arrangements on the incidence of hypothermia.
