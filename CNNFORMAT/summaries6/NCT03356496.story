(fifthQuint)Preoperative Self-managed Respiratory Therapy for Reduction of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.

 Postoperative pulmonary complications account for >50% of all adverse postoperative events and are more costly and carry greater comorbidity than cardiac complications.

 Much research has been performed to identify potential risk reduction strategies for PPCs.

 Until recently all of these focused on intraoperative and postoperative interventions, including lung-protective mechanical ventilation, lung expansion techniques, and use of regional anesthesia and analgesia.

 In the last few years several studies have investigated the potential role of preoperative interventions to improve respiratory status.

 These studies have demonstrated benefit from preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT).

 A recent systematic review found that any preoperative intervention, such as education, IMT, exercise training or relaxation reduced PPC rates.

 However, these studies have focused on cardiothoracic and abdominal surgery, and almost all have utilized respiratory therapist-directed interventions.

 Likely due to the additional costs and difficulty of arranging respiratory therapy on an outpatient basis, this promising new risk mitigation strategy has yet to be adopted on a large scale.

 Oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) devices offer a potentially easier and less costly preoperative respiratory intervention.

 OPEPs are a drug-free, easy to use, hand-held device with a pressure-oscillation dynamic that provides intermittent resistance and creates positive pressure and oscillations simultaneously.

 It opens weak or collapsed airways to mobilize and assist mucociliary clearance to the upper airways where it can be coughed out.

 This study evaluates the hypothesis that providing preoperative, patient self-directed respiratory therapy with use of an OPEP device will reduce the incidence of PPCs in patients with increased pulmonary risk undergoing any major, non-cardiothoracic surgery with general anesthesia.

 Preoperative Self-managed Respiratory Therapy for Reduction of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications@highlight

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are a source of much morbidity and mortality.

 Rates of PPCs exceed 30% in patients with multiple risk factors.

 Several studies have demonstrated reduced PPCs in patients who underwent preoperative inspiratory muscle training.

 These studies largely focused on cardiothoracic surgery and required the use of respiratory therapists.

 The investigators hypothesize that preoperative, self-administered respiratory therapy would reduce PPCs in patients with risk factors for PPCs undergoing any non-cardiothoracic surgery.

 This study is a randomized, controlled trial comparing preoperative use of an oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device with usual care in patients undergoing non-emergent, non-cardiothoracic surgical procedures under general anesthesia.
