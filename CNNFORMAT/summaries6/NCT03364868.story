(fifthQuint)GPPAD-POInT (Global Platform of Autoimmune Diabetes - Primary Oral Insulin Trial).

 The GPPAD-POInT-Study aims to determine whether daily administration of oral insulin to children from age 4 months - 7 months with elevated genetic risk for type 1 diabetes reduces the cumulative incidence of beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes in childhood.

 The purpose of the GPPAD-POInT-Study is to induce immune tolerance to beta-cell autoantigens through regular exposure to oral insulin for a period of 29 to 32 months.

 Together with the results of the currently ongoing Pre-POINT-Early Study, this phase IIb study aims to investigate and consolidate the findings from the pilot Pre-POINT Study, namely safety and immune efficacy at a daily dose of 67.

5 mg oral insulin.

 Since babies and young children will be tested in the GPPAD-POInT-Study, the 67.

5 mg dose will be reached by dose escalation starting at 7.

5 mg for 2 months, followed by exposure to 22.

5 mg for 2 months, and reaching the desired 67.

5 mg dose.

 The GPPAD-POInT-Study aims to recruit 1040 children into the trial.

 The active substance for oral application is human insulin.

 Oral Insulin will be applied as a capsule containing 7.

5, 22.

5 and 67.

5 mg of the active substance together with filling substance microcrystalline cellulose.

 GPPAD-POInT (Global Platform of Autoimmune Diabetes - Primary Oral Insulin Trial)@highlight

The GPPAD-POInT Study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multicentre, multinational primary prevention phase IIb study aiming to induce immune tolerance to beta-cell autoantigens through regular exposure to oral insulin for a period of 29 to 32 months.

 The hypothesis is that regular exposure to oral insulin throughout the period in life where beta-cell autoimmunity usually initiates will tolerize against insulin and train the body's immune system to recognize the treatment product without reacting adversely to it in a manner seen in children who develop T1D.

 This immune tolerance induction therapy would reduce the likelihood of beta-cell autoimmunity.

 The study objective is to determine whether daily administration of oral insulin from age 4 months - 7 months until age 3.

00 years to children with elevated genetic risk for type 1 diabetes reduces the cumulative incidence of beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes in childhood.
