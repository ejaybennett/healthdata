 Hypotheses and Aims Hypotheses: Hypothesis #1: The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the molecular mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and differentiate it from other inflammatory disorders by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptomics.

 Hypothesis #2: The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based immunologic analysis will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular evolution of acute and chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in protective immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease.

 The discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

 Specific Aim #1: To identify the mechanisms specific for GI acute GVHD and delineate it from other inflammatory disorders.

 Objective 1: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis on T cells purified from GI tissue samples taken from patients who undergo endoscopy for presumed GI GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional gastrointestinal disease (FGID).

 Objective 2: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptome analysis on T cells from the peripheral blood at the time of endoscopy in patients diagnosed with GI GVHD, IBD, and FGID.

 Specific Aim #2: Characterize the immunologic dysregulation responsible for acute GVHD, chronic GVHD and defects in protective immunity in patients undergoing HCT.

 Objective 1: Perform longitudinal immune analysis on T cells and B cells purified from patients undergoing allogeneic HCT who develop acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and infectious complications post-transplant and compare to patients without these complications.

 Objective 2: Perform microbiome analysis longitudinally in patients undergoing HCT to determine the impact of microbiome alterations in the development of post-transplant complications.

 Background and Significance Allogeneic HCT is an effective treatment for patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases.

 However, this treatment is complicated with high rates of morbidity and mortality limiting its broader application.

 The leading causes of post-transplant morbidity and mortality include acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and infectious disease.

 The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems approach to understanding the mechanisms driving these complications, such that evidence-based treatment strategies can be devised.

 Acute GVHD: Acute GVHD is mediated by donor-derived allo-reactive T cells becoming activated and resulting in cytotoxicity against host cells as well as cytokine-mediated tissue damage.

 Moderate to severe acute GVHD can occur in up to 60% of patients undergoing HCT and the more severe forms have been associated with mortality rates >50%.

 The most common sites of the immune-mediated tissue damage are the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

 GI GVHD occurs in 40-50% of HCT patients and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality from this disease.

 The diagnosis of GI GVHD is derived from clinical and histopathological findings.

 GVHD can occur in both the upper and lower GI tract leading to symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia.

 Histopathological diagnostic criteria for GI GVHD includes identification of crypt cell apoptosis, crypt destruction and/or mucosa denudation.

 Unfortunately, the severity of GVHD on histology is poorly correlated with the clinical course of the disease.

 While GI GVHD is a common complication following HCT there remain many barriers to its consistent and accurate diagnosis.

 First, diagnosis is dependent on appropriate tissue sampling.

 Visible lesions are frequently absent8 and endoscopic findings can be diffuse and nonspecific.

 There is also no consensus on the optimal location of the GI tract for biopsies or number of biopsies needed to secure a diagnosis.

 There is also frequent discordance between biopsy specimens from the upper and lower GI tract.

 Second, patients presenting early in the course of GVHD may have subtle histopathological findings that may be missed or not yet present.

 At the onset of GVHD few apoptotic cells may be seen and crypt loss and mucosal damage may yet to have occured.

 Lastly, there are also confounding factors that can lead to the misdiagnosis of GVHD that include conditioning regimen related toxicity, concomitant infections, and medications which can all cause focal inflammation of the GI tract.

 In the first 20 days following a myeloablative conditioning regimen diffuse apoptosis can be seen mimicking acute GVHD10.

 Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus infections can also have similar clinical and histopathological presentations.

 Use of mycophenolate mofetil and proton pump inhibitors have also been found associated with GI tract apoptosis that can be misdiagnosed as GVHD.

 All of these factors lead to the high degree of inter-observer variability in the histological diagnosis of GVHD and poor correlation with the clinical observations, illustrating the need for more sensitive and specific methods of diagnosis.

 There have been recent advances in the identification of biomarkers in GVHD that have diagnostic and prognostic significance.

 IL-8, IL-2 receptor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), elafin, regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha (reg-3alpha), TIM3, IL-6, ST2, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), IL-33, CXCL10, and CXCL11 have all been found to have utility in predicting the development of GVHD.

 While these biomarkers have been identified they have not been extensively validated and are yet to be clinically adopted as a guide to alter treatment.

 Moreover, the biomarkers discovered thus far are often the result of downstream pathway perturbations and discovering the upstream dysregulation that occurs earlier in the course of the disease may be valuable in developing diagnostic or prognostic models that could lead to trials aimed at altering the natural course of the disease.

 The Investigators have previously shown that by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, and whole transcriptome analysis, we can identify previously unrecognized molecular pathways active in GVHD.

 The Investigators anticipate that by utilizing a systems immunology approach in patients with acute GVHD they will be able to identify pathways that have diagnostic and prognostic value.

 This may enhance our diagnostic capacity and most importantly, allow us to individualize management of patients based on their specific immunologic profiles.

 Chronic GVHD: CGVHD occurs in 40-60% of transplant patients with the incidence of this disease rising in the past 2 decades.

 25 chronic GVHD causes significant mortality, and in those patients that survive, it can result in profound effects on quality of life.

 Despite the increased frequency of chronic GVHD, accurate diagnosis and evidence-based therapy is still lacking.

 Thus, while chronic GVHD biomarkers have been identified there have yet to be any that qualify for clinical application.

 Moreover, these biomarkers often represent end-stage pathway perturbations and may result from nonspecific inflammation and tissue damage as well as counter-regulatory mechanisms.

 In addition to the challenges in diagnosis, there are significant treatment challenges as well: Thus, treatment of chronic GVHD has not changed significantly over the past few decades.

 First line therapy remains corticosteroids with or without calcineurin inhibitiors (CNIs) and unfortunately, approximately 50% of patients will fail and require second line treatment with failure-free survival at 2 years following second-line therapy being only 25%.

 These data underscore the significant unmet needs in this field, both for molecular diagnostics and evidence-based treatment paradigms.

 Protective Immunity: In addition to the challenges of acute and chronic GVHD, patients undergoing HCT face other toxicities as well, many of which are related to dysfunctional immune reconstitution after transplant.

 However, although the phenomenology of the many defects in protective immunity (both against infectious pathogens and against leukemia relapse) is well-documented, the causative molecular mechanisms remain unknown.

 To address these questions, the investigators and others have begun to perform detailed assessments of immunologic reconstitution after HCT including the application of new T Cell Receptor (TCR) and B cell Receptor (BCR) deep-sequencing technologies.

 These technologies allow the investigation of the breadth and depth of post-transplant immune reconstitution at a level of molecular detail not previously possible and hold the promise of deepening our understanding of the impact of infectious pathogens on global immune health and immune reconstitution.

 The widespread application of these technologies, and their intersection with detailed assessment of immune phenotype and function can provide novel insights about the state of immune health in transplant patients, and holds the promise of identifying patients in need of novel interventions to improve their post-transplant immune reconstitution.

 The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes post-transplant.

 This approach will deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment paradigms for transplant patients.

 This approach will deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment paradigms for transplant patients.

 This research study will examine the immunology of different gastrointestinal disturbances such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder (FGID).

 The Investigators want to know why and how people develop these gastrointestinal disturbances using blood and tissue samples in order to better predict and treat the disease process.

 The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and differentiate it from other inflammatory disorders by using advanced immunologic analysis.

 The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based immunologic analysis will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular evolution of acute and chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in protective immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease.

 The discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).
