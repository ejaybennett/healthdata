(fifthQuint)Effect of Levocarnitine Supplementation for the Management of Fatigue in Levothyroxine-Treated Hypothyroid Patients.

 It has been well-established now-a-days that, some chronic diseases impose generalized weakness, lethargy, lassitude amounting from degrees mild, moderate to a severe one to total incapacitation on the part of the patients.

 Hypothyroid patients instate of receiving adequate thyroid hormone replacement, experience fatigue-related symptoms.

 Carnitine is a non-essential amino acid synthesized endogenously from essential amino acids- lysine and methionine with in the body involved in long chain fatty acid transportation to the mitochondrial membrane.

 Carnitine- transportation system is essential for production of energy at cellular level.

 Thyroid hormone plays an important role in carnitine-dependent long chain fatty acid transport and oxidation.

 Some available reports suggest that, Levocarnitine supplementation produced potentially favourable effects on fatigue-related symptoms in hypothyroid patients although still awaits confirmation.

 The present study is an attempt to investigate into the effects of Levocarnitine supplementation on fatigue in patients with hypothyroidism.

 Effect of Levocarnitine Supplementation for the Management of Fatigue in Levothyroxine-Treated Hypothyroid Patients@highlight

It has been observed that despite administration of apparently adequate thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroid patients, many of them experience persistent fatigue and fatigue-related symptoms.

 Carnitine transports long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria whereupon the high energy source (ATP) becomes synthesized.

 Levocarnitine administration reduced fatigue related symptoms in hypothyroid patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement.

 The present study deals with alleviation of fatigue in hypothyroid patients by carnitine supplementation.
