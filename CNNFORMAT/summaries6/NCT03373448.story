1 Study design The study will be a prospective multicentre randomized, examiner blinded controlled clinical trial of 24 months duration.

 Change in mucosal inflammation will be reported after 6 months while the true endpoint parameters i.

e.

, peri-implant attachment will be reported after 1 and 2 years.

 4.

2 Treatment allocation and blinding Patients will be allocated either to test (Labrida BioClean(R) or control (titanium curettes) treatment by computer-generated block randomization to ensure equal sample sizes.

 The examiners will be blinded to the treatment allocation.

 4.

3 Study setting In total six centres will be included.

 Patient screening, inclusions and all clinical examinations will be performed by a board-certified specialist in periodontology, registered dental hygienist or specialist in prosthetics at each centre.

 Treatments will be performed by a dental hygienist or a board-certified specialist in periodontology.

 4.

4 Patients 40 patients (20+20) diagnosed with mild to moderate peri-implantitis, defined as peri-implant bone loss 2 -4 mm, will be included by each clinician participating in the study.

By each clinician participating in the study; 40 patients (20+20) diagnosed with mild to moderate peri-implantitis, defined as 2-4 mm peri-implant bone loss, will be randomized to either test treatment with Labrida BioClean(R) or control treatment with titanium curettes.

 In total 240 patients (120 test and 120 controls) treated by 6 clinicians at 6 centers will be included in the study.
