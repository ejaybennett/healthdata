(fifthQuint)Long Term Follow up of Subjects Exposed to Genetically Engineered T Cell Receptors.

 This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who have received lentivirus-mediated genetically engineered T Cell Receptors in an Adaptimmune sponsored clinical trial.

 The study is designed in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance on gene therapy trials.

 The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Adaptimmune clinical studies.

 The study will include subjects who have received various T cell receptors including but not limited to MAGE-A10T and MAGE-A4T.

 Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation (i.

e.

, new medical history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer therapies and investigational products in other clinical studies) with careful attention to adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or lentivirus-induced diseases.

 Blood samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of cells with lentiviral vector sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and chemistry and hematology laboratory assessments.

 Subjects will be followed for survival.

 Long Term Follow up of Subjects Exposed to Genetically Engineered T Cell Receptors@highlight

Subjects who previously took part in an Adaptimmune study and received genetically changed T cells (including but not limited to MAGE-A10T and MAGE-A4T) are asked to take part in this long term follow-up study.

 Subjects will be asked to join this study once they complete the parent interventional study.

 The purpose of this study is to find out if the genetically changed T cells that subjects received in the parent study have any long-term side effects.

 No additional study drug will be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being followed for long term safety in this study.

 For a period of 15 years starting from last administration of the genetically changed T cells, subjects will visit their study doctor for a check-up and to have blood tests to look for any changes that might have happened because of the genetically changed T cells.
