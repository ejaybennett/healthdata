(thirdQuint)Characterizing the Intestinal Hormonal Secretion in Non-obese, Obese and Non-obese Patients After Bariatric Surgery.

 Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) impose a significant burden of morbidity on many individuals around the world.

 In recent years, the enteroendocrine cells system with its diverse hormones (Glucagon, GLP-1, GIP and others) was increasingly recognized as a key player in obesity and DM homeostasis.

 Bariatric surgery induces weight loss as well as an improvement in glycemic control often leading to diabetes reversal and occasionally to postprandial hypoglycemic events.

 The aim of the study is to characterize the composition and secretory profile of enteroendocrine cells in the obese, non-obese and non-obese post bariatric surgery.

 Characterizing the Intestinal Hormonal Secretion in Non-obese, Obese and Non-obese Patients After Bariatric Surgery@highlight

The enteroendocrine system is composed from different cells along the different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, secreting diverse hormones and bariatric surgery alters intestinal hormone secretion, affecting glycemic control and weight.

 The aim of the study is to characterize the composition and secretory profile of enteroendocrine cells in the obese, non-obese and non-obese post bariatric surgery.
