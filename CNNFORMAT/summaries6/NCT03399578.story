(firstQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity of a Candidate MERS-CoV Vaccine (MERS001).

 All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly.

 Each volunteer will receive one vaccination in total.

 There are three different vaccine schedules: Group 1 (n=6) will receive 5 x 10^9 vp ChAdOx1 MERS .

 Group 2 (n=9) will receive 2.

5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

 Group 3 (n=9) will receive 5 x 10^10 vp ChAdOx1 MERS.

 The study will assess the safety of the vaccines, and the immune responses to the vaccinations.

 Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

 Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford, England.
