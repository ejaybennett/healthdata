(firstQuint)Video Versus Conversational Contraceptive Counseling During Maternity Hospitalization.

 This was a multi-center randomized, controlled trial examining contraceptive counseling in the setting of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) uptake and immediate provision.

 At two urban public hospitals with large adolescent populations, participants were randomized to a structured, in-person conversation with a trained counselor or a 14-minute video providing the same information.

 Both participant groups were provided written materials and both had the opportunity to ask questions of the counselor.

 The total time to complete counseling was measured, as well as participant satisfaction, pre- and post-intervention contraceptive knowledge, and intended postpartum contraceptive method.
