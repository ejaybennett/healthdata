(secondQuint)Prone Position Impact in ARDS Patients on the Incidence of Central Venous Catheter Colonization.

 Catheter-associated infection prevention is achieved by identification of the population at risk.

 Patients receiving prone position Under acute respiratory distress syndrome appear to be particularly vulnerable.

 This retrospective study is designed to compare the risk of catheter colonization that could be induced or worsened by prone position.

 Knowing that, prone position is increased into the care acute respiratory distress syndrome since few years.

 Unfortunately, no study has examined the prone position impact on catheter-association infection in these population.

Catheter colonization, catheter-associated infection and catheter-associated bacteremia are a major challenge for resuscitation unit.

 This study wishes to explore the impact of the central venous catheter colonization on the ARDS patient with and without prone position.
