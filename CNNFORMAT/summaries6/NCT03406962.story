(firstQuint)MGTA-456 in Patients With Inherited Metabolic Disorders Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

 This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGTA-456 after myeloablative conditioning to induce rapid and sustained hematopoietic engraftment with replacement of the specific protein product missing or defective in the patient with an IMD.

 The study aims to enhance the efficacy of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), to preserve neurodevelopment in patients with selected IMDs.

 Since MGTA-456 offers increased numbers of HSCs over standard UCB, it is expected to reduce the risks of prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and graft failure, and potentially transplant-related mortality (TRM).

 Patients with Hurler syndrome (also referred to as mucopolysaccharidosis-1H (MPS-1H)), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) (also referred to as Krabbe disease) could be eligible for this study.
