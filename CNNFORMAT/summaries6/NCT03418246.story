(secondQuint)Cervical Carious Lesions Restored With Calcium Silicate Based Cement (Biodentine) Compared With Glass-ionomer Cement.

 The study will compare two different dental materials on dental lesions near the gum line.

 .

 The study will determine if one material is more effective in gingival health, after the placement of the two different dental materials.

The oral hygiene and the gingival health of the restored teeth will be evaluated clinically at 1, 3 and 6-month intervals.
