(thirdQuint)Validation of the GenePOC Strep A, C/G Assay for Detecting Group A, C and G -hemolytic Streptococcus From Throat Swabs.

.

 The GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay will be performed using the revogene instrument.

 The revogene instrument, used in conjunction with appropriate reagents, is capable of automated cell lysis, dilution of nucleic acids from multiple sample types as well as automated amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.

 The GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay reagents kits consist of: 1.

 Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) 2.

 Disposable Transfer Tool (DTT) 3.

 Disposable microfuidic cartridges (PIE) The test is performed using the revogene cent .

 The revogene automates sample homogenization, sample dilution, cells lysis, DNA amplification, and detection of the amplified PCR products.

 User intervention is only required for discharging the patient sample into the Sample Buffer Tube (SBT), transferring the sample into the PIE, and loading/unloading the PIEs into the revogene carousel.

 A dual swab sample is collected when ICF is signed by patient.

 One of the swab is transferred into the SBT and vortexed.

 Sample is then transferred to the GenePOC Strep A, C/G PIE.

 The GenePOC Strep A, C/G PIE is then automatically processed by the revogene.

 On completion of a run, the user removes the processed PIEs from the instrument and discards them according to local biological waste management procedures.

 One revogene will be allocated per site.

 The purpose of this clinical trial is to enroll sufficient patients from up to ten (10) Clinical Centers to obtain a total of 120 positives for Streptococcus group A and 100-120 positives for Streptococcus group C or G based on the Reference Method final result.

@highlight

The primary purpose of this clinical investigation is to establish the performance of the GenePOC Strep A, C/G assay on the revogene.

 This will be achieved by comparing the test to a conventional method for detection of Group A -hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) and pyogenic Group C and G -hemolytic Streptococcus (GCS/GGS) in throat swab samples.
