(thirdQuint)Burden of Illness in Hypoparathyroidism.

 Design: In a cross-sectional trial the subjective health status and burden of illness in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism will be evaluated by using a disease specific questionnaire as well as the SF-36.

 Patients: Patients will be recruited out of the patient population of the participating five medical centers.

 Statistical Analysis: Documentation and analysis will be performed at the Department of Medicine I, Endocrine and Diabetes Unit, University of Wurzburg, Germany.

 Data will be documented after pseudonymisation in a data base.

 For further analysis data will be compared to sex- and age-matched controls.

 Burden of Illness in Hypoparathyroidism@highlight

Long-term conventional treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism does not fully restore calcium homeostasis leading to increased morbidity, emergency events and reduced subjective health status.

 To further investigate general morbidity, hypocalcemic events, subjective and daily life performance in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism a disease specific questionnaire, as well as the SF-36 are handed out.
