(thirdQuint)Functional Research of Emulsifiers in Humans.

 This is a randomized double-blind, controlled feeding experiment examining the effect of CMC on the stool microbiota composition, gene expression, and microbiota localization with respect to the epithelium.

 In addition, the investigators will assess the impact of CMC exposure in the diet on markers of metabolic syndrome including response to oral glucose tolerance testing and other plasma metabolite measurements.

 Sixteen healthy volunteers will be recruited for a 17-day in-patient study.

 All participants will receive 3 full days of freshly prepared emulsifier-free food to begin the study.

 This will be called the "washout period".

 Participants will then be randomized into an "emulsifier-free" arm and a "CMC" arm in a 1:1 ratio.

 Both arms will continue the same diet except that the "CMC" arm's brownie and sorbet will have CMC added to achieve a level of 15 gm per person per day consumption.

 Serial collection of fecal, plasma, urine and mucosal biopsy samples will be performed to investigate the extent to which CMC consumption by humans impacts the gut microbiota and its interaction with the host parameters related to inflammation and metabolism.

 Participants will have daily urine and stool collections.

 Sigmoidoscopies and glucose tolerance testing will be completed on day 4 and 17.

 Blood samples are collected on days 1-5, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 17.

 Functional Research of Emulsifiers in Humans@highlight

A randomized double-blind study of the effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on stool microbiota composition, microbiota localization, and metabolic parameters in healthy subjects.

 It includes a 17-day in-patient stay, randomization to an emulsifier-free group or a CMC group with the same diet except baked goods/sorbet with added CMC at 15g/person/day.
