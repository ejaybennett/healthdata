(thirdQuint)Phase I Study of RiMO-301 With Radiation in Advanced Tumors.

 Primary Objectives: cent The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RiMO-301 as determined by toxicity observed in patients treated with palliative radiation doses Secondary Objectives: - To determine clinical response after RiMO-301 and radiotherapy as assessed by clinical response rate using clinical evaluation, imaging and/or symptom relief - To characterize adverse events of RiMO-301 in patients with advanced cancers - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RiMO-301 with radiation The target population is patients with clinically accessible lesions for intratumoral injection.

 Up to 3 dose levels (5%, 10%, and 15% of the total baseline tumor volume, respectively) will be tested in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.

 MTD will be defined as the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose level tested.

 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events occurring from the intratumor injection of RiMO-301 to 30 days after the completion of radiation treatment: - Grade 4 or greater treatment related hematologic or dermatologic toxicity - Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhea without maximal medical intervention).

 Phase I Study of RiMO-301 With Radiation in Advanced Tumors@highlight

This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of RiMO-301 with radiation in patients with advanced tumors.

 A single escalation dose of RiMO-301 is intratumorally injected in a 3 + 3 study design to identify the recommended dose and dosing volumes.

 Condition or Disease: Patient with advanced tumor which is clinically accessible for intratumoral injection Intervention/Treatment: Drug - RiMO-301 Radiation - Radiotherapy Phase: Phase 1
