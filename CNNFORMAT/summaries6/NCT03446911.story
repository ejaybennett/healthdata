(fifthQuint)Combining SBRT and Immunotherapy in Early Stage NSCLC Patients Planned for Surgery.

 An open label randomized exploratory study of the safety and mechanisms of action of combined treatment with SBRT and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, anti-PD1) for early stage NSCLC.

 Intervention: Patients will be randomized between SBRT with or without 2 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment (starting on the first day of radiotherapy).

 The patients will undergo a lobectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection after SBRT +/- pembrolizumab treatment.

 Translational research to explore the immune mechanism of action will include biological imaging with immuno-PET (positron emission tomography).

 Expression rates and activation states of immune effector subsets will be assessed in tumor core biopsy specimens, peripheral blood and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) by means of fine needle aspirates of TDLNs.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: To assess the safety of combined SBRT and pembrolizumab treatment in early stage NSCLC and to identify the immunological mechanism of action.

 Combining SBRT and Immunotherapy in Early Stage NSCLC Patients Planned for Surgery@highlight

This study aims to evaluate the safety and mechanisms of action of the trimodality treatment (radiotherapy, immunotherapy and surgery) in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

 Half of the patients will receive stereotactic ablative radiotherapy followed by 2 cycles of immunotherapy (pembrolizumab); the other half will not receive the immunotherapy treatment.

 After treatment, both groups will continue treatment according to guidelines and will undergo surgery (lobectomy).
