(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of Muscles Energy Technique on Management of Chronic Mechanical Low Back Pain.

 The current treatment option for chronic MLBP involves; Physiotherapy, Medication, then Surgery, however, Drugs are generally regarded as a reasonable option for some episodes of acute back pain, but the evidence for use in chronic low back pain is unclear.

 although drugs can provide short-term relief in some patients with chronic low back pain, their long-term benefits remain unproven.

 Surgical interventions are indicated for Chronic MLBP patients with persistent radiculopathy resulting from common degenerative conditions, the surgery can reduce pain, prevent deformity and improve function.

Physiotherapy remains the best treatment of choice for gaining relief from CMLBP, this is because exercise therapy is effective in decreasing pain and improving function, it also helps decrease the rate of recurrence to about six months after the program.

 Muscles Energy Technique as a physiotherapy procedure was found to be effective to be effective in the management of acute and subacute Mechanical Low Back Pain, however, its effectiveness in CMLBP is yet to established in terms of preventing recurrence, reducing pain, improving trunk stability, Quality of Life, Functional Disabilities, activity limitation and Participation restriction associated with CMLBP.

 The technique is classified as an active technique in which the patient voluntarily uses his muscles from a precisely controlled position in a specific direction, against a distinctly executed counterforce by the therapist.

 MET may be used to lengthen a shortened or spastic muscle, to strengthen weakened muscles, to reduce localized edema, or to mobilize restricted joint motion of the body.

 The function of any joint in the body which can be moved by voluntary muscle action, directly or indirectly, can be influenced by MET.

 Although, the physiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MET are unclear, but may involve a variety of neurological and biomechanical mechanisms, including hypoalgesia, altered proprioception, motor programming and control, and changes in tissue fluid.

Therefore the purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of MET, its influence on the reducing level of pain perception, Stability of Spine, quality of life, functional disability, activity limitation and participation restriction of patients with the chronic MLBP, by comparing it with another well-researched physiotherapy procedure called Core Stabilization Exercise (CSE).

 Several studies have researched the effectiveness of MET alone or by comparing it with another well-known Physiotherapy procedure for the treatment of MLBP and reported promising results.

 Although the studies used similar intervention protocols as intended by this study, however the recent Cochrane review by Franke and core workers reported that the quality of researchers related to testing the effectiveness of MET is poor due methodological deficiencies, hence low-quality evidence.

 Therefore the uniqueness of this study in relation to the previous ones is that; this intends to use robust methodology especially in the area of sample size, sample selection, a risk of bias, treatment protocol, and follow-up period.

 Additionally, the study intends use recent advance outcome measuring tools in musculoskeletal physiotherapy e.

g.

 Electromyography, Sonography, Optoelectronic stereo-photogrammetry, Trunk dynamometer etc.

 The outcome will effectively help in a quantitative subject-specific analysis which is useful in the prevention, early diagnosis (e.

g.

 monitoring of the functional status of MLBP patients), intervention (e.

g.

 prognosis, therapeutic programming, workplace optimization, physical training) and for quantifying the effect of the treatment and patients outcomes.

 To achieve the aim of the study, its segmented into three phases of Objectives viz; Phase 1: 1) To establish the Sociodemographic Profile MLBP inJigawa state Northwest Nigeria.

 2)To determine the nature and extent of MLBP management.

 3) To explore the current treatment plans of MLBP by Interviewing Physiotherapist in the State.

 4) To review/appraise the literature on MET procedure currently used for the treatment of MLBP (scoping review).

 5)To design and test MET procedure that addresses Spinal instability, functional disability, QoL, activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CMLBP using Delphi Technique.

 6)Implementation of the protocol (Pilot and Main Intervention).

 7) To determine the effectiveness of the MET protocol in addressing spinal instability, functional disability and QoL at 6 and 12weeks of Intervention by assessment using outcometools.

 8) To compare the effectiveness of MET vs CSE, MET vs MET plus CSE, MET vs control group at baseline, 6weeks and 12weeks.

 9)To determine the effect of MET on activity limitations and participation restrictions at 3 and 6month post interventions.

 10) To evaluate the MET protocol and establish its success, or otherwise, any factor that limits its effectiveness can be identified.

 The result of this study will help provide a wealth of information that will add value to the existing literature in the management of chronic MLBP.

 Similarly, the study will help clinician in clinical decision making for the appropriate management protocol of chronic MLBP in which the efficacy will be tested and confirmed using standard research methodology that will improve patients' quality of life and functional disability.

 Additionally, it will serve as a resource material, reference or guide that future researchers can use and obtain useful information about manual therapy in the rehabilitation of chronic MLBP and other related musculoskeletal conditions.

 Effectiveness of Muscles Energy Technique on Management of Chronic Mechanical Low Back Pain@highlight

Low back pain is the most common health problem that affects work performance and quality of life.

 It's defined as pain, stiffness and discomfort experienced in the area lying on the posterior aspect of the body from the lower margin of the twelfth rib to the lower gluteal folds that could be referred into one or both lower limbs lasting for at least 1 day.

 LBP may be classified by duration as acute (pain less than 6 weeks), sub-acute (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) or by the underlying cause (non-mechanical or mechanical).

 Mechanical low back pain (MLBP) or Unspecified is defined as low back pain not attributable to recognizable, known specific pathology.

 It is the leading cause of disability amongst the major musculoskeletal conditions which leads to Impairments, Activity limitations and Participation restrictions.

 Therefore it becomes a psychosocial/economic burden on individuals, families, communities, industries and government.

 Existing literature shows globally 40% to 50% of people have LBP at some point in their lives and there exists a challenge in Africa on the best rehabilitation methods for low back pain which could prevent chronic pain and disability as evident in a literature.

 The aim of the study is to understand the profile of the MLBP in Jigawa state Northwest Nigeria, in order to test the effectiveness of Muscles Energy Technique intervention as an appropriate procedure that can influence spinal instability, relieve pain, decrease functional disability, improve Quality of life (QoL), Activity limitation and Participation restrictions.

 The study intends to use recent advance techniques in measuring outcomes variable of Physiotherapy research like Electromyography machine to establish an empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the study interventions in Patients with CMLBP.
