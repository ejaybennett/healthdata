(firstQuint)Optimizing the Interval Between Cycles of PRRT With 177lu-dotatate in sstr2 Positive Tumors.

 The main objective of this randomized phase II comparative study is to evaluate the Progression Free survival (PFS) and the safety as co-primary objective of two different schedule of administrations of 177lu-dotatate: intensive (every 5 weeks) vs no intensive (every 8-10 weeks) The secondary objectives are DCR, the late toxicity, OS and dosimetry.

 Patients with any tumor histotype documented as sst2-positive in pre-study period will be enrolled in the study.

 The study will include a total of 618 planned patients.

 They will be randomly assigned to receive 5 cycles of PRRT at intervals of 5 or 8-10 weeks between cycles.
