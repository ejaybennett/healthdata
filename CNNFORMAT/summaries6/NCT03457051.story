(fifthQuint)Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) Versus Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) of Medial Osteoarthritis.

 Osteoarthritis of the knee is an increasingly common problem for many Canadians aged 50 or greater.

 When conservative management fails, patients are often offered a type of knee replacement as treatment.

 The choices are a total knee replacement or a partial knee replacement, which carry distinct advantages and disadvantages.

 Typically, patients with partial knee replacement have less post operative pain, quicker recovery and enhanced function with greater knee bend.

 There is however a higher chance of revision where the pain is not relieved or the implant fails.

 The decision for which replacement to offer is now primarily surgeon driven, shaped by their experience, review of evidence and capability to perform either of these options.

 Canadian patients would benefit from a decision making model so their own values can shape and determine the decision.

 This research hopes to evaluate the merits of a patient based decision aid which explicitly details the risks and benefits of both procedures as they are best understood today.

 Further, the quality of the current evidence is only moderately strong limited by patient selection biases and there is a need for contemporary comparative study trial of the 2 procedures to help clinicians and patients make the decision.

 A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial is being proposed to evaluate the outcomes of both procedures, which will help shape a multicentre Canadian study.

 Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) Versus Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) of Medial Osteoarthritis@highlight

This study allows patients to take part of the decision making between a unicompartment knee (partial ) or a total Knee replacement .

 Using the measures of a decision aid questionnaire which explicitly details the risks and benefits of both procedures.

The study will use subjective (reported by patient) and objective data (which will be measured) to allow the determination if one option is superior to the other.

 Information gathered from this study will be used to assist future patients in selecting the surgical option that best fits their life style.

 A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial will help to evaluate the outcomes of both procedures and help shape a multicentre Canadian study.
