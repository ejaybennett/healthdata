(fifthQuint)Collection of Sputum and Labeling for Lung Cancer.

 This study will be performed at multiple study centers to collect sputum samples from three cohorts including (1) healthy Participants, (2) individuals at high risk for lung cancer and (3) individuals who have been diagnosed with lung cancer.

 Participants in the high risk cohort will undergo low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans to confirm they do not have lung cancer.

 LDCT scans will be evaluated by a radiologist at each site.

 Each subject's sputum specimen will be processed in accordance with individual experimental protocol at the laboratory of bioAffinity Technologies, Inc.

 (BA) located at the University of Texas at San Antonio 1604 main campus in San Antonio, Texas, or at the Research DX laboratory in Irvine, California.

 Once a sample is obtained and delivered to the laboratory, the Assay methodology consists of chemical dissociation of sputum to produce a single cell suspension sample that is labeled with antibodies to identify various types of cell populations in the sample.

 Thereafter, sputum samples are stained with the cancer detection compound, CyPath(R) Lung.

 This compound has a unique fluorescent spectrum that can be analyzed by a flow cytometer.

 The flow cytometric analysis confirms that the sample is from the deep lung and identifies various cell populations based on characteristics such as cell size, granularity, and antigen expression.

 Cancer samples can be distinguished from non-cancer samples by the presence of highly fluorescent cells labeled by CyPath(R).

 In this manner, CyPath(R) can identify lung cancer cells and other distinguishing cells that have been sloughed off in the lungs and coughed up in the sputum sample, including cancer cells.

 Researchers who will be blinded as to the Participant's identity will perform the experiments that compare the characteristics of samples collected by the alternate sample collection methods and labeled by CyPath(R) Lung.

 In the latter phase of the study, the analytical results of sputum sample analysis requires that the researchers be blinded to the classification of the sputum sample and methods of collection.

 Findings from the CyPath(R) Lung Assay will not be used in the diagnosis of Participants or subsequent treatment decisions.

 Collection of Sputum and Labeling for Lung Cancer@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare Assay results to diagnoses determined by currently accepted standards for lung cancer detection.

 This will be accomplished by analysis of sputum samples from three cohorts including healthy Participants, high risk Participants, and cancer patient Participants using the Assay as developed in accordance with findings of bioAffinity protocol BA-001 to confirm assay results.

 Adjustments will be made as necessary to finalize Assay design for clinical trials and commercialization.

 The secondary objective of this study is to determine optimum methods for collection of sputum samples.

 Three sputum collection methods used by high risk Participants will be compared.

 Individuals at high risk for lung cancer will be assigned to one of three sputum collection cohorts including (1) acapella(R) airway assist device under medical supervision to obtain a single sputum sample; (2) acapella(R) airway assist device to obtain a sputum sample over a three-day period, and (3) individuals who under medical supervision will collect a single sputum sample assisted by nebulization of between 0.

9% to 10% hypertonic saline.

 Samples will be compared to determine the optimal collection method for sample analysis by CyPath(R) Lung.
