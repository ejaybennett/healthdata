(thirdQuint)Maximal Exercise Capacity, Physical Activity and Respiratory Muscle Strength in Peripheral Artery Disease.

 Peripheral artery disease is characterized by reduced exercise capacity, physical activity level and intermittent claudication.

 The number of studies investigating maximal and submaximal exercise capacity and physical activity level in PAD is limited.

 There is also no study investigated pulmonary functions, respiratory muscle strength and endurance in this patient population.

 According to the sample size analysis 15 patients and 15 healthy individuals with similar demographic characteristics will be included the study.

 Patients and healthy individuals will be selected according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 The assessments will be completed in two days.

Maximal exercise capacity will be assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), functional exercise capacity using six minute stepper test, physical activity using multi-sensor activity monitor, pulmonary function using spirometry, respiratory muscle strength using mouth pressure device, peripheral muscle strength using hand held dynamometer, respiratory muscle endurance using incremental threshold loading test, depression using Beck depression inventory (Turkish version), life quality using SF-36 Health Survey (Turkish version), intermittent claudication using Walking Impairment Questionnaire (Turkish version).

 Maximal Exercise Capacity, Physical Activity and Respiratory Muscle Strength in Peripheral Artery Disease@highlight

The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the maximal and submaximal exercise capacity in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).

 The secondary aim of the study is assessment of physical activity level, respiratory function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, depression, quality of life, intermittent claudication and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD.
