(secondQuint)Coordinating Center: Natural History of Barrett's Esophagus Using Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy.

 The progression of Barrett's Esophagus will be studied over time using tethered capsule endomicroscopy imaging and will be performed at 5 different clinical centers in the US, namely: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),(MA), Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (FL), Mayo Clinic Rochester (MN), Columbia University Medical Center (NY), Kansas City VA Medical Center (MO).

 MGH will be the coordinating center of this multicenter study.
