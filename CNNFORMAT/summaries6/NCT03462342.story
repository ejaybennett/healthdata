(thirdQuint)Combination ATR and PARP Inhibitor (CAPRI) Trial With AZD6738 and Olaparib in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

 Women 18 years or older, who have recurrent ovarian cancer will be enrolled in this study.

 After consenting to participate in this trial, they will undergo screening process which will involve medical exam and blood work.

 If found eligible to participate in the trial, they will be given olaparib to be taken on all 28 days of the cycle and investigational AZD 6738 from days 1-7.

 For the first cycle, the subject will need to come in every week for lab tests and physical exam - this will help the treating physician determine an adverse event as soon as it happens.

 After that, patients are expected to come in every month at the end of each cycle (each cycle is 28 days).

 Patients will undergo scans for tumor assessments every 2 cycles and if stable disease or response to therapy is documented after cycle 4, imaging will continue every 3 cycles thereafter.

Investigational agent, AZD6738 will be given in combination with Olaparib to women with recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).

 This study will determine if using Olaparib in combination with AZD6738 is safe and tolerable and also determine the objective response rate and progression free survival of combination of AZD 6738 and Olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in distinct Pt-sensitive and Pt-resistant cohorts.
