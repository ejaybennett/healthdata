(thirdQuint)Modulation of GABA-A Receptors in Parkinson Disease-Flumazenil Arm.

 This biomechanistic GABA-A receptor target engagement study includes clinical and motor assessments before and at various time points up to approximately 90 minutes after the i.

v.

 administration of 1 mg flumazenil and placebo in Parkinson disease subjects.

 Thirty Parkinson disease subjects with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr) stages 2-4 will be recruited.

 Baseline [11C]FMZ and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) [11C]DTBZ brain PET imaging will be performed prior to drug administration to assess for GABA-A receptor availability and the integrity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals, respectively.
