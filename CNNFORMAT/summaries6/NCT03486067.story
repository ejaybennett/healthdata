(firstQuint)Study of CC-93269, a BCMA x CD3 T Cell Engaging Antibody, in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-93269, administered intravenously (IV), to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and non-tolerated dose (NTD) of both the first dose and subsequent doses of CC-93269.

 The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-93269 administered at or below the MTD in selected expansion cohorts in order to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

 One or more dosing regimens may be selected for cohort expansion.

 All treatments will be administered in 28-day cycles for up to 2 years until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject/Investigator decision to withdraw.
