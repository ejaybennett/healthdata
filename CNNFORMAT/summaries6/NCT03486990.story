(thirdQuint)Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TIMP-GLIA in Subjects With Celiac Disease.

 This study is a 2-part, multicenter study.

 In Part A, eligible subjects will be enrolled into escalating dose cohorts (n = 2/cohort for 2 dose levels followed by n = 3/cohort for 5 dose levels).

 TIMP-GLIA will be administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1.

 A staggered dosing strategy will be used in Part A.

 Subjects will undergo medical observation in the clinic for at least 48 hours after dosing and participate in outpatient follow-up visits.

 Adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory data (serum chemistry, coagulation, hematology and urinalysis, cytokines) will be assessed by a Safety Committee before the next cohort will be dosed at a higher dose level.

 After completion of Part A and confirmation by the Safety Committee to proceed, eligible subjects (n=3) will receive two IV infusions of TIMP-GLIA, 7 days apart, on Day 1 and on Day 8.

 Each subject in Part B will be observed in clinic for 48 hours after each dose and undergo similar testing and follow-up visits as in Part A.

 The safety and pharmacokinetic profile of TIMP-GLIA will be characterized.

 Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TIMP-GLIA in Subjects With Celiac Disease@highlight

This study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of an investigational drug called TIMP-GLIA when either one or two intravenous doses are given to subjects with celiac disease.

 The way the body reacts to TIMP-GLIA is being checked by laboratory tests of the blood and urine, and study participant health will also be monitored by vital signs such as blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical examination.
