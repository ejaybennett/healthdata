(thirdQuint)A Personalized Self-Management Program for Older Adults With Chronic Pain and Negative Emotions.

 This study examines the effects of PATH-Pain on emotion regulation to improve self-management of pain and pain-related disability in older adults with chronic pain, negative emotions, and cognitive impairment.

 We propose that emotion regulation is the mechanism of change through which PATH-Pain improves pain and pain-related disability (outcomes).

 This pilot study will provide initial evidence of the: a) feasibility and acceptability of PATH-Pain; b) effects of PATH-Pain on emotion regulation (mechanism of change) and outcomes (pain and pain-related disability); and c) mediating effect of emotion regulation (mechanism of change) on outcomes (pain and pain-related disability).

 We will randomize 120 older adults (60 years or older) with chronic non-cancer related pain and negative emotions to PATH-Pain vs.

 Usual Care with Education (UCE).

 PATH-Pain will be administered by licensed mental health clinicians.

 Research assessments will be conducted at the Wright Center at study entry (baseline), and at 6, 12 (end of treatment), and 24 weeks.

 A Personalized Self-Management Program for Older Adults With Chronic Pain and Negative Emotions@highlight

This study examines the effects of PATH-Pain on emotion regulation to improve self-management of pain and pain-related disability in older adults with chronic pain, negative emotions, and cognitive impairment.

 Half the participants will receive the intervention, and half the participants will receive usual care with education.

 Intervention subjects are hypothesized to have significantly less pain-related disability versus usual care subjects after 24 weeks.
