(firstQuint)Longitudinal Changes of Brain Functional Connectivity in Migraine.

 Migraine is associated with functional alterations in specific brain networks.

 The investigators aimed to identify network abnormalities which remain unchanged throughout the longitudinal course of migraine.

 The investigators also aimed to identify networks which change in association with changes in migraine frequency and associated psychiatric conditions.

 The investigators expect these can serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis of migraine brain and monitoring of disease severity.

The purpose of this study is to identify a core fMRI feature that determines migrainous brain and plastic fMRI features that changes with longitudinal courses of migraine.
