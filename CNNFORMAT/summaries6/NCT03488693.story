(thirdQuint)Regional Radiotherapy in Biomarker Low Risk Node Positive Breast Cancer.

 Women with node positive breast cancer normally will receive endocrine therapy and some may receive chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from coming back.

 Many women will also receive radiotherapy to the whole breast/chest area and the surrounding lymph glands (called regional radiotherapy).

 No one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need to receive regional radiotherapy.

 Some women may be getting regional radiotherapy who do not need it.

 These women may be exposed to the side effects of their treatment without benefit.

 Regional Radiotherapy in Biomarker Low Risk Node Positive Breast Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on low risk breast cancer receiving usual care that includes regional radiation therapy, with receiving no regional radiation therapy.

 Researchers want to see if not giving this type of radiation treatment works as well at preventing breast cancer from coming back.
