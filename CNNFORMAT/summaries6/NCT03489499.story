(firstQuint)Genetic Variants and Postoperative Pain.

 Background Severe acute pain as well as long-lasting pain after surgery and pain-related interference of daily activities are frequent.

 Some risk factors for severe pain after surgery in adults have been described, e.

g.

 younger age and pre-existing chronic pain.

 The question arises whether a specific genetic background is related to an unfavorable pain outcome.

 Objective The aim of this study is to investigate clinical and genetic variables and their possible association to severe acute postoperative pain, higher analgesic consumption and the development of chronic postsurgical pain.

 Methods Prospective observational study investigating clinical, patient related, surgery related and anesthesia related variables as well as genetic variants and their possible association to patients' pain related outcome after surgery.
