(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of BCMA-CART for Treating Multiple Myeloma.

 BCMA(B-Cell maturation antigen) is a tumor specific antigen of multiple myeloma (MM).

 Using a genetic engineering strategy to assemble an anti-BCMA CAR(chimeric antigen receptor) in autologous T cells will help these CART cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing MM tumor cells.

 This trial aims to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of autologous BCMA-CART with a human ScFv(single-chain variable fragment) in treating relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.
