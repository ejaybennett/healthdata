(secondQuint)PuraPly AM Plus the Standard of Care to Standard of Care Alone for the Management of Stage II-IV Pressure Ulcers.

.

 This study seeks to demonstrate how PuraPly(R) AM performs against standard of care in Stage II-IV Pressure Ulcers through a prospective randomized controlled study design.

 Subjects may be enrolled for up to 24 weeks; if healing occurs prior to week 24, a follow up healing confirmation visit shall occur two weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete wound closure and participation may continue up to 24 weeks.

 Subjects that are randomized to the SOC group have the opportunity to cross over and receive PuraPly AM at week 12 if their index ulcer has not healed; they will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks for up to 24 weeks.
