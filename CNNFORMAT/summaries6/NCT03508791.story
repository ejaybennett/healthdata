(secondQuint)Effect of Patient Position on Arterial, End-tidal and Transcutaneous Carbon Dioxide.

 Investigators evaluate the effect of patient position (Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg) on arterial, end-tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

 Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure is assessed intermittently before, during, and after pneumoperitoneum.

 End-tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure are continuously monitored.
