(firstQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of shRNA-modified CD34+ Cells in HIV-infected Patients.

.

 CD34+ cells will be isolated from mobilized PBMC of HIV patients.

 The cells will be lentivirally transduced with multiplexed shRNAs in the same vector that target CCR5 and HIV genome.

 Such modified cells will be infused back to the patients who have received bulsufan preconditioning before infusion.

 The patients will then be evaluated for efficacy and safety.

 An Efficacy and Safety Study of shRNA-modified CD34+ Cells in HIV-infected Patients.

@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous CD34+ cells that stably express multiplexed shRNA to treat HIV infection.
