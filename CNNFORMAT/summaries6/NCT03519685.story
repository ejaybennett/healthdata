(thirdQuint)UCSF College Health Study on Contraceptive Training and Education at Community Colleges.

 In the US, young women aged 18-25 years experience high rates of unintended pregnancy and have limited knowledge of contraception or their pregnancy risks.

 They have little familiarity with the full range of contraceptives, particularly long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) including the IUD and implant.

 This campus-level, multiple component intervention provides evidence-based contraceptive training and education to clinic staff and students in this age group attending community colleges in California.

The purpose of this study is to measure whether a training and education intervention for clinic staff and young women aged 18-25 on contraceptive methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the implant, will result in greater contraceptive knowledge and access among students in community colleges.
