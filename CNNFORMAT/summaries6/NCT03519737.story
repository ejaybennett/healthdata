This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcranial ultrasound (TUS) using the Sonolysis Headframe as an adjunctive therapy to intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy in subjects with acute ischemic stroke that initially present at non-endovascular (EVT) treating hospitals that have established transport services in place to transfer subjects to hospitals capable of performing EVT.
