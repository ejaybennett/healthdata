(fifthQuint)Emotion Prosthetics for Augmentation of Mindfulness.

 For the past decade, prospective studies have shown that positive emotions have been correlated with physical health and longevity.

 Those who experience more positive emotions have fewer colds, reduced inflammation, and can recover from stress more effectively.

 According to the Fredrickson's broaden and build theory, positive emotion such as joy, interest, love and contentment can broaden an individual's thought-action repertoire and build on that individual's personal resources, which should lead to an upward spiral of positive emotion that can counter downward spirals of negativity and stress.

 Induction of positive emotion has been shown to broaden scope of attention using a global-local visual processing task, increase breadth of thought-action repertoire using a thought listing task, and result in faster recovery from cardiovascular sequelae of negative emotions.

 Perceived positive social connections increase positive emotions, an effect moderated in part by baseline vagal tone.

 Mindfulness interventions also have physical and mental health benefits.

 Mindfulness can be defined as moment-to-moment awareness in one's present experience and adopting an attitude of openness or acceptance toward one's experience.

 Standard protocol for Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) consists of 8 weekly 2.

5-hour group sessions and has been applied to many populations including those with depression and anxiety.

 There are also brief experimental mindful attention inductions that have been developed although these approaches appear to have small and transient effects.

 Positive predictors of mindfulness include individuals with higher self-esteem, autonomy and competence.

 Negative predictors of mindfulness include individuals with higher levels of neuroticism trait, anxiety, depression, and negative affectivity.

 However, studies have also shown that mindfulness is less effective when individuals behave compulsively or automatically, without awareness or attention to one's behavior.

 Prior research has shown that mindfulness do affect markers of calmness and stress, including heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (HRV), and EEG.

 Stress is characterized by hyper-reactivity in the sympathetic nervous system which is associated with increased arousal and vigilance, and compromised reactivity of the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps to regulate emotion and stress responses.

 HRV is widely used as a biomarker for the coordinated activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous symptom.

 A calmer, less stressful state is typically marked by increased HRV, likely attributed to respiration based parasympathetic stimulation.

 GSR is also a reliable index for sweat gland activity and changes in activation level of the sympathetic nervous system, and GSR usually increases with higher levels of stress.

 EEG changes, such as elevated prefrontal gamma and theta, have also been associated with state of relaxed alertness.

 Large scientific literature supports the role of vibration in regulating physiology.

 Based on literature, slow whole-body vibration, in the 0.

01 to 0.

3 Hz range, is associated with increased ratings of pleasantness and increased parasympathetic tone.

 Stimulation at about 100 Hz has been shown to activate the posterior insula which is associated with increased attention to interoception, as promoted in many meditative traditions.

 Transcutaneous targets for the vibration frequencies have also been identified, including stellate ganglion and vagus nerve.

 Currently, in Dr.

 Siegle's lab, TVS has been shown to reduce subjective stress, increase positive affect, along with increases in behavioral performance.

 The investigators hypothesize that TVS added to mindfulness will increase positive emotions and heighten state of awareness, leading to broadening of perspectives in individuals.

 Emotion Prosthetics for Augmentation of Mindfulness@highlight

Prior research in Dr.

 Siegle's lab has shown a novel intervention Tuned Vibroacoustic Stimulation (TVS), can have a calming and positive effect.

 Here, the investigators will continue to evaluate the extent to which TVS, capitalizing on a preserved neurocircuitry for sympathetic and parasympathetic system activity, can be used to modify arousal responses, increase positive affective emotions, overriding otherwise prepotent negative stress reactions.

 Mindfulness is a popular intervention for stress.

 Yet it does not work for everyone.

 The investigators suggest this is because mindfulness relies on interoception which is not strong (or not sufficiently practiced) in everyone.

 Here the investigators provide an extroceptive cue (TVS) which increases activity in the same networks tapped by mindfulness.

 The investigators will show that this cue, which is physiologically reactive, decreases stress and increases physiological indicators of emotion regulation, and further show that it will do this during mindfulness yielding increased effects of mindfulness, to the extent that some individuals will experience heightened states of awareness, often described by advanced practitioners with thousands of hours of meditation.

 100 individuals will be assessed physiologically during active intervention.

 Mechanisms of attentional focus on tasks will be assessed.

 Success will suggest that a dynamic intervention is possible without effort, medication or psychotherapy.
