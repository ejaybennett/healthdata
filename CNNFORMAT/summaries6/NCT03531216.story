(secondQuint)Topical Rosemary Oil Application in Systemic Sclerosis.

 In a crossover design, patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (12 subjects) receive applications of olive oil and of 10% Rosmarinus officinalis L.

 (rosemary) essential oil to both hands with a wash-out period of 3 hours.

 Effects on vasodilatation are measured with infrared thermography.

 Patients' sense of warmth is assessed by the "Herdecke warmth perception questionnaire".

 Measurements take place at baseline and 45 minutes following the interventions (pre-post-comparison).

 To determine within and between-differences, 2-sample t-tests will be used and effect sizes will be calculated (Standardized Effect Size).
