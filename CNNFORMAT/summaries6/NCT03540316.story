(thirdQuint)Treatment Outcome of Short Implant Assisted Mandibular Overdenture.

 The conventional solution to complete edentulism is the use of complete removable dentures.

 One negative effect of edentulism is resorption of the edentulous ridge over time.

 Construction of a successful mandibular complete denture for patients with advanced mandibular ridge resorption is often difficult and on some occasions virtually impossible.

 It has been proved that when implants are placed, bone gets stimulated resulting in minimal bone loss.

 But anatomic limitations to implant placement have been observed in atrophic ridges, so short implants introduced as a recent alternative to aggressive surgical procedures proposed to compensate for tissue deficiency.

 Also, Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has proven success in improving implant stability which is very crucial in short implants.

 Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the treatment outcome of mandibular overdenture assisted by two short implants versus that assisted by four short implants in combination with LLLT.

 Treatment Outcome of Short Implant Assisted Mandibular Overdenture@highlight

This study evaluates the use of short dental implants to support mandibular overdenture together with the use of laser therapy for treatment of patients with atrophic ridges.

 All participants will receive laser therapy; half of participants will receive two short implants and the other half will receive four short implants.
