(thirdQuint)Magnesium Sulfate; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Laparoscopic Surgery.

 Magnesium is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that is known to be effective in reducing opioid consumption and controlling postoperative pain.

 This opioid reducing effect can be associated with reduction of the incidence of PONV.

 However, the effect of magnesium on preventing PONV have not been investigated before.

 Thus, the investigators hypothesized that intraoperative infusion of magnesium will be effective in preventing PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly accompanied in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia.

 The patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery have multiple risk factors for developing PONV such as female gender, nonsmoker, postoperative opioids, and laparoscopic surgery.

 Thus, it is important to prevent PONV in these patients.
