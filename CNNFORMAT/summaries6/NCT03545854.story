(fifthQuint)Dispersion of Local Anesthetic on the Erector Spinae Plane Block in Cadavers.

 The study's methodology will include performing ultrasound guided erector spinae block in cadavers included in the study according to eligibility criteria.

 After signing of written consent form, the participants will be randomized on the height of the block (vertebral level - T3, T12 and L4) and the volume to be injected (10, 20 and 30ml).

 The block will be performed by experienced physicians on the technique by ultrasound guidance and fixed pressure measured with an in-line pressure monitor (15 psi) with the cadaver in the lateral position.

 The cadavers will be submitted to autopsy by standard thoracoabdominal midline incision, with the viscera removed for analysis.

 The cadavers will have their paraspinal muscles removed (quadratus lumborum and psoas major), the medial parietal pleura opened and the number of levels with colored solution registered, noting the spread to ventral rami of spinal nerves and to the paravertebral space.

 Dispersion of Local Anesthetic on the Erector Spinae Plane Block in Cadavers@highlight

This study aims to better understand the dispersion of local anesthetic on the Erector Spinae Block, a new technique developed for analgesia.

 It consists on injection of local anesthetic around the posterior muscles of the Spine.

 In this study, the investigators will make the injection with coloring solution on cadavers and by dissection will note the dispersion of the solution according to injectate volume.

 The investigators hypothesize more volume allows bigger spread and will allow new indications of this technique in perioperative analgesia and treatment of chronic Pain
