(secondQuint)First-in-human Study of 10-1074-LS Alone and in Combination With 3BNC117-LS.

 The proposed study is a Phase 1, dose escalation cohort study of 10-1074-LS alone or in combination with 3BNC117-LS, administered intravenously and subcutaneously in HIV uninfected and HIV-1 infected individuals.

 Study participants will be administered a single intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS at escalating doses of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, single infusions of the combination of 10-1074-LS and 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg, or subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS alone or in combinations with 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 1 mL (approximately 150 mg) or 2 mL (approximately 300 mg).

 Groups administered subcutaneous injections of the product(s) will be randomized, doubleblinded, and placebo-controlled to assess potential differences in safety and tolerability of the antibody formulation versus the formulation buffer alone.

 Groups administered intravenous infusions will be enrolled in an open-label manner.

 Study participants will be followed for 48 weeks after mAb administration.

 The proposed study has two parts, Part A that will evaluate 10-1074-LS alone, and Part B will evaluate the combination of 10-1074-LS and 3BNC117-LS.

 A total of 60 to 62 participants will enroll in the following study groups: PART A Group 1A (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 1 mL (approximately 150 mg) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.

 Group 1B (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 2 mL (approximately 300 mg) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.

 Group 2A (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 3 mg/kg.

 Group 2B (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 10 mg/kg.

 Group 2C (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 30 mg/kg.

 Group 3B (n=3) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 10 mg/kg.

 Group 3C (n=3) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 30 mg/kg.

 PART B Part B will begin after the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) evaluates available safety data from Part A, as detailed below.

 The SMC will also review available safety data with 3BNC117-LS administered intravenously collected under protocol YCO-0946 prior to enrollment in Part B of this study.

 The SMC will also review subcutaneous dosing at approximately 150 mg (1 mL) and 300 mg (2 mL), collected under IND 131873 when available and prior to enrollment in Part B of this study.

 Group 4A (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 2 mL (approximately 150 mg of each mAb) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS admixed with 3BNC117-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.

 Group 4B (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered two 2 mL (approximately 300 mg of each mAb) subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS admixed with 3BNC117-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.

 Group 5 (n=5) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS and one intravenous infusion of 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg.

 Group 6A (n=5) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS and one intravenous infusion of 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg.

 Group 6B (n=3-5) - HIV-infected individuals (off ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS and one intravenous infusion 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg.

 Following mAb or placebo administration, study participants will return for safety assessments on days 1 and 3, and weeks 1, 2 and 4 following dosing, then bi-monthly or monthly until the end of study follow up.

 All participants will be followed for 48 weeks after mAb or placebo administration.

 Serum samples for PK measurements will be collected before and at the end each mAb or placebo administration and at multiple subsequent time points during study follow up.

 Samples will also be collected for measurement of HIV-1 plasma RNA levels before 10-1074-LS and 3BNC117-LS infusions (screen, pre-infusion and day 0) and at follow up visits in Groups 3B, 3C, 6A and 6B.
