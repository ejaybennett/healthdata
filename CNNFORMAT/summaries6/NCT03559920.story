(fifthQuint)The Optimal Dose of Sevoflurane Via Anaconda in Post-operative Patient Underwent Head & Neck Surgery.

 When patients, who need mechanical ventilation for several days after head & neck surgery, enters the ICU, investigators induce moderate sedation (RASS -2~-3).

 End-tidal sevoflurane (etSEVO) concentration is adjusted to 0.

5Vol% within 30 minutes.

 Sedation level is evaluated every 5 minutes.

 After 30 minutes, investigators check that the sedation goal is achieved.

 Following the up & down method, if the moderate sedation (RASS -2~-3) or the deep sedation (RASS -4~-5) is achieved at the etSEVO concentration of 0.

5vol% after 30 minutes of sedation, the next patient's target etSEVO concentration is reduced to 0.

4vol%.

 On the contrary to this, if only light sedation (RASS above -1) is achieved, the next patient's target etSEVO is increased to 0.

6vol%.

 This process is repeated to find the appropriate etSEVO concentration at the beginning of sedation, which induces sedation of RASS -2~-3.

 The Optimal Dose of Sevoflurane Via Anaconda in Post-operative Patient Underwent Head & Neck Surgery@highlight

Sedation in the ICUs is very common.

 There is no ideal sedative yet, so research has been conducted to replace propofol and midazolam, which are the most commonly used sedatives in ICUs, by inhalation anesthetics.

 investigators will sedate the patients who undergo head & neck surgery for several days using sevoflurane, a kind of inhalation agent, via anesthetic conserving device.

 The objective of this study is to confirm the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration for inducing moderate sedation (RASS -2~-3).
