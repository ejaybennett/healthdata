(firstQuint)The Effect of PACAP27 on the Extra- and Intracerebral Arteries Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) on Healthy Volunteers.

 PACAP neuropeptide, which belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)/glucagon/secretin family.

 PACAP exists in two forms: Studying Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide 38 (PACAP38), which consists of 38 amino acids and PACAP27 which contains 27 amino acids at its N-terminus.

 PACAP38 is implicated in migraine pathophysiology however PACAP27 is not studied well.

 Therefore, the investigators will study PACAP27's effect on extra- and intracerebral arteries assessed by MRA on healthy volunteers.
