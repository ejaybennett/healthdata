(fifthQuint)Irritation and Anal Bleeding in Patients Affected by Hemorrhoids.

.

 Haemorrhoidal disease is an increasingly frequent benign condition, able to negatively affect the quality of working and relationship life in affected individuals.

The primary objective of the study is the comparative assessment of the time necessary for the disappearance of bleeding comparatively in the three different therapies (controls, ProtFlav and ProtCent) to identify, if any, the most effective treatment, in terms of time reduction for the disappearance of bleeding in subjects affected by haemorrhoidal disease.

 Secondary objectives are the evaluation of the longitudinal trend in time of anal irritation measured with the VAS scale and the study of the longitudinal performance of BMI (Body Mass Index).

 The patients enrolled in the protocol will be randomized into 3 groups: the control group in which the patients will be subjected to a diet rich in water and vegetable fibers, hygienic care and anal dilator according to the traditional standardized scheme.

 The two experimental groups will be subjected to the same standard therapeutic scheme (diet rich in water and vegetable fibers, hygienic and anal dilator) of the controls, in addition to which will be added to oral supplements (group "ProtFlav") and local application as an anal cream (group "ProtCent").

 Of the patients in the interventional groups, half will take flavonoid-based supplements (ProtFlav) and the other half will take supplements and anal cream based on Centella asiatica (ProtCent), as better specified below.

 All patients will be followed for a period of 8 weeks or otherwise until recovery (disappearance of irritation and stop bleeding).

 Patients enrolled will be randomized into 3 groups: 1.

 the control group in which the patients will be subjected to the standard therapeutic care (diet rich in water and vegetable fibers, hygienic and anal dilator), 2.

 interventional group "ProtFlav": in which oral supplements (flavonoid-based supplements - ProtFlav) will be added to standard of care 3.

 interventional group "ProtCent": in which an anal application of a Centella based cream (Centella asiatica - ProtCent) will be added to standard of care
