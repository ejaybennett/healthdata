(thirdQuint)Spinal Manipulative Therapy, Heart Rate Variability and Conditioned Pain Modulation.

 Previously, Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) was thought to mechanically affect the restoration of muscular and joint function, by normalising muscle tension and joint mobility.

 However, recent research has suggested that SMT may be influencing the incoming/ascending pain signals and/or the excitability of the central pain regulating mechanisms.

 People with chronic neck/shoulder pain have been found to have a disturbance of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).

 Little is known about the changes in the ANS and its relation to changes in pain in a series of treatments conducted in a clinical setting.

 This multicentre randomized controlled clinical trial will be carried out in multimodal primary care clinics where both physiotherapists and chiropractors are consulted for musculoskeletal issues are selected to minimize selection bias from the patient's pre-desired treatment modality.

 The subjects will be recruited among patients seeking care for persistent or recurrent Neck pain (NP), either self-selected or through referrals from general practitioners in the local areal.

 The aim is to study the effect of SMT and stretching exercises compared to stretching exercises alone, two well-known interventions for NP, during a two-week treatment regimen.

 The primary outcome is the activity of the autonomic nervous system (Heart Rate Variability (HRV), but also Pressure point threshold and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) will be measured.

 HRV and pressure paint threshold will be measured at baseline, prior to the third treatment and after the fourth treatment.

 CPM will be measured at baseline to evaluate its predictive ability to treatment response.

 The subjective pain experience will be investigated by using two different instruments accessing pain intensity and the affective quality of pain, asked at the assessments during the two weeks of treatment and 2 months after the period of intervention ends.

 Highly structured data collection procedures should provide reliable data to answer these questions.

 The study utilizes normal clinical procedures, which should aid the transferability of the results.

 Spinal Manipulative Therapy, Heart Rate Variability and Conditioned Pain Modulation@highlight

This randomized, single-blinded study will investigate the effects of Spinal Manipulative Therapy on Heart Rate Variability and Pain Sensitivity in a population of patients with recurrent and persistent neck pain.

 Alongside, the study will also develop a clinical test for Conditioned Pain Modulation and investigate its predictive properties.
