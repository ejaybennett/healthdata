(fifthQuint)A Randomized Double Blind Protocol Comparing Amphotericin B With Flucytosine to Amphotericin B Alone Followed by a Comparison of Fluconazole and Itraconazole in the Treatment of Acute Cryptococcal Meningitis.

 At least 10 percent of patients with a low CD4 count and HIV infection will develop meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans.

 More effective treatments than the standard therapy need to be explored.

 Patients are selected by a randomization process to take amphotericin B intravenously (in the vein), for 14 days, and either placebo (ineffective substance) or flucytosine for 14 days.

 Then patients are again selected by a randomization process to take either (1) fluconazole for a total of 8 weeks plus itraconazole placebo; or (2) itraconazole for a total of 8 weeks plus fluconazole placebo.

 A Randomized Double Blind Protocol Comparing Amphotericin B With Flucytosine to Amphotericin B Alone Followed by a Comparison of Fluconazole and Itraconazole in the Treatment of Acute Cryptococcal Meningitis@highlight

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of amphotericin B plus flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine) compared to amphotericin B alone for a first episode of acute cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of fluconazole versus itraconazole.

 At least 10 percent of patients with a low CD4 count and HIV infection will develop meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans.

 More effective treatments than the standard therapy need to be explored.
