(fifthQuint)Comparison of Liposomal Doxorubicin Used Alone or in Combination With Bleomycin Plus Vincristine in the Treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma in Patients With AIDS.

 Liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents increase drug accumulation in tumors, which permits disease palliation at relatively low doses and thus decreases some of the dose-limiting toxicity.

 Multi-agent therapy is considered to be more effective than single-agent therapy; therefore, DOX-SL will be combined with bleomycin and vincristine.

 Patients are randomized to receive intravenous DOX-SL alone or in combination with vincristine/bleomycin every 2 weeks.

 Filgrastim ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF ) may be given as needed for neutropenia.

 AS PER AMENDMENT 11/7/96: Based on interim review data, it is recommended that subjects receiving DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin have vincristine/bleomycin discontinued and receive DOX-SL alone unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, they are benefitting from the DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin regimen.

 Comparison of Liposomal Doxorubicin Used Alone or in Combination With Bleomycin Plus Vincristine in the Treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma in Patients With AIDS@highlight

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ( DOX-SL ) alone or in combination with bleomycin and vincristine in the long-term treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

 To determine whether the 3-drug combination enhances progression-free survival and quality of life.

 Liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents increase drug accumulation in tumors, which permits disease palliation at relatively low doses and thus decreases some of the dose-limiting toxicity.

 Multi-agent therapy is considered to be more effective than single-agent therapy; therefore, DOX-SL will be combined with bleomycin and vincristine.
