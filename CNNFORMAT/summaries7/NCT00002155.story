(secondQuint)A Six-Month Safety and Antiviral Study in HIV-1 Seropositive, AZT-Experienced Patients With CD4 Counts Less Than or Equal to 50 Cells/mm3 to Evaluate MK-639 Alone Versus Zidovudine (AZT) and 3TC Versus the Combination of MK-639 With AZT/3TC.

 AZT-experienced patients are randomized to receive MK-639/AZT/3TC or MK-639 alone or AZT/3TC.

 Additionally, patients who have received < 6 months of AZT or who are intolerant but received prior 3TC or who require concomitant rifampin therapy may receive open-label MK-639.

To compare effects on CD4 counts and serum viral RNA among HIV-seropositive, zidovudine (AZT)-experienced patients in three treatment arms: indinavir sulfate ( MK-639; Crixivan ) plus AZT plus lamivudine ( 3TC ) versus MK-639 alone versus AZT/3TC.
