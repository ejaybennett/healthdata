(fifthQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Who Have Not Responded to Anthracycline-Containing Combination Chemotherapy.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy of high-dose cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin in patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed primary combination chemotherapy but still respond to conventional-dose DHAP (dexamethasone/cytarabine/cisplatin) and are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation.

 II.

 Determine the toxicity of the intensification chemotherapy regimen in this group of patients.

 OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study.

 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.

 CVP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 CR is seen in the first 6 patients, an estimated maximum of 20 patients will be enrolled.

 If 3 or more of the first 10 patients (or 25% of the study population thereafter) die within the first 35 days of treatment from causes unrelated to tumor progression, the study will be terminated.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin in treating patients with intermediate or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed following or are resistant to anthracycline-containing primary combination chemotherapy.
