(thirdQuint)Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Intermediate- or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the treatment-related neurologic and hematologic toxicities of patients aged 65 years and over with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma randomized to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) vs.

 MCOP (mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone).

 II.

 Compare the survival rate in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Randomized study.

 The following acronyms are used: CHOP CTX/DOX/VCR/PRDL CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 MCOP DHAD/CTX/VCR/PRDL PRDL Prednisolone, NSC-9900 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 Arm I: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.

 CHOP.

 Arm II: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy.

 MCOP.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years.

 Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Intermediate- or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone, with either mitoxantrone or doxorubicin in treating patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
