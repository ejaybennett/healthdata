(fifthQuint)HER-2/Neu Vaccine Plus GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Breast, Ovarian, or Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the safety of serial intradermal vaccinations of HER-2/neu derived peptides with sargramostim (GM-CSF) as an adjuvant in patients with stage III or IV HER-2/neu expressing breast, ovarian, or nonsmall cell lung cancer.

 II.

 Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein.

 III.

 Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein.

 IV.

 Determine whether cytotoxic T cells specific for the HER-2/neu protein can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by immunization with peptides derived from the HER-2/neu protein.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive one of three HER-2/neu peptide vaccine formulations that also contain sargramostim (GM-CSF) as the vaccine adjuvant.

 Each vaccine is studied in 20 patients.

 A maximum of 3 patients receive a vaccine each month for 6 months to monitor the potential toxicity associated with sequential immunizations.

 Patients receive a follow-up evaluation 1 month after the last vaccination.

 Those patients who have an immune response related to the vaccine will continue to have immunologic evaluations performed every 2 months while immune responses can still be detected.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued.

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from the HER2/neu antigen may make the body build an immune response and kill tumor cells.

 Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2/neu vaccine plus GM-CSF in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV breast cancer, stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer, or stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
