(thirdQuint)Bryostatin 1 and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and side effects of bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

 - Determine the maximum tolerated dose for interleukin-2 with bryostatin 1 in these patients.

 - Determine whether bryostatin 1 and interleukin-2 increase the expression of recognition and costimulatory molecules on human monocytes and their ability to act as antigen presenting cells.

 - Assess any anti-tumor response in these patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-2.

 Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8, and interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 1-5 and days 8-12.

 Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study in less than 2 years.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

 Combining chemotherapy and interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-2 when given together with bryostatin 1 in treating patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.
