(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of HeFi-1 to Treat Cancers With CD30 Protein.

 BACKGROUND: The scientific basis for this study is the observation that antibodies directed at the ligand-binding site of CD30 induce apoptosis in vitro and cure animals bearing CD30-positive tumors.

 HeFi-1, a murine monoclonal antibody developed at the NCI, specifically binds human CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis receptor superfamily, at the ligand-binding site.

 CD30 is expressed on activated T-cells, Reed-Sternberg cells, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and some AIDS-related lymphoma cells.

 Tumor cells from patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma are sensitive to the effects of HeFi-1 but Hodgkin's disease cell lines show variable responsiveness due to the presence of mutations in I B kinase which result in constitutive activation of NF- B.

 OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of HeFi-1 in patients with CD30-positive malignancy.

 This study will explore the pharmacokinetics, dose required to saturate CD30 binding sites in tumor aspirates, and the frequency and time course of onset of development of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA).

 These studies will allow us to monitor in a preliminary fashion the clinical tumor response, measured by reduction in tumor lesions and by following the tumor marker serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor.

 ELIGIBILITY: Patients with measurable or evaluable CD30-positive lymphoma who have become refractory to standard therapy, including Hodgkin's disease, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma are eligible for treatment.

 DESIGN: This is a phase I dose-escalation trial in which cohorts of three patients will be treated with HeFi-1 ranging from 0.

5 to 5 mg/kg/dose (total dose of 2 to 20 mg/kg per treatment course).

 Four doses will be given on an every three days schedule over a 10-day period for each cycle.

 Two cycles of therapy will be administered provided the patient has had a partial or complete response and has not developed dose-limiting toxicity or HAMA.

 Phase I Study of HeFi-1 to Treat Cancers With CD30 Protein@highlight

Background: - Some cancers, such as Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and others, have a protein on the surface of the cancer cell called CD30.

 - HeFi-1 is an antibody that binds to the CD30 protein and sends signals to the cancer cells that can cause them to die.

 Objectives: - To determine the highest dose of HeFi-1 that can safely be given to patients with tumors that have the CD30 protein.

 - To determine the response of the tumor to treatment with HeFi-1.

 Eligibility: - Patients 18 years of age and older with Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and adult T cell leukemia or lymphoma who have signs of tumor growth or recurrence following standard treatment - Patients' tumor cells must have the CD30 protein.

 Design: - Groups of three patients are treated with increasingly higher doses of HeFi-1 (ranging from 0.

5 to 5 mg/kg) to determine the highest safe dose.

 - HeFi-1 is infused through a vein on 4 days, followed by 2 days of rest over a 10-day period.

 Patients may receive up to 2 treatment courses if they show some response and do not have severe side effects.

 - Blood samples are collected several times during the study to determine safety.

 A lymph node biopsy is done at the beginning of the study to test the effect of HeFi-1 on cancer cells in the test tube, and a bone marrow biopsy may be done at the end of treatment if the bone marrow was positive for tumor cells at the beginning of treatment.
