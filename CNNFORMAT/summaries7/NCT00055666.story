(thirdQuint)Compassionate Use of Beclomethasone in Treating Patients With Graft-Versus-Host Disease of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

 OBJECTIVES: - Provide beclomethasone dipropionate to patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease refractory to standard therapy or with a contraindication to systemic steroids.

 - Minimize the serious side effects associated with systemic steroid use in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily for 28 days in the absence of graft-versus-host disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients may then receive a second course for 31 days if symptoms of graft-versus-host disease persist.

 Patients may receive up to 4 treatments (1 or 2 courses each) per year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
