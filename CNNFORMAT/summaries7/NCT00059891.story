(thirdQuint)Anal Sphincter Prosthesis in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Anal or Rectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the risk of complications and feasibility of total anorectal reconstruction using the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis after abdominoperineal resection in patients with anal or rectal cancer.

 - Determine continence, bowel function, and quality of life of patients treated with this surgery.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo abdominoperineal resection (APR) with perineal colostomy and diverting loop ileostomy.

 At least 3 months after APR, patients undergo placement of the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis.

 At least 6 weeks after prosthesis placement, the prosthesis is activated.

 When the patient demonstrates the ability to operate the prosthesis, the ileostomy is reversed.

 Quality of life is assessed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

 Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

 Anal Sphincter Prosthesis in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Anal or Rectal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: An anal sphincter prosthesis may replace the need for a permanent colostomy and may improve the quality of life of patients who are undergoing surgery for anal or rectal cancer.

 PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of an anal sphincter prosthesis in treating patients who have anal or rectal cancer and are undergoing surgery to remove the anus and rectum.
