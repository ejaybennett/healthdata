(fifthQuint)LMP-specific T-cells for Patients With Relapsed EBV-positive Lymphoma.

 Investigators will first test a biopsy of the tumor or lymph node that has already been done to see if the tumor or tissue cells are EBV positive.

 If the patient is eligible, investigators will then take 60 mL (about 12 teaspoons) of blood from the patient or their donor on one or two occasions.

 They will use this blood to grow T cells.

 First they will grow a special type of cells called dendritic cells or monocytes which will stimulate the T cells.

 Next they will put a specially produced human virus that carries the LMP genes into the dendritic cells or monocytes.

 They will then be used to stimulate T cells.

 This stimulation will train the T cells to kill cells with LMP on their surface.

 Investigators will then grow these LMP specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells.

 These EBV infected cells will be treated with radiation so they cannot grow.

 Once sufficient numbers of T cells have been made, investigators will test them to make sure they kill cells with LMP on their surface.

 If the counts are low they may need to obtain additional blood samples to make these cells.

 Prior to giving the patient the CTLs, the cells will be tested to make sure they don't attack the tissue.

 The cells will then be thawed and injected into the patient over 10 minutes.

 Initially, two doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart.

 If after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if the patient wishes.

 This is a dose escalation study which means that for some patients the second dose may be larger than the first.

 All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital.

 The patient will followed after the injections.

 They will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by a research nurse yearly for 5 years.

 To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 mL (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each infusion, and then 4 hours after each infusion (optional) and 3-4 days after each infusion (optional) and then weekly for 2 weeks after each infusion (total of 9 times).

 Two weeks after the last infusion, blood will then be taken again and then every 3 months for 1 year, then once a year for 5 years.

 Investigators will use this blood to see how long the T cells last and to look at the immune response to the patient's cancer.

 LMP-specific T-cells for Patients With Relapsed EBV-positive Lymphoma@highlight

Patients have a type of lymph gland disease (HD or NHL, Lymphoepithelioma, severe chronic active EBV (SCAEBV), or leiomyosarcoma) which has come back or may come back or has not gone away after treatment, including the best treatment known for these diseases.

 This research study uses special immune system cells called LMP- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a new experimental therapy.

 Some patients with Lymphoma or SCAEBV or leiomyosarcoma show evidence of infection with the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their diagnosis.

 EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with Hodgkin's and NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma.

 The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some B cells (in SCAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.

 Investigators want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

 The Investigators have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow or solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma.

 In this type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface.

 The investigators grew T cells in the lab that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma.

 However, in HD and NHL and SCAEBV, the tumor cells and B cells only express 2 EBV proteins.

 In a previous study, T cells were made that recognized all 9 proteins and were given to patients with HD.

 Some patients had a partial response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response.

 The investigators think one reason may be that many of the T cells reacted with proteins that were not on the tumor cells.

 In this study, they are trying to find out if they can improve this treatment by growing T cells that recognize proteins expressed on EBV infected Lymphoma cells and B cells called LMP-1 and LMP2.

 These special T cells are called LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).

 These LMP-specific cytotoxic T cells are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.

 The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of LMP-specific cytotoxic T cells, to learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help patients with HD, NHL, Lymphoepithelioma, SCAEBV or leiomyosarcoma.
