 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 - Phase I: Students, family members, teachers, and health providers participate in focus groups to provide system design and implementation input and to assess overall acceptability of a prototype Internet-based application for pediatric cancer patients.

 - Phase II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups, based on participating center.

 - Group 1: Patients have access to and utilize the Internet-based application @neWorld.

 - Group 2: Patients do not have access to or utilize @neWorld.
