(secondQuint)Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the targeting, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in patients with progressive small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

 Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MOAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-4.

 Patients also receive indium In III MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4 and then undergo gamma camera imaging.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6-12 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients with progressive small cell lung cancer.
