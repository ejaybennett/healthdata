(secondQuint)The Guardcontrol Trial: Study to Assess if Type 1 Diabetics Can Improve Using the Real-Time Values of Guardian RT.

 Finger-stick based self-testing (SBGM), as well as diagnostic continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS(R)) allow diabetic patients to find a balance between the two hyper- and hypoglycemic extremes.

 Nevertheless, there are still patients who fail to achieve good control due to fear of hypoglycemia, or who underestimate post-prandial hyperglycemias.

 The Guardian(R) RT Telemetered Glucose Monitoring System is indicated for continuous or periodic monitoring of real-time interstitial blood glucose values and low/high blood glucose alarms (when pre-set levels are reached) in persons with diabetes mellitus.

 The glucose values calculated by the device will be used to trigger hypo- and hyperglycemia alerts and will be displayed every 5 minutes.

 The Guardian(R) RT stores up to 21 days of data.

 The overall primary objective of the study is to determine whether patients with poor glycemic control as evidenced by HbA1c > 8.

1% can achieve improved metabolic control using the real-time values of the Guardian(R) RT compared to conventional self-monitoring blood glucose finger-sticks (control group) after 12 weeks of continuous use.
