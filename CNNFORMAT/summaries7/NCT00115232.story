(fifthQuint)Inflammatory Profiles of Children at High Risk for Atherosclerosis.

 Family history is a well known risk factor for early atherosclerosis.

 Whether inflammation plays a role in the increased risk of family history is not known.

 In this prospective single-center study, we are recruiting children with and without a family history of premature atherosclerotic disease, defined as occurring R2).

 In this sample of high-risk overweight children, Lp(a) and inflammatory markers could reflect cardiovascular risk outside lipid profiles.

 Inflammatory Profiles of Children at High Risk for Atherosclerosis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate levels of inflammatory mediators in children at risk for cardiovascular disease due to family history.

 We are measuring inflammatory markers in two groups of children and their parents: children with a family history of early atherosclerotic heart disease (cases), and healthy children without such a family history (controls).

 The design is a cross-sectional study, gathering a fasting blood sample and clinical and behavioral data on children and a parent.
