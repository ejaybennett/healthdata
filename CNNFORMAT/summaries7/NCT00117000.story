(secondQuint)The Effects of Testosterone and Nutritional Supplementation in the Undernourished Elderly.

 We hypothesize that oral androgen therapy and nutritional supplementation will have additive beneficial effects in older malnourished individuals living in the community; there will be a reduction in hospitalizations, falls and weight loss in association with improvements in functional measures and increases in lean body mass.

 The present study is designed to examine the effect of 12 months oral nutrition supplementation and androgen therapy, alone and combined, on (i) frequency and length of hospitalisations; (ii) functional status; (iii) body composition and weight; (iv) living arrangements; (v) death rate, in community dwelling under-nourished men and women, 65 years and older.
