(secondQuint)Natural History of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug and Non-Helicobacter Pylori in Bleeding Peptic Ulcers.

 Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), Non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) bleeding peptic ulcers are relatively common in the West (11%-44%).

 It is uncommon in Hong Kong (4%).

 Significant number of these patients with non-NSAID, non-Hp bleeding ulcers had co-morbid illness and many had life-threatening conditions.

 Our recent study showed that there is an increasing incidence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter pylori (Hp) bleeding peptic ulcers.

 There is no datum on the natural course of these patients and this is our aim to have this observational study.
