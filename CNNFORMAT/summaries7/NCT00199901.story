(firstQuint)Study of NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX in Patients With High-risk, Resected Melanoma.

 NY-ESO-1 protein is an immune target found in many cancers including melanoma.

 ISCOMATRIX(R) adjuvant enhances immune responses.

 This trial compares NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX(R) vaccine with ISCOMATRIX(R) adjuvant alone to assess whether treatment with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX(R) vaccine improves outcomes for participants with Malignant Melanoma which has been removed, but is at high risk of recurrence.

 Eligible participants are randomly allocated to a treatment arm.

 Treatment involves four intramuscular (into a muscle) injections (1 injection every 4 weeks x 3, plus 1 injection at 6 months).

 Participants are assessed for recurrence of melanoma, safety and immune responses (by blood test) over the 18 month study period.

 Off study, their own doctor will follow them for melanoma recurrence and survival.
