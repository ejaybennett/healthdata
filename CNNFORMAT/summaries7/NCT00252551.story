 Randomized, comparative study on 152 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis L4-L5 confirmed by radiography with radicular pain for whom the antalgic and anti-inflammatory treatment are not efficient for at least 3 months.

 Patients randomized in 2 parallel groups (each group with 76 patients) - one group with decompressive surgery + osteosynthesis - one group with decompressive surgery Study duration : 18 months, including a selection visit, an inclusion with the surgical intervention, 3, 12, 18 months' follow up visits and a follow up call at 6 months.
