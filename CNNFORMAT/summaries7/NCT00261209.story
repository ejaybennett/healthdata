(firstQuint)Collagenase in the Treatment of Zone II Flexor Tendon Adhesions in the Hand.

 In an open label study, collagenase injection therapy was investigated in 3 subjects for it's ability to lyse flexor tendon adhesions in zone II of the hand.

 Results indicate that two of three subjects had improved range of finger motion at the PIP and DIP joints.

 This may obviate the need for patients to have tenolysis hand surgery to correct the finger flexion contracture of the PIP and DIP joints.

 Detailed controlled studies remain to be done.
