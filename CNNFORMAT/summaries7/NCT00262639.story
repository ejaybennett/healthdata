(fifthQuint)Prometa Protocol for Alcohol Dependence.

 Approximately 60 alcohol dependent individuals who are drinking heavily up until 72 hours, or less, prior to study participation will be randomized to receive either flumazenil (intravenously)on two successive days and gabapentin (orally)for 39 days or their matching placebos.

 They also will receive hydroxyzine and vitamins.

 Individuals will be evaluated for alcohol withdrawal, their response to acoustic startle, cognitive ability, craving, mood, sleep and drinking during the first week.

 They will then be seen weekly for about 6 weeks during which they take gabapentin or placebo and are provided with Combined Behavioral Intervention Therapy (counseling) once a week, or more, as required.

 Over this period they will be evaluated weekly for alcohol consumption, craving, sleep, mood, and biological markers of alcohol consumption ( percent carbohydrate deficient transferrin and gamma-glutamyl transferase).

 Blood will be obtained on week 3 and 6 for general health (liver, blood count etc.

) screening.

 After the end of treatment, subjects will be followed-up at 4 weeks and again at 8 weeks after treatment to evaluate alcohol consumption, craving, sleep, mood.

 Subjects will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure sometime during the second or third week of study medication to assess cue induced regional brain activation to investigate the effect of medication on brain response to alcohol visual cues.

 Prometa Protocol for Alcohol Dependence@highlight

This is a placebo controlled trial (some people receive active and some people receive inactive medication) to evaluate the effectiveness of a new protocol to treat alcohol dependence.

 Two main medications (plus ancillary non-placebo controlled medications) and their placebos (inactive drugs) will be utilized to treat both alcohol withdrawal, promote abstinence, and reduce drinking over approximately a six-week treatment period.

 All participants will meet criteria for Alcohol Dependence and be drinking heavily up until 72 hours prior to receiving the first study drug.

 They will be injected one drug (flumazenil or placebo) over a two day period and receive the second one (gabapentin or placebo) by mouth for 39 days.

 The main hypothesis is that this protocol will reduce early alcohol withdrawal symptoms and will reduce relapse to drinking and promote abstinence compared to the placebo (inactive) drug group.

 Secondary outcomes that will be evaluated include reduction in craving, improvement in sleep, brain activity and mood.
