(secondQuint)Nerve Function in Older Diabetic Patients Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy for Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine changes in peripheral nerve function in older patients with diabetes and metastatic solid tumors treated with taxane or platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.

 - Determine the extent to which age, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and level of glycemic control predict a differential pattern in outcome beyond the effect of the drugs in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Develop a clinical assessment that would predict whether or not patients with diabetes mellitus are more or less susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy.

 OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal study.

 Patients undergo an interview and clinical evaluation to measure demographic data, cutaneous sensation, gait and balance, vibration, lower extremity muscle strength, orthostatic blood pressure, and glycemic control.

 Patients are evaluated at baseline, every 3 weeks during chemotherapy for up to 4 treatments, and at 2 months after completion of treatment.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Learning about the side effects of chemotherapy may help plan treatment and may help patients live more comfortably.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying nerve function in older diabetic patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic solid tumors.
