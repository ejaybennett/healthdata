(secondQuint)Effect of Metabolic Therapy in Patients With Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease.

 The present study will evaluate the effect of free fatty acid inhibition with Trimetazidine on silent myocardial ischemia and total ischemic burden in coronary artery disease patients with type II diabetes.

 Patients will undergo ambulatory ECG monitoring at baseline and will be randomized to receive on top of thei standard anti-anginal therapy trimetazidine or placebo for 6 months.

 Patients will repeat the ambulatory ECG monitoring at the end of the study.

 Effect of Metabolic Therapy in Patients With Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease@highlight

Patients with coronary artery disease have an abnormal cardiac metabolism.

 The hypothesis of this study is that shifting cardiac metabolism from free fatty acids to glucose will improve myocardial ischemia
