(fifthQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Chromium Picolinate + Biotin on Glucose and Cholesterol Control in T2DM.

 There will be an Initial Pre-Screening Contact, two office visits (Baseline and Final), and two mid-study phone contacts with the subject during the course of the study.

 Volunteers will take either chromium picolinate (600 1/2g Cr) + biotin (2 mg) (n=400) or placebo (n=200) once daily just prior to the morning meal for 90 days.

 Assessments for glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid profiles, and quality of life will be taken at the Baseline Visit.

 After 90 days another set of assessments will be taken at the Final Visit for comparison with the baseline values.

 All subjects will under go a brief physical exam, a medical history assessment, and a comprehensive concomitant medications assessment as well as provide blood and urine samples at the baseline and final visits to ensure subject safety is maintained.

 The subject will be contacted, by a central call center, between visits at Day 30 and Day 60 to ensure study compliance by reminding the subject to take all doses of study product, perform the daily blood glucose monitoring, and complete the study diary daily.

To evaluate the effect of the combination of chromium picolinate (600 1/2g Cr) + biotin (2 mg) versus placebo on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles (Total-C, HDL-C, LDL-C, TGs, TG/HDL ratio, etc), and pharmacoeconomic outcomes as measured at the Baseline Visit and 90 days later at the Final Visit.

 Secondarily, to measure the effect of chromium picolinate (600 1/2g Cr) + biotin (2 mg) versus placebo on patient quality of life, fasting and post-prandial blood sugar levels, fasting insulin, and anti-hyperglycemic medication usage.
