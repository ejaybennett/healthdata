(firstQuint)Protocol for Women at Increased Risk of Developing Breast Cancer.

 A pilot study of letrozole in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high risk of developing breast cancer.

 Subjects will have hyperplasia with atypia (or borderline Epithelial Hyperplasia/Atypical Hyperplasia) and evidence of Estrogen Receptor expression by random periareolar fine needle aspiration and baseline serum estradiol levels less than or equal to 150 pg/ml.

 The feasibility of performing RT-qPCR on breast specimens for aromatase expression will also be done at baseline.
