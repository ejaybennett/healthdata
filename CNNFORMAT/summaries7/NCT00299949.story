(fifthQuint)Thrombin Generation and Thromboelastography in Non-overt DIC.

 Activation of the coagulation system occurs early in patients with sepsis, although clinically overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is identified in only a minority of patients with severe sepsis.

 Uncontrolled activation of the coagulation system may contribute to the pathophysiology of multiple organ failure and the subsequent morbidity and mortality of sepsis.

 Identification of risk factors predicting progression to severe sepsis and DIC has been elusive.

 We propose that whole blood and cell-rich coagulation assays will offer improved sensitivity to both the procoagulant and anti-coagulant changes which occur early in sepsis and will improve recognition of non-overt DIC.

 Future studies will address whether these assays have sufficiently high predictive value to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from early intervention.

 Specific Aims: 1.

 We hypothesize that increased thrombin generation will precede development of overt DIC by a clinically significant time period.

 Our primary objective is to determine if endogenous thrombin potential measured at first diagnosis of sepsis prior to the onset of DIC and organ failure is predictive of overt DIC.

 2.

 There is significant individual variation among the healthy population in endogenous thrombin generation due to known and unknown polymorphisms within coagulation proteins.

 We predict that host variables in thrombin generation will contribute to susceptibility to DIC and poor outcome during sepsis.

 A secondary objective of this study is to determine if host coagulation variables predispose to the morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis.

 Experimental Design and Methods The study design will be a prospective observational study of patients presenting to the Memorial Hermann Hospital Emergency Department with sepsis.

 Criteria for sepsis include evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome as defined by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference, and a known or suspected infection.

 Exclusion criteria include signs of severe sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference, at presentation, including: organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion and perfusion abnormalities.

 Chronic medical conditions associated with immune suppression or coagulopathies, such as neutropenia and sickle cell disease, and use of medications leading to immune dysfunction or coagulopathies, such as chronic steroid use or anti-coagulation will also be reasons for exclusion.

 In addition, because of the volume of blood required from each patient for laboratory studies, only patients 25 kg body weight or more will be enrolled.

 Withdrawal from the study will be at the discretion of the treating physician or subject.

 All efforts will be made to collect clinical information from patients who have withdrawn.

 Inclusion criteria - Known or suspected infection as determined by the treating physician Patient to be admitted to the hospital - Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome: 3 of the following 4 criteria: - Temperature > 38 C or 90 beats/min, except in patients with a medical condition known to increase the heart rate or those receiving treatment that would prevent tachycardia.

 - Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or PaC02 12,000/mm3, 10% bands Exclusion criteria - - Use of the following medications: unfractionated heparin to treat an active thrombotic event within 8 hours before the infusion; low-molecular-weight heparin at a higher dose than recommended for prophylactic use within 12 hours before the infusion, warfarin used within 7 days of study entry, aspirin use at a dose of more than 650 mg/day within 3 days before the study, thrombolytic therapy within 3 days before the study, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists within 7 days before the study entry, administration of activated protein C (Xigris ) in the 24 hours before study entry.

 - Neutropenia - Hemophilia - Diabetic ketoacidosis - Weight 5) or No (score < 5).

 A receiver operating curve will be derived for ETP and MCT and its sensitivity and specificity for predicting DIC.

 If the area under the curve is found to be significant, an optimal cut-off value with the highest degree of accuracy will be chosen.

 This value will be used to estimate the predictive value of the test.

 Positive predictive value will be calculated with the formula: # patients with ETP or MCT above the cut-off and development of DIC / # patients with positive DIC score.

 The predictive value of a negative DIC score will be calculated using the formula: # patients with ETP or MCT below the cut-off and no progression to DIC / # patients with negative DIC score.

 Specific Aim #2: A multivariate analysis will be done to determine which of the predictor variables (ETP, MCT, Pro C, Pro S, ATIII, FVL, ProG20210A, DIC) are associated with the secondary dichotomous outcome measures: organ dysfunction at 28 days (Any/None), 28-day mortality (Dead/Alive).

 Thrombin Generation and Thromboelastography in Non-overt DIC@highlight

Sepsis is the 13th most common cause of death in the United States, causing approximately 210,000 deaths per year.

 Once DIC has developed, irreversible organ injury has already occurred and the mortality rate is 70%.

 Inhibition of systemic coagulation with activated protein C concentrate has been the only therapy for sepsis introduced in the past several decades which has improved outcomes.

 Elucidation of the coagulopathic mechanisms early in the development of DIC may give rise to targeted therapies and strategies for early intervention.

 We hypothesize that an increase in endogenous thrombin potential precedes the development of overt DIC by a clinically significant time period.

 Our primary objective is to determine if endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) measured at first diagnosis of sepsis prior to the onset of DIC and organ failure is predictive of overt DIC and/or poor outcome.

 We will compare ETP to standard coagulation assays and the clinical assessment of DIC using the ISTH criteria for overt DIC.

 A secondary objective of this study is to determine if host coagulation variables predispose to the development of DIC and poor clinical outcome during sepsis.
