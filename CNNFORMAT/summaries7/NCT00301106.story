(thirdQuint)Biological Therapy in Treating Women With Breast Cancer That Has Spread to the Liver.

 Direct intratumoral injection of metastatic hepatic tumors using an adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene (Adv.

RSV-hIL12, also termed ADV-hIL-12).

 OBJECTIVES: - Study the toxicity of escalating doses of adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene, administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection, in women with liver metastasis secondary to breast cancer.

 - Determine tumor responses produced by this regimen.

 - Determine immune responses induced by this regimen.
