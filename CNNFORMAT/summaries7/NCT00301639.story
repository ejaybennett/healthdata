(thirdQuint)A PET Study Examining Pharmacokinetics and Dopamine Transporter Receptor Occupancy Of Two Long-Acting Formulations of Methylphenidate in Adults.

 OROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH over the day (ascending pharmacokinetic curve).

 It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID treatment.

 Another new long-acting formulation is Metadate CD.

 Metadate CD consists of capsules with two types of beads.

 It was designed to replace IR-MPH BID treatment.

 The main target of MPH in the brain is the dopamine transporter (DAT).

 We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

 The time course of decay of the C-11 Altropane permits repeated imaging, thus allowing documentation of the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy.

The specific aim of this study is to document the pharmacokinetics of dopamine transporter DAT receptor occupancy of OROS MPH and Metadate CD using PET scanning with C-11 Altropane as the ligand.

 We hypothesize that CNS DAT occupancy of OROS MPH will be greater than that of Metadate CD at 10 hours after administration.
