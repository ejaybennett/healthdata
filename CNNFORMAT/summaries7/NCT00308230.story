(secondQuint)Pilot Study of B-Type Natrieutic Peptide (BNP) Levels in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease(BNP).

 Enrollment: Patients with congenital heart disease seen at Emory Clinics, Adult Congenital Heart Disease program, Crawford Long Hospital will be asked to participate in this pilot study.

 Sample size: 20 patients (5 in each group) Screening Phase: Demographic data, medical history, physical examination including vital signs and room air oxygen saturation, and medications will be recorded.

 New York Heart association functional class will be recorded.

 BNP Levels: Approximately 7 cc of blood will be collected.

 The blood will be analyzed for B-type natriuretic peptide on a rapid assay in the clinic.

 Exercise Tolerance: will be measured by a 6 minute walk test on day of visit Echocardiogram: A complete echocardiogram including assessment of anatomy, ventricular function and valvular function will be performed following the phlebotomy.

 Quality of life: The minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire will be administered on the day of collection of neurohormonal levels.

 A research nurse will be available to assist the patient if needed.
