(thirdQuint)Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Follicular or Marginal Zone Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the local progression-free interval in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with 2 different regimens of low-dose radiotherapy.

 Secondary - Compare acute toxicity at 4 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Compare late toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Compare tumor response at 12 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Compare overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

 - Assess the health economics of these regimens in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 - Arm I 4Gy: Patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy once daily on days 1 and 2.

 - Arm II 24Gy: Patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15, and 16.

 In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 5 years.

 Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 650 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Follicular or Marginal Zone Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells.

 It is not yet known which regimen of low-dose radiation therapy is more effective in treating follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different regimens of low-dose radiation therapy (24Gy versus 4Gy) to compare how well they work in treating patients with follicular or marginal zone non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
