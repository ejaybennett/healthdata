(fifthQuint)Study to Asses DTPw-HBV/Hib at 15-18 Months (m) and Mencevax ACW at 24 to 30 m in Primed Subjects.

 This open study will have two parallel groups based on the vaccination received in the primary study: AC primed Group: primed with Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine and AC unprimed Group (control): primed with Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hiberix cent vaccine.

 All subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix cent -HepB/Hiberix cent vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age with GSK Biological's OPV vaccine given concomitantly and a dose of Mencevax cent ACW vaccine at 24 to 30 months of age.

 Blood sampling will be done prior to (pre) and one month after (post) the Mencevax cent ACW vaccine administration for immunogenicity analyses.

 The study will last minimum 7 to maximum 16 months per subject.

 Mencevax cent ACWY was changed to Mencevax cent ACW throughout the posting to correct an inconsistency in the earlier version of the protocol posting and to reflect the actual situation.
