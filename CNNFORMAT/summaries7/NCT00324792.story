(firstQuint)I3LTE4: Intensive Insulin Therapy and Production of LTE4 in Patients With Diabetes.

 Our group has recently reported the results of a preliminary cross-sectional study, which demonstrated that the urinary LTE4 excretion is increased in patients with type 1 diabetes.

 With regard to recent human genetic studies showing that polymorphisms in the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) promoter and FLAP haplotypes is linked to cardiovascular disease susceptibility our data suggested the potential interest of LTE4 as a non-invasive biomarker of cardiovascular risk.

 In diabetes mellitus, further studies are required to evaluate the 5-LO pathway after improvement of glucose control and concomitantly with established inflammatory cardiovascular biomarkers.

 The secondary objectives are: Before and after 3-month intensive insulin therapy- Relationship between a marker of platelet activation (urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxan B2 :11-dehydroTXB2) and urinary LTE4- Relationship between inflammatory plasma markers of cardiovascular risk (hs-CRP and fibrinogen) and urinary LTE4- Relationship between a plasma marker of endothelial dysfunction (sICAM-1) and urinary LTE4- Changes in LTE4 according to patient subgroups (patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus).

The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of a 3-month intensive insulin therapy on urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) excretion in patients with diabetes.
