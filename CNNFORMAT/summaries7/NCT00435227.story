(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate a Single IM Dose of Motavizumab Treatment of Children With RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) Illness.

 This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to determine the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on viral load and motavizumab levels in the upper respiratory tract of children who present with RSV illness but who do not require hospitalization.

 Using 1:1 randomization, 30 mg/kg motavizumab or placebo will be administered as soon as possible after a child's diagnosis of RSV and his/her eligibility for the study has been confirmed.

 A Study to Evaluate a Single IM Dose of Motavizumab Treatment of Children With RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) Illness@highlight

- The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of a single (IM) dose of motavizumab in the upper respiratory tract in children who present with RSV illness but who do not require hospitalization at the time of presentation and - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in decreasing the need for hospitalization due to worsening RSV illness in children who receive outpatient treatment - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on subsequent respiratory status as measured by the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) and change in oxygen saturation - For children who require hospitalization, describe the effect of motavizumab on severity of RSV illness during hospitalization [i.

e.

, RACS, oxygen saturation, heart rate, use of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay] - Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on duration of symptoms of RSV illness (fever, coryza, cough, and parental opinion of return to normal health and activity) - Describe the nasal concentration of motavizumab following a single 30mg/kg dose - Describe the serum pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab - Describe the effect of motavizumab on markers of inflammation as measured by gene microarray and cytokine levels - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in the outpatient treatment of children with RSV - Describe the progression and severity of lower respiratory infection (LRI)
