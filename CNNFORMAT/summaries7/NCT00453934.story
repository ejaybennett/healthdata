(thirdQuint)Patient Preference of h-Patch vs.

 Pen or Needle/Syringe as Insulin Administration Device.

 Patients with Type 1 Diabetes have an absolute deficiency in insulin production and benefit from physiologic insulin replacement, defined as administration of background and mealtime insulin.

 More than half of patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have less than 50% of their beta cell function at the time of diagnosis.

 Because of this, these patients would also benefit from the physiologic delivery of insulin.

 Currently, 4 or more injections per day are required to deliver the various different available insulins in a physiologic manner.

 Valeritas has developed the h-Patch, a device suitable to make the delivery of basal and bolus insulin effective, simple and discrete.

 This study will measure patient preference, glucose control and safety of the h-Patch compared with patients' previous therapy.

 Patients previous therapy will be multiple daily injections delivered either by pens or needle and syringe.

 Patient Preference of h-Patch vs.

 Pen or Needle/Syringe as Insulin Administration Device@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to compare patient preference of the h-Patch as delivery device for insulin lispro compared with either an insulin pen or needle and syringe in patients with diabetes, either Type 1 or Type 2, on stable multiple daily injection regimens.

 This will be assessed using an accepted preference scale.
