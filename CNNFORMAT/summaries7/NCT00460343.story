(secondQuint)Pharmacy Implementation Trial: Adherence to Antihypertensive Therapy.

 Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in large parts of the world.

 Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 Although hypertension treatment has improved in the last decade, the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy still needs attention.

 Adherence to medication appears to play an important role in that.

 Pharmacists can support the general practitioners in their efforts to optimize antihypertensive therapy, by establishing adherence to medication of patients with hypertension in spite of the use of one or more antihypertensive drugs.

 This is performed with the electronic Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS(R)).

 Registered adherence and accompanying blood pressure are discussed with the patient by the GP.

 Implementation of the above-mentioned intervention is studied in two randomized groups of pharmacies.

 One group receives minimal support in the intervention, the other group also receives interactive educational meetings, reminders and feedback, and support of multiprofessional cooperation.
