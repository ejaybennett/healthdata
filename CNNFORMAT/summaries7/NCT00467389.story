(firstQuint)Use of Donepezil for Treatment of Cocaine Dependence.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, inpatient, single-center, parallel group evaluation of the potential for oral donepezil to attenuate cocaine-induced craving.

 Non-treatment-seeking cocaine-experienced volunteers will receive baseline treatment with intravenous cocaine (30Mg).

 Forty-two subjects that tolerate baseline cocaine infusions will then receive two subsequent intravenous doses of cocaine during double-blind treatment with oral placebo or 5 mg daily of donepezil.

 Each dose of cocaine will be preceded or followed by administration of intravenous placebo (saline) in a random order.
