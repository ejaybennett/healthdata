(fifthQuint)Pilot Study of a Multi-Drug Regimen for Severe Pulmonary Fibrosis in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome.

 Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of oculocutaneous albinism and a platelet storage pool defect.

 The most serious complication of this disorder, pulmonary fibrosis, occurs only in genetic subtypes HPS-1 and HPS-4 and is generally fatal in the fourth or fifth decade.

 HPS-1 is very common in northwest Puerto Rico.

 There is no effective treatment for the pulmonary disease of HPS (HPS-PF), which resembles idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

 A preliminary study of the antifibrotic drug, pirfenidone, gave promising results for mild to moderate HPS-PF, but not for severe pulmonary fibrosis.

 A second study is currently addressing only mild to moderate HPS-PF.

 Other drugs, studied in IPF as single agents, have some efficacy for mild to moderate disease, but none has had a major effect on mortality.

 Recently, a call has been made for consideration of multi-drug therapy (i.

e.

, an oncologic approach) for severe pulmonary fibrosis.

 Based upon positive responses from companies producing relevant drugs, we propose a multi-drug trial using five agents: Losartan, Zileuton, a generic statin (Pravastatin), generic N-acetylcysteine, and generic Erythromycin.

 Participants with severe pulmonary fibrosis will be drawn largely from the Puerto Rican population.

 Eligibility will require a molecular diagnosis of HPS-1 or HPS-4, radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease, persistent pulmonary function testing less than or equal to 45% of predicted after bronchodilation, and absence of other causes of lung dysfunction.

 Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 21-day admission to establish baseline function and to begin medication therapy.

 Follow-up admissions (3 days) will occur every 3 months.

 The primary outcome parameter will be survival at 2 years.

 Pilot Study of a Multi-Drug Regimen for Severe Pulmonary Fibrosis in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome@highlight

This study will examine whether five drugs (pravastatin, Losartan, Zileuton, N-acetylcysteine and erythromycin) used together can slow the course of pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung tissue) in patients with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS).

 Patients with this disease have decreased skin color (albinism), bleeding problems, and sometimes colon problems.

 Two of the known types of Hermansky Pudlak syndrome, type 1 and type 4, are at high risk of pulmonary fibrosis between the ages of 30 and 50.

 Patients 18 to 70 years of age who have Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome with a serious loss of lung function due to pulmonary fibrosis may be eligible for this study.

 Participants begin taking pravastatin on study day 2 and start a new drug every 3 days.

 Patients who experience no problems with the medicines return home and continue on the drugs for the next 2 years.

 They return to the NIH Clinical Center every 3 months for a medical history, physical examination, and blood, urine and lung function tests.

 CT and bone density scans are done every year.

 The study may continue for up to 3 years.
