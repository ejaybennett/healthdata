(thirdQuint)Peginterferon Alfa-2a, Ribavirin and Epoetin  in Coinfected Patients HCV/HIV Not Responding to Previous Treatment Regimens.

 The purpose in treating chronic HCV infection in HIV-coinfected individuals is to clear HCV-RNA antibodies and cure the infection.

 Studies have shown that high doses of ribavirin are associated with higher response rates than those achieved with ribavirin at dosages of 800-1200 mg/d.

 The main aim of this trial is to assess the sustained virologic response to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus high-dose ribavirin in HIV-infected patients coinfected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 who have had persistent transaminase elevations and lack of response to previous treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin at dosages of 800-1200 mg/d.

 The second aim will be to measure changes in serum HCV-RNA titers and the percentage of patients achieving serum viral loads of < 50 IU/mL during treatment.

 Finally, we also intend to evaluate the safety of this treatment regimen.

 Peginterferon Alfa-2a, Ribavirin and Epoetin  in Coinfected Patients HCV/HIV Not Responding to Previous Treatment Regimens@highlight

This trial will assess the sustained virologic response to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a combined with high-dose ribavirin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 or 4 coinfection and persistent transaminase elevations.

 These patients will have been nonresponders to previous regimens with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy at a dosage of 800-1200 mg/d.
