(secondQuint)Post-transplant Autologous Cytokine-induced Killer (CIK) Cells for Treatment of High Risk Hematologic Malignancies.

 Disease relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure in autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk disease.

 Relapse after autologous transplant is in part due to the persistence of residual cancer cells.

 Cellular immunotherapy using activated autologous effector cells to recognize and kill tumor targets in a minimal disease state after transplant is a strategy being explored to reduce relapse and improve survival.

 We hypothesize that cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell-based immunotherapy can reduce the relapse rate after high-risk autologous stem cell transplantation by treating post-transplant minimal residual disease.

The purpose of the study is to conduct a phase I study of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous, ex-vivo expanded cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells to reduce the relapse rate in autologous stem cell transplant patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.
