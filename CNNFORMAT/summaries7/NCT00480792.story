(fifthQuint)Trial Comparing Three Strategies of Vaccination Against the Virus of Hepatitis B in HIV Infected Patients.

 Comparison of 3 vaccination strategy against Hepatitis B in patients with HIV infection T CD4 above 200 per mm3 Intervention: 1.

 Arm A: GenHevac-B 20 microgramme Intramuscular use at M0, M1, M6 2.

 Arm B: GenHevac-B 40 microgramme Intramuscular use at M0, M1, M2, M6 3.

 Arm C: GenHevac-B 4 microgramme Intradermal use at M0, M1, M2, M6.

 Trial Comparing Three Strategies of Vaccination Against the Virus of Hepatitis B in HIV Infected Patients@highlight

In HIV infected patients, individuals exposed to the virus of Hepatitis B are more susceptible to develop a chronic and severe liver disease with a major risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

 However, the existing protocol of vaccination against Hepatitis B is less efficient in HIV-infected patients than in non HIV-infected-patients, and, in case of response, its longevity has to be followed up carefully.

 This study compares the efficacy of the standard protocol vaccination with GenHevac-B and 2 other protocols, a double-dose of GenHevac-B and a set of intradermal injections of Genhevac-B, in HIV-infected patients with lymphocytes T CD4 level above 200 permm3.
