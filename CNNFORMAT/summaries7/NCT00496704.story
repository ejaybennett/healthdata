(fifthQuint)Gemcitabine, Capecitabine, and Oxaliplatin as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Previously Treated With Irinotecan.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Define the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride when administered with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with irinotecan hydrochloride.

 (Phase I) - Determine the recommended phase II dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride in these patients.

 (Phase I) - Assess overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) Secondary - Assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) - Assess the time to treatment failure, duration of response, and time to response in patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) - Assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 (Phase II) - Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride, followed by a phase II, open-label study.

 - Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.

 Courses repeat every 21 days.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 - Phase II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride at the MTD determined in phase I and capecitabine and oxaliplatin as in phase I.

 Gemcitabine, Capecitabine, and Oxaliplatin as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Previously Treated With Irinotecan@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine when given together with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with irinotecan.
