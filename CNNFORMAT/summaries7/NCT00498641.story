(firstQuint)Anisometropia Amblyopia Improved by Perceptual Learning and Patching.

 Patients with anisometropic amblyopia were randomized to patching or perceptual learning group.

 Corrected amblyopic logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function were measured at four-weekly intervals until visual acuity stabilized or amblyopia resolved.

 Improvement in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and the resolution of amblyopia were compared between groups.
