(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Ultrase MT20 in Improving the Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA) in Children With Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Pancreatic Insufficiency (PI).

 This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study, which will quantify the improvement of nutrient absorption when participants are receiving Ultrase(R) MT20.

 The improvement will be demonstrated by comparing the CFA percent (%) and CNA% obtained during a washout of enzyme with the CFA% and CNA% obtained during a period of treatment with Ultrase(R) MT20.

 The study is also designed to obtain safety data in CF children suffering also from PI taking Ultrase(R) MT20.

 The total duration for the participation of children in this study will be approximately up to 38 days and will include 3 phases: screening phase, the washout phase and treatment phase.

 Screening phase: this phase will last 15 days and all participants will take Ultrase(R) MT20 as per investigator's discretion during this period.

 During the last 4 days, participants will be stabilized on a high fat diet and with Ultrase(R) MT20.

 The individual 'stabilized dose' of Ultrase(R) MT20 capsules will be determined for each participant based on the average number of capsules of Ultrase(R) MT20 taken during last 4 days.

 Washout phase: this phase will last 6 to 7 days.

 The participants will continue the high-fat diet but will refrain from taking Ultrase(R) MT20 or any other enzymes.

 A 72-hour stool collection will be performed and all food consumed by the participants will be recorded to assess the CFA% and CNA%.

 Treatment phase: this phase will last 7 to 11 days.

 The participants will continue the high-fat diet and will take the 'stabilized dose' of Ultrase(R) MT20 established during screening.

 Another 72-hour stool collection will be performed and all food consumed by the participants will be recorded to assess the CFA% and CNA%.

This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study, that will evaluate the improvement of nutrient absorption when participants will receive Ultrase(R) MT20.

 This study is sponsored by Aptalis (formerly Axcan).

 This study is performed in children from 7 to 11 years old.
