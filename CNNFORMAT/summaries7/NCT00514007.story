(firstQuint)Study of Continuous OSI-906 Dosing.

 Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation.

 The study will open with the QD schedule, with initiation of the BID schedule occurring after observation of clinically significant related toxicity grade 2 in the QD schedule.

 Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with daily dosing (either QD or BID) continuing for 21 days.

 Once the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined for the BID schedule, 2 expansion cohorts will be opened: 1) Biomarker Expansion Cohort in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer and 2) Diabetic Expansion Cohort in patients with advanced solid tumors who have active Type 2 diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin or insulinotropic therapy.

 This study is currently only recruiting to the Biomarker and Diabetic Expansion Cohorts.
