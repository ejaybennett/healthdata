(thirdQuint)Radiolabeled Glass Beads in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery.

 OBJECTIVES: - Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R)) to eligible patients with cancer of the liver who are not candidates for surgical resection.

 - Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R)) treatment.

 OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

 Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere(R)) into the liver tumor through a percutaneously placed catheter into the hepatic artery.

 Patients may receive additional treatment 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 weeks, 30 days, and then once a year for approximately 2 years.

RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.

 Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiolabeled glass beads work in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
