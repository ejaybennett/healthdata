(thirdQuint)Positron Emission Tomography Using [18F]-Labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor Quantifier in Finding Disease in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier positron emission tomography can identify pancreatic cancer evident on multiphase CT scan.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo multiphase CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 No more than 15 days later, patients receive [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier IV and undergo positron emission tomography over 6 hours.

 Blood is collected periodically to measure the metabolism of the radiotracer by high performance liquid chromatography with radioactive detectors.

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier, may be effective in finding disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well a PET scan using [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier works in finding disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.
