(firstQuint)Effects of Simvastatin on Biochemical Parameters and Outcome of IVF-ICSI in Pcos Patients.

 simvastatin reduces cardiovascular risks by improving hypercholesterolemia, reducing vascular smooth muscle proliferation, ameliorating inflammation, limiting theca-interstitial proliferation & decreasing steroidogenesis (production of progesterone & testosterone).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is associated with increased cardiovascular risks and is characterized by ovarian theca-interstitial hyperplasia& hyperandrogenism .

This study will test the hypothesis that simvastatin improves biochemical parameters& IVF-ICSI outcome in Pcos patients.

 Effects of Simvastatin on Biochemical Parameters and Outcome of IVF-ICSI in Pcos Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether simvastatin is effective in the improvement of IVF-ICSI outcome in Pcos patients.
