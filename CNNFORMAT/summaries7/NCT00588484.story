(firstQuint)Ultrasound-based Intima-Media Thickness Measurements.

 IMT is measured using software to analyze ECG-gated US image sequences acquired using a standard protocol.

 Two sonographers acquire images and measure IMT for 100 vessels.

 IMT technique standard deviation (SD) is determined by assuming normally distributed measurements, and dividing the SD of the 100 (paired) IMT differences by sqrt(2).

 This SD will be taken as measures of precision of the IMT technique.
