(firstQuint)Evaluation of Vestibular Stimulation to Help Occasional Sleeplessness.

 This 2 arm study will look at the proposed treatment (electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve) versus a sham or placebo device.

 The effect of the device will be evaluated in a study that uses normal sleepers and advances them(puts them to bed 5-hours earlier than normal) to see if they fall asleep faster in one group or the other.

 Stimulation in the treated or sham group is only for the first hour after lights off.

 Evaluation of Vestibular Stimulation to Help Occasional Sleeplessness@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a small electrical current to the vestibular nerve (balance organ) will decrease the time it take for participants to fall asleep.
