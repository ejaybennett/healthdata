(fifthQuint)Locomotor Training in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis.

 In this study, subjects with confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis were randomized into one of two treatment arms.

 Subjects in the Lokomat arm trained on the Lokomat with a supervising physical therapist for 20-30 minutes/session 3 times/week.

 The Lokomat is a robotic exoskeleton which enables the subject to step on a moving treadmill.

 Subjects were suspended in a harness while in the Lokomat with full to partial body weight support as needed.

 After the training in the Lokomat, they practiced overground walking for 10 minutes.

 The other treatment arm had subjects engage in resistance training with weights and resistance elastic bands matched to the Lokomat group for intensity, duration and frequency.

 they did not practice overground walking.

 Primary outcome measure was speed to accomplish 25' timed walk.

 Locomotor Training in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis@highlight

Locomotor training is a new exercise modality that emphasizes task specificity to promote learning and neural plasticity.

 It has been reported to improve walking in patients with stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy.

 In this study, 40 patients with impaired ambulation due to Multiple Sclerosis will be randomized to receive 36 sessions of either locomotor training or an standard resistive exercise intervention.

The locomotor training will be accomplished via a robotic device, the Lokomat, which will move the patient's legs on a treadmill while they are suspended in a harness.
