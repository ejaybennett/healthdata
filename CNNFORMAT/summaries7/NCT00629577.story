(thirdQuint)Gene Expression Profiling of Cervical Cancer Progression in Biopsies and Tissue Samples.

 OBJECTIVES: - Classify cervical cancer progression at a molecular level using gene expression profiling generated from expression microarrays.

 - Profile gene expression changes of dysplasia and early carcinoma of uterine cervical tissue at a molecular level using expression microarrays.

 - Define a set of genes that classify the various grades of cervical cancer/dysplasia at a molecular level.

 - Compare the expression profiles of clinical data to determine how accurately cell lines model the in vivo environment.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo colposcopy and a cervical smear is taken for flow cytometry analysis.

 Patients also undergo 2 biopsies from one clinically abnormal or normal site.

 Tissue samples are analyzed by gene expression profiling using human expression microarrays containing approximately 40,000 unique sequences.

 Data analysis consists of defining a set of genes, containing new targets for biomarkers, that classify the biopsies into 3 grades.

 Gene Expression Profiling of Cervical Cancer Progression in Biopsies and Tissue Samples@highlight

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research trial is studying gene expression profiling of cervical cancer progression in biopsies and tissue samples from patients with cervical lesions.
