(firstQuint)Study of Subcutaneous Methylnaltrexone (MNTX) in the Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation During Rehabilitation After Orthopedic Procedures.

 This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- controlled phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and activity of subcutaneous (SC) MNTX versus SC placebo in subjects who have undergone orthopedic procedures and who are expected to require opioids for one week after randomization.

 Subjects will sign an informed consent form and be screened between Days 4-10 after their orthopedic procedure.

 Those subjects who meet all eligibility requirements will be enrolled in the study.

 Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a four-day treatment of once daily SC MNTX 12 mg or SC placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

 Treatment with study medication will begin on the same day as screening, or no later than the following calendar day.

 All bowel movements and the time of bowel movement will be recorded.

 Treatment with study medication will be continued until either the subject no longer requires opioid medication for pain relief or a maximum of four days (four doses) of treatment is reached.

 Subjects will be given patient diaries at the start of the study.

 Study drug will be transferred from hospitals to rehabilitation facilities for subjects discharged to rehabilitation facilities.
