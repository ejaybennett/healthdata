(firstQuint)Safety of Intravenous Lacosamide Dose Followed by Twice Daily Oral Lacosamide in Subjects With Partial-onset Seizures.

 This multicenter, open-label trial examined safety and tolerability of rapid initiation of adjunctive lacosamide via a single intravenous loading dose followed by oral maintenance treatment in subjects 16 - 60 years of age with partial-onset seizures.

 Three consecutive 25-subject cohorts were given a progressively increasing dose of lacosamide (200, 300, 400 mg) administered as a single 15-minute intravenous (iv) loading dose followed by the equivalent daily dose administered orally twice daily for 6.

5 days with the first oral dose 12 hours after the iv dose.

 A fourth cohort of 25 subjects repeated the 300 mg dose to provide safety data on a total of 50 subjects at the highest well-tolerated dose.
