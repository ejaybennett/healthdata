(thirdQuint)Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare outcomes of patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor that expresses KIT (CD117) treated with low-dose imatinib mesylate vs high-dose imatinib mesylate.

 Secondary - To assess response rates in patients treated with two different doses of imatinib mesylate.

 - To assess the toxicities of two different doses of imatinib mesylate in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to participating center, measurability of disease (measurable vs non-measurable), and WHO performance status (0-2 vs 3).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral imatinib mesylate once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral imatinib mesylate twice daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 In the event of disease progression, patients on arm I may cross over to arm II and receive high-dose imatinib mesylate.

 Patients who continue to progress despite treatment with high-dose imatinib mesylate are removed from the study.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor@highlight

RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 It is not yet known which dose of imatinib mesylate is more effective in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different doses of imatinib mesylate to compare how well they work in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
