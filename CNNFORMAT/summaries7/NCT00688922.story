(secondQuint)Pravastatin for Acute Myocardial Infarction With Minimally to Mildly Increased Levels of Serum Cholesterol Study.

 The investigators previously reported the beneficial effect of early use of low-dose pravastatin on major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction and mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in the OACIS-LIPID Study.

 The PRACTIC study is designed as the OACIS-LIPID II trial to determine whether early treatment with pravastatin can reduce adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction and minimally to mildly elevated serum Low Density Lipoprotein -Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.
