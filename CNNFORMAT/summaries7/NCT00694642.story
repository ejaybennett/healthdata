(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Endothelial Progenitor Cell CD 133 for Therapeutic Angiogenesis.

 The PROGENITOR trial is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter controlled trial including patients with Canadian cardiovascular society angina classification (CCS): II-IV and ischemic zones by SPECT but without any option for revascularization.

 Primary endpoint was to assess the safety and feasibility of transendocardial injection of selected CD133+cells.

 All patients were treated for 4-days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and underwent apheresis.

 CD133+ cells were selected with CliniMacs system and were injected transendocardially guided by the NOGA XP system.
