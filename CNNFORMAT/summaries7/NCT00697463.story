(thirdQuint)Forteo for the Treatment of Unexplained Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women.

 Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) is an uncommon disorder in which otherwise healthy young individuals sustain one or more low-trauma fractures.

 In our studies of IOP in men, histomorphometric indices of bone formation are depressed, and affected men respond to PTH(1-34) with robust increases in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD).

 We are now beginning the third year of an R01 (AR4989603) investigating the etiology and pathogenesis, as well as the histomorphometric and bone microarchitectural features of IOP in premenopausal women.

 We have found evidence of markedly decreased bone formation and microarchitectural deterioration with decreased mechanical competence/strength.

 Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)] is an anabolic agent that stimulates bone formation and improves bone microarchitecture.

 Based upon our findings, we hypothesize that teriparatide will significantly increase BMD and improve microarchitecture in premenopausal women with IOP.

 We will test this hypothesis in an open-label study of carefully characterized premenopausal women with IOP who are participating in our NIH-funded study and who have fragility fractures or very low bone density.

 Participants in the study will receive 18-24 months of teriparatide and the effects on BMD and microstructure, bone mechanical competence, and bone turnover will be assessed.

 In order to assess whether teriparatide stimulates bone formation to the same extent in women with IOP as it does in normal women, we will compare the short-term changes (2 and 4 weeks) in biochemical markers of bone formation in response to teriparatide between women with IOP and normal women who are participating in our NIH-funded study as controls.

 Forteo for the Treatment of Unexplained Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women@highlight

Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) is an uncommon disorder in which otherwise healthy young individuals sustain one or more low-trauma fractures.

 Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)], which is FDA approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, works by stimulating bone formation.

 We hypothesize that teriparatide will significantly increase bone density (BMD) and improve bone structure in premenopausal women with IOP.
