(firstQuint)A Trial of Single Dose Corifollitropin Alfa's Ability to Induce Multiple Follicular Growth During the First Week of Controlled Ovarian Stimulation for IVF or ICSI (38833)(P05788).

 In this trial, all subjects were (pre)treated daily with subcutaneous triptorelin, a GnRH agonist which is known to provide profound suppression of endogenous LH and FSH.

 It was evaluated whether these down-regulated subjects show an appropriate ovarian response to 100 1/2g or 150 1/2g Org 36286 during the first week of stimulation.

 To evaluate this, follicular growth was measured by USS, and serum inhibin-B and E2 levels were assessed.
