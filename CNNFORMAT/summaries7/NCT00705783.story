(fifthQuint)Intramuscular Depot Formulation of Aripiprazole as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a screening phase and 4 treatment phases.

 Eligibility was determined during a screening phase of 2 to 42 days.

 Patients receiving oral treatment with an antipsychotic other than non-generic aripiprazole entered Phase 1.

 Patients with a lapse in aripiprazole or other antipsychotic treatment at the time of study entry ("lapse" defined as > 3 consecutive days without medication) entered directly into Phase 2.

 During Phase 1 (oral conversion), patients were cross-titrated during weekly visits from other antipsychotics to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy over a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks.

 During Phase 2 (a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks in duration), patients were assessed bi-weekly and stabilized on an oral dose of aripiprazole ranging from 10 mg to 30 mg daily.

 After stability criteria were met in Phase 2, patients entered the single-blind aripiprazole intramuscular (IM) depot stabilization phase, Phase 3.

 In Phase 3, patients were stabilized on aripiprazole IM depot for 12 consecutive weeks.

 Once the patient met the stability criteria, they were eligible to be randomized into the double-blind phase, Phase 4.

 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (aripiprazole IM depot vs placebo IM depot) stratified by region and last aripiprazole IM depot injection dose level in Phase 3.

 During Phase 4, patients were assessed for impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms.

 If a patient was identified with impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, they were withdrawn from the trial and given the opportunity to enroll into an open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial, 31-08-248.

 Patients that completed Phase 4 (up to and including Week 52) had the option to enroll into an open-label aripiprazole IM depot trial, 31-08-248 (NCT00731549).

 Intramuscular Depot Formulation of Aripiprazole as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Schizophrenia@highlight

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an intramuscular depot formulation of aripiprazole as maintenance treatment in patients with schizophrenia.

 The trial was designed into 4 treatment phases.

 Phase 1 was designed to allow for a patient to be converted from their current antipsychotic treatment to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy (oral conversion phase from 4 to 6 weeks).

 During Phase 2, the patient was stabilized on oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy (oral stabilization phase from a minimum of 4 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks).

 Once the patient was stabilized in Phase 2, they entered Phase 3, the single-blind intramuscular (IM) depot aripiprazole stabilization phase.

 The goal of the phase was to stabilize the patient on the IM depot aripiprazole formulation for a minimum of 12 weeks to a maximum of 36 weeks.

 When the patient was stabilized, they were eligible to be randomized into the double-blind IM depot maintenance phase (Phase 4).

 During Phase 4, the patient was assessed for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and/or impending relapse for up to 52 weeks.
