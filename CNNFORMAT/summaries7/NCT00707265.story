(firstQuint)rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON Spinal System Pivotal Study.

 This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON(R) Spinal System for posterolateral fusion treatment of patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease versus the control group of autogenous bone with the CD HORIZON(R) Spinal System.

 The investigational treatment was the open bilateral posterolateral implantation of the rhBMP-2/CRM/CD HORIZON(R) Spinal System.

 One investigational implant was placed across two adjacent transverse processes on each side of the spine during the spinal fusion procedure.

 The control treatment was the bilateral posterolateral implantation of the autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest with the CD HORIZON(R) Spinal System.
