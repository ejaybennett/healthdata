(thirdQuint)Study Evaluating Inhaled AeroLEF (Liposome-Encapsulated Fentanyl)in Normal Healthy Subjects.

 In Period I, subjects received an intravenous dose of fentanyl (200 mu g) administered over 1 minute (Treatment A).

 Subjects then crossed over to Period II.

 In Period II, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mL (1000 mu g fentanyl; Treatment B) or 3mL (1500 mu g fentanyl; Treatment C) of AeroLEF delivered by nebulization with the AeroEclipse BAN.

 Subjects were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for approximately 1 minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all aerosolized medication was delivered.

 There was at least a 1 week washout period between study periods.
