(secondQuint)Pharmacokinetics of Low Molecular Weight and Unfractionated Heparin in Pregnancy.

 This study's specific objectives include: 1.

 Evaluating pharmacokinetic (concentration-time) and pharmacodynamic (concentration- effect) parameters for dalteparin and UFH prior to pregnancy, during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters and postpartum, using revised dosing protocols based on previous study.

 2.

 Determining therapeutic response to the heparins, i.

e.

 live birth rate and lack of maternal or fetal complications, in relation to drug exposure, based on AUC.

 3.

 Documenting maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy for dalteparin and UFH, using the revised dosing protocols.

 Pharmacokinetics of Low Molecular Weight and Unfractionated Heparin in Pregnancy@highlight

To determine, through pharmacokinetic parameters, the ideal dosing protocol for dalteparin (a low molecular weight heparin) and unfractionated heparin for women desiring pregnancy who have evidence of an acquired (specifically, antiphospholipid syndrome) or inherited thrombophilia.
