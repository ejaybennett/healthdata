(thirdQuint)Molecular Biology of Polycythemia and Thrombocytosis.

 Our hypothesis is that genes and their mutation are causative of certain types of polycythemia and thrombocytosis.

 These will be sought for by genetic and cell biology means.

 The purpose of the study is to identify the molecular defect of these disorders.

 5-7 teaspoons of peripheral blood will be drawn on all study subjects.

 After DNA is obtained, linkage analysis and/or mutation analysis will be performed.

 Molecular Biology of Polycythemia and Thrombocytosis@highlight

Our study is designed to characterize the clinical picture and genetic pattern of Polycythemia and Thrombocytosis.

 The purpose of this project is to find a gene and its mutation that causes these disorders.

 When this is accomplished, new therapies to control and eventually cure the disorder can be designed.
