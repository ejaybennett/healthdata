(fifthQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of 3 Fixed Doses of JNJ-37822681 in Participants With Schizophrenia.

 This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), double-blind (neither the participant nor the physician know the study medication drug name), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group (a clinical trial comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments), dose-response study in participants with schizophrenia.

 The total study duration will not exceed 16 weeks for each participant and will include following visits: screening, baseline, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13 (end of treatment or early withdrawal), and a post-study safety visit (1 week after final dose of study drug).

 All participants will be hospitalized during the first 2 weeks of treatment for detailed follow-up of safety and disease status.

 Following a screening period, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups to receive oral doses of JNJ-37822681 (10, 20 or 30 milligram [mg] twice a day) for 12 weeks, olanzapine 15 mg daily for 12 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks followed by olanzapine 15 mg daily for the remaining 6 weeks.

 Olanzapine will be initiated at 10 mg daily for 1 week and then increased to 15 mg daily for the remainder of the treatment period.

 Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

 Participants' safety will also be monitored at each visit.

 An Efficacy and Safety Study of 3 Fixed Doses of JNJ-37822681 in Participants With Schizophrenia@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 fixed doses of JNJ-37822681 compared with placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) after 6 weeks treatment and olanzapine after 12 weeks treatment in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).
