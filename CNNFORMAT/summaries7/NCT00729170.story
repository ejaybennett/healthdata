(secondQuint)Milk Supplementation and Energy Balance.

.

 Calcium deficiency is related to a higher risk of obesity.

 Some studies showed a lost of weight by elevating the calcium consumption to reach the recommended level.

 Milk supplementation could be a good alternative to reach this objective, but its impact on weight loss and on appetite sensations has not been verified.

 Considering the benefits of milk on bone health, a higher intake of this food product during weight loss could represent a healthy strategy.
