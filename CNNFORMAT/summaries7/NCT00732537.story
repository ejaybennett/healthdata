(thirdQuint)Inhaled Nitric Oxide by Oxygen Hood in Neonates.

 Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is currently used in the management of ventilated neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

 We have shown that iNO administered by oxygen hood reduces pulmonary vascular resistance in hypoxia- and group B streptococcus-induced pulmonary hypertension in an animal model (J Perinatol 2002; 22:50-6).

 Our objective was to determine the feasibility of iNO administration by oxygen hood in neonates with respiratory failure.

 Methods: A masked randomized controlled trial was performed on eight infants with respiratory failure.

 Inclusion criteria were: gestation>34 weeks, age100 mm Hg, while oxygenation was unchanged in the controls.

 Methemoglobinemia and other adverse effects were not noted in any infant.

 Environmental levels of NO and NO2 were minimal (0.

3m from the hood.

 Conclusions: Administration of iNO by oxygen hood is feasible.

 Larger randomized controlled trials are required to measure the efficacy and determine an appropriate target population for this technique.

 Inhaled Nitric Oxide by Oxygen Hood in Neonates@highlight

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) improves oxygenation in term infants with respiratory failure.

 However, iNO has been primarily used in infants receiving mechanical ventilation.

 This study is a pilot study to determine if iNO given into an oxygen hood is effective in improving oxygenation in term and near-term infants who have poor oxygenation but who are not yet mechanically ventilated.
