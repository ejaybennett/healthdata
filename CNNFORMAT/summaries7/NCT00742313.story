(secondQuint)Effect on Bleeding When Using FloSeal Matrix in Subjects Undergoing Endoscopic Vein Harvest (EVH).

 Purpose of Study: The primary objective of this study is to determine if using a hemostatic agent (FloSeal Matrix cent ) in the tunnel of the endoscopically harvested Greater Saphenous vein will decrease bleeding from that site.

 Secondary objectives are to determine if there is a decrease in the infection-rate at the site of the vein-harvested leg where the FloSeal Matrix cent was used compared to the ones where FloSeal Matrix cent was not used.

 Background and Significance: FloSeal Matrix cent is indicated in surgical procedures (other than ophthalmic) as an adjunct to hemostasis when control of bleeding by ligature or conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical.

 It works on wet, actively bleeding tissue and conforms to irregular wound surfaces.

 It is proven to control bleeding from oozing to pulsatile flow.

 The EVH wound bed is irregular and hemostasis is, at times, difficult to obtain using conventional procedures such as ligature or cautery.

 Design and Procedures: This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial that compares the effects of applying FloSeal Matrix cent to the EVH wound bed to not applying FloSeal Matrix cent to the EVH wound bed.

This is a prospective, randomized trial to see in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and endoscopically-harvested greater saphenous vein, if using FloSeal Matrix in the endoscopically-harvested saphenous vein wound bed decreases bleeding and complications.
