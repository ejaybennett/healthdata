(thirdQuint)Hypnosis for Smoking Relapse Prevention.

 We will enroll 520 current smokers in the study.

 All subjects will participate in an initial smoking cessation intervention involving brief counseling and nicotine replacement therapy.

 Participants who are able to achieve at least 3 consecutive days of abstinence will be randomized to one of two relapse prevention interventions.

 The participants in Study Arm 1 will receive a hypnosis intervention designed to facilitate relapse prevention.

 Participants in Study Arm 2 will participate in empirically-supported behavior relapse prevention counseling, utilizing the National Cancer Institute's Forever Free materials.

 Both interventions will be conducted in two 60-minute individual sessions scheduled one week apart in addition to counseling phone calls on their quit date and after relapse prevention treatment.

 Outcomes for the two study arms will be compared by assessing biochemically-validated point-prevalence smoking status at 9 weeks(end of treatment), 26 weeks and 52 weeks.

 Hypnosis for relapse prevention is designed to sustain the ex-smokers commitment to remain abstinent, to provide a review of behavioral skills to resist the temptations to smoke, and to encourage attempts to quit again if relapse occurs.

 Hypnosis for Smoking Relapse Prevention@highlight

A majority of smokers who quit return to smoking within three months of their quit date.

 This study is a randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of hypnosis versus behavioural counseling to promote maintenance of abstinence or relapse prevention in quitting smokers.

 The hypothesis is that hypnosis will be at least as effective as behavioral counseling in preventing relapse to smoking in smokers who are able to quit for at least three days.
