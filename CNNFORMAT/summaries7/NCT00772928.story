(fifthQuint)Study of the Effect of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) on Immunogenicity of Pentacel.

 This is a 2-staged study.

 Stage I of this study is designed to compare the immune responses elicited by an infant series (3 doses) of Pentacel cent when given at different times from or concurrently with Prevnar(R).

 Stage II is designed to describe the immune responses elicited by a 4th dose of Pentacel cent (all antigens) when given at different times from or concurrently with Prevnar(R).
