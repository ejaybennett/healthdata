(secondQuint)Optimisation of Monitoring for Clinical Research Studies.

 There is no validated standard of monitoring strategy for clinical research studies.

 Optimon will compare two monitoring strategies - a classical strategy based on the practices of the pharmaceutical industry, and an optimized strategy based on patient's risk level - on their ability to produce exact data, focusing on the main quality criteria: regulatory requirements and scientific validity of results.

 Optimon is a non inferiority randomized trial.

 Optimisation of Monitoring for Clinical Research Studies@highlight

OPTIMON will compare the efficacy and the cost of two monitoring strategies: one based on the classic standards of quality assurance, and the other one being a priori "optimized" on the main scientific and regulatory principles.
