(secondQuint)The PostprAndial eNdothelial Function After Combination of Ezetimibe and simvAstatin Study.

 Metabolic syndrome is defined as a group of cardiovascular risk factors and is mainly driven by the epidemic of obesity.

 High blood lipid levels after a meal may be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 In this study we will investigate whether simvastatin in combination with ezetimibe vs.

 simvastatin alone, has a beneficial effect on the lipid levels after a meal, but more importantly, whether we can measure a difference in function of the endothelium.

 In a small pilot study we already found that the combination had a beneficial effect in comparison with simvastatin alone.

 Now we want to solidify these findings in a larger study.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose simvastatin in combination with ezetimibe in comparison to high-dose simvastatin alone, has a beneficial effect on the function of the endothelium after an oral fat load in patients with metabolic syndrome.
