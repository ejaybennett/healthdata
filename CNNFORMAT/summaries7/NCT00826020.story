(secondQuint)Evaluation of Omegaven Parenteral Nutrition in Patients With TPN-Induced Cholestasis.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the need for and time to small bowel transplantation or liver transplantation.

 This will be calculated as both the age at time of primary transplant as well as the length of time from initial evaluation to transplant.

Secondary objectives are to determine if there are improvements in clinical measures associated with established parenteral nutrition- associated liver disease (PNALD).

 These will be determined by measurement of total and direct bilirubin levels, platelet count, serum albumin, and changes in both length and weight growth curves.

The purpose of this study is to determine if established parenteral nutrition (PN) associated liver disease can be reversed or its progression halted by using a parenteral fat emulsion prepared from fish oil as measured by normalization of serum levels of hepatic enzymes and bilirubin.
