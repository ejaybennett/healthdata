(thirdQuint)CRAFT Behavior Therapy: Treatment Entry Component.

 The consequences of drug abuse are not limited to drug users; they also extend to their families and concerned significant others (CSOs).

 Research shows that CSOs of drug users have increased prevalence of illness, domestic violence, and problems in mood and functioning.

 Because CSOs are troubled by the negative effects of drug use on the drug user and themselves, they may be a social community that is particularly invested in learning ways to positively influence the drug user.

 We compare the benefits of the original treatment, Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), with the Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) component of CRAFT to see if the TEnt is sufficient to produce the primary and most consistent outcome of CRAFT -- treatment entry of the drug user.

 CRAFT Behavior Therapy: Treatment Entry Component@highlight

This research compares the benefits of the original treatment, Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), with the Treatment Entry Training (TEnT) component of CRAFT to determine if TEnt alone can produce the primary outcome of CRAFT -- treatment entry of the drug user.

 We also look at the impact on the well-being of the concerned significant other and the drug use of their loved one.
