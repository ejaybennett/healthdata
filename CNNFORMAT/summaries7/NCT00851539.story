(secondQuint)Evaluating Post-test HIV Counseling Videos for Teens.

 Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of their engagement in high risk sexual activity.

 This study seeks to determine effective ways to educate teens about HIV and how to protect themselves by use of multimedia.

 All eligible participants who agree to enroll in this trial will be randomized into two arms: the behavioral intervention video (intervention group) or meeting with an in-person counselor (control group) as they wait for their rapid HIV results.

 The goals of the RCT involve establishing the feasibility of using touch-screen technology for teenagers in the ED; establishing the receptivity of teens to HIV rapid testing in the ED; providing data on rates, and obtaining preliminary data on the effectiveness of the video in changing condom efficacy, condom outcome expectancies and condom use intention.

 Consenting to rapid HIV testing is a secondary outcome.
