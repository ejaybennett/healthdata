(firstQuint)Plating Clavicle Fractures.

 Compare the rates of soft-tissue irritation with two different methods of plating for clavicle fractures.

 Patients will be randomized to anterior-inferior or superior plating.

 Validated shoulder scoring systems will be used to assess outcome.

 Specific follow-up questions will address the patient's ability to wear his/her uniform, body armor, ruck sack, and other shoulder-borne equipment over the surgical site.
