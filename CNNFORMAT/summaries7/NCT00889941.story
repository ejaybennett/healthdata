(firstQuint)Effect of Preoperative Pupil Size on Quality of Vision After Wavefront-Guided LASIK.

 Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the effect of preoperative pupil size on quality of vision after wavefront-guided LASIK.

 Methods: Fifty-one patients underwent LASIK for low myopia and completed questionnaires regarding specific visual symptoms before and after surgery.

 Each eye was evaluated postoperatively at 1-week, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months.

 Pupils were stratified according to size: small (6.

0mm).

 Mesopic pupil size and preoperative and postoperative variables were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA).

 A regression model was also performed to determine the correlation between mean spherical equivalent and cylinder and visual symptoms.
