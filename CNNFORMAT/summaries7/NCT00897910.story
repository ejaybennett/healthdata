(thirdQuint)Studying T Cells in Blood and Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the feasibility of expanding myeloma-specific T cells using autologous ex vivo expanded B cells loaded with myeloma antigens as antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma.

 Secondary - To examine the feasibility of selecting and expanding myeloma-specific T cells ex vivo using interferon release and CD3/CD28 stimulation.

 OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies.

 Samples are analyzed to assess the feasibility of expanding autologous B cells ex vivo using CD40L and IL-4; the antigen-presenting phenotype of autologous B-cell antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) using flow cytometry; and the antigen-presenting function of B-APCs using ELISPOT and chromium-release assay.

 Myeloma-specific interferon secreting T cells are isolated and selected using Miltenyi beads.

 The selected myeloma-specific T cells are expanded ex vivo using anti CD3/CD28 beads.
