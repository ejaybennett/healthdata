(thirdQuint)Cancer Genome Study Using Samples From Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated on Clinical Trial ACOSOG-Z0030.

 OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens from patients with stage I or II, N0 or N1 (less than hilar) non-small cell lung cancer.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical sites and analyzed by transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation.

 Clinical information associated with each specimen donor is also collected.

RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the cancer genome using tumor samples from patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer treated on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z0030.
