(thirdQuint)Prostaglandin Metabolite in Urine Samples From Patients With Ovarian Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the level of prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M) in 24-hour urine samples collected prior to surgery or chemotherapy from patients with ovarian cancer.

 - Determine cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression by western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian tumor tissue samples and matched normal ovarian tissue samples, if available, from these patients.

 - Correlate urine PGE-M levels with corresponding tissue COX-1 and COX-2 levels in urine and tissue samples from these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients submit 24-hour urine specimens prior to surgery for evaluation of urinary levels of prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M).

 Patients also undergo assessment of tissue obtained at the time of surgery, including ovarian tumor tissue, normal surface ovarian epithelium tissue (if available), and fixed tissue embedded in a paraffin block.

 Tissue samples are analyzed by western blot and IHC for cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression.

 Prostaglandin Metabolite in Urine Samples From Patients With Ovarian Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Measuring the amount of prostaglandin metabolite in urine samples and studying tissue samples in the laboratory from patients with ovarian cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to ovarian cancer and may help the study of cancer in the future.

 PURPOSE: This laboratory study is measuring the amount of prostaglandin metabolite in urine samples from patients with ovarian cancer.
