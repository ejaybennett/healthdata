(firstQuint)Topic Ketorolac Added to Panphotocoagulation in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.

 Panphotocoagulation is the standard treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy during 3 to 4 sessions within 2 weeks.

 This treatment reduces the incidence of severe visual loss in the long term.

 Nonetheless, it induces macular thickness that delays the conclusion of the treatment.

 This delay could coincide with vitreous hemorrhage which, in turn, may limit additional photocoagulation.

 Topic ketorolac could limit the inflammatory reaction cause by panphotocoagulation and produce early benefits in the patient.
