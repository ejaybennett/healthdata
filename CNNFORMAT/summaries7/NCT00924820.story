(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Bevacizumab for Neoplastic Meningitis.

 The Study Drug: Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the growth of blood vessels.

 Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, every 2 weeks, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over about 1 hour.

 Study Visits: At Weeks 2 and 4: - Samples of CSF from your spinal cord will be collected to check for the presence of cancer cells.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.

 - If you already have an Ommaya reservoir tap in place, samples of CSF from your brain will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects.

 - You will have a neurological exam.

 At Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, and then every 8 weeks: - Samples of CSF from your spinal cord will be collected to check for the presence of cancer cells.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.

 - If you already have an Ommaya reservoir tap in place, samples of CSF from your brain will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 - You will have a physical exam (Weeks .

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects.

 - You will have a neurological exam.

 - You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

 - You will have an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

 - Urine will be collected to test kidney function and for routine tests.

 If indicated urine will be collected over a 24 hour period.

 Every 2 weeks, your blood pressure will be measured.

 Length of Study: You will be on study for up to 54 weeks (about 1 year).

 You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.

 End-of-Study Visit: If you go off study early, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - You will have a neurological exam.

 - Samples of CSF from your spinal cord will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.

 You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

 - If you already have an Ommaya reservoir tap in place, samples of CSF from your brain will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 Follow-up Visits: If you do not go off study early, within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug, every 4 weeks for 3 months, and then every 3 months from then on, you will have follow-up visits.

 The following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Your performance status will be recorded.

 - You will have a neurological exam.

 - Samples of CSF from your spinal will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood's ability to clot normally.

 You will have an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

 -If you already have an Ommaya reservoir tap in place, samples of CSF from your brain will be collected to look for the presence of cancer cells.

 This is an investigational study.

 Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of colon, breast, and lung cancer.

 Its use for the treatment of cancer that has spread to the meninges of the brain or the spinal cord is investigational.

 Up to 25 patients will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

 A Pilot Study of Bevacizumab for Neoplastic Meningitis@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if and how Avastin (bevacizumab) may affect cancer that has spread to the meninges of the brain or the spinal cord.

 The safety of this drug will also be studied.
