(firstQuint)Clinical Evaluation of AutoFlow Mode During Mechanical Ventilation.

 Many new mechanical ventilation modes are proposed without clinical evaluation.

 Among them, "dual-controlled" modes, as AutoFlow, are supposed to improve patient-ventilator interfacing, and could led to lesser alarm.

 This study is a long term clinical evaluation of AutoFlow during assist-controlled ventilation, focusing on its efficacy (on gas exchange and outcome) and on ventilator alarms.
