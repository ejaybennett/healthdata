(thirdQuint)Safety and Performance Study of the CAdiscTM-L Lumbar Spinal Disc Replacement Device For CE Marking.

 Study Design: International, multicenter, open, clinical investigation with comparison to pre-operative Currently there are two surgical procedures for the treatment of chronic low back pain: Spinal fusion and Total Disc Replacement.

 CAdisc cent -L(Compliant Artificial disc - Lumbar) is a Lumbar total disc replacement product that preserves motion and restores disc height and stability Surgical access is via a routine anterior approach with discectomy (removal of the diseased disc), which is performed prior to implantation of the CAdisc cent -L.

 Instruments are then used to prepare the disc space and to controllably place the replacement disc at the target point.

 It is not intended for the surgery to differ in type, duration or risk to any other device of this nature.
