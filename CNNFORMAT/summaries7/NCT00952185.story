(secondQuint)Influenza Vaccine in Preventing Flu in Patients Who Have Undergone Stem Cell Transplant and in Healthy Volunteers.

 OBJECTIVES: - To examine the incidence rate of influenza infection over two flu seasons in patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the City of Hope National Medical Center.

 - To correlate influenza infection with graft-vs-host disease, age, and transplant type in these patients.

 - To examine and compare the incidence rate of influenza in healthy volunteers to the incidence rate in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Beginning approximately 2 weeks after vaccination or the onset of flu season, patients and healthy participants undergo nasopharyngeal washes every 14-17 days (2-10 washes) during the months of November-March of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 flu seasons.

 Samples are analyzed by direct fluorescent antibodies.

 Patients and participants complete case report forms detailing flu-like symptoms experienced in the 2 weeks before sample collection.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients and 75 healthy volunteers will be accrued for this study.
