(firstQuint)Device to Reduce Surgery Site Contamination.

 The Air Barrier System is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery site from ambient airborne contamination.

 This study examines the hypothesis that the Air Barrier System can reduce the presence of airborne colony-forming units (e.

g.

 bacteria colonies) and particulate at the surgery site.
