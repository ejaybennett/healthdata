(fifthQuint)A Study of Gadodiamide Injection in Myocardial Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

 This study is a multicentre, open label, phase III study in adult subjects designed to show that Gd-DTPA-BMA (a conventional MR contrast medium = OMNISCAN) enhanced myocardial MR perfusion imaging is non-inferior to myocardial SPECT.

 Both imaging techniques will be performed during adenosine stress (0.

14mg/min/kg over 3 minutes IV).

 Gd-DTPA-BMA will be used twice (2 doses of 0.

075 mmol/kg for the stress and rest study each) for the detection of myocardial perfusion defects.

 The standard of reference is invasive coronary angiography, which defines the presence of coronary artery disease, if vessels of at least 2mm in diameter show stenosis of at least 50% (diameter reduction).

 Patients with a history of myocardial infarction(s) are positive for coronary artery disease, even when coronary arteries are not stenosed as evidenced by the coronary angiography performed in the setting of this trial(= assigning patients as positive for coronary artery disease after successful PCI-revascularization of acute infarct(s) in the past).

 A Study of Gadodiamide Injection in Myocardial Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine how well perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is able to detect certain heart abnormalities, such as a coronary artery narrowing.

 To this purpose, a conventional MR contrast medium (Gd-DTPA-BMA) will be used during an adenosine infusion (an approved substance which enlarges the arteries of the heart, so that the blood flow to the heart muscle increases).

 This magnetic resonance imaging technique will be compared with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a well-established technique to detect this heart abnormalities.

 Both, cardiac MR and SPECT will be compared with invasive coronary angiography, a technique which directly visualized the heart vessels and narrowings of these (=standard of reference).
