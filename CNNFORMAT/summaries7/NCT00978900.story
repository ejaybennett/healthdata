(secondQuint)Effects of Artificial Sweetener on Gastrointestinal (GI) Peptide Secretion.

 Artificial Sweeteners significantly lower energy density of foods and beverages.

 They are used by diabetics as sugar substitutes as well as by consumers as aids for dietary control.

 Despite numerous studies which show mainly no influence of artificial sweeteners on glucose metabolism and food intake, discrepancies consist about the real effects of artificial sweeteners.

 Studies by Blundell and Hill in 1986 have however shown that the consumption of artificial sweeteners resulted in an increase of appetite ratings; the efficiency of AS has therefore been questioned.

 With respect to the world wide increase in the prevalence in obesity, it seems important to clarify whether artificial sweeteners can help regulate body weight or not.

 This study will explore the effect of artificial sweeteners on the release of the gastrointestinal satiety hormones PYY, GLP-1, GIP and ghrelin.

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame K, sucralose) and carbohydrate sugars (glucose, fructose) on the release of gastrointestinal satiety hormones in humans.
