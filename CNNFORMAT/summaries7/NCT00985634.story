(thirdQuint)Clinical Evaluation of LeGoo Internal Vessel Occluder Versus Traditional Vessel Loops.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of LeGoo cent as compared to a traditional vessel loop.

 LeGoo is a device that is intended to be used during surgical procedures to temporarily occlude blood vessels while forming an anastomosis.

 LeGoo cent will be evaluated in subjects undergoing off-pump coronary artery by-pass (OPCAB) surgery.

 This is a prospective, randomized trial with a 30-day follow-up period.

 Half of the eligible patients will be randomized to the experimental group (LeGoo cent ); and the other half to the control group (standard vessel loops).

 LeGoo cent is polymer-based device which is comprised of a non-toxic and biocompatible gel that exists as a liquid at low temperatures and rapidly transitions to a solid at body temperature, forming a plug that can occlude blood vessels.

 LeGoo cent is injected into a blood vessel that is intended to be occluded, where it stays in a "plug" form for several minutes allowing the surgeon to work in a bloodless field.

 The gel dissolves with time (spontaneously) or can be reversed back to liquid instantly by cooling the site with ice or irrigating with cold saline.

 Once dissolved below a minimum concentration, the polymer can never re-solidify.

 The primary research hypothesis is that surgeons will obtain a bloodless surgical field and achieve satisfactory hemostasis in a larger proportion of anastomoses using LeGoo cent than using a conventional temporary hemostasis technique.

 Satisfactory hemostasis is defined by the surgeon who will quantitate his/her observation about the quality of the surgical field using the following scoring system: 1.

 - Excellent hemostasis (no bleeding) 2.

 - Minimal bleeding (bleeding does not interfere with suturing) 3.

 - Modest bleeding (required intermittent use of another device to control bleeding at the site of the anastomosis) 4.

 - Copious bleeding (required continuous use of another device) "Excellent hemostasis" and "minimal bleeding" are considered "satisfactory hemostasis.

" Satisfactory hemostasis will constitute a treatment success for the purpose of evaluating the primary efficacy of LeGoo.

 The primary endpoint is the proportion of anastomoses in which satisfactory hemostasis is achieved.

 Clinical Evaluation of LeGoo Internal Vessel Occluder Versus Traditional Vessel Loops@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clinical safety and efficacy of LeGoo cent in comparison to a standard vessel occlusion method (i.

e.

 vessel loops).

 Although LeGoo cent is suitable for use in any vascular surgery where temporary vessel occlusion is desired, this study specifically focuses on the use of LeGoo cent in off-pump coronary bypass (OPCAB), as a most sensitive model of adverse changes that may occur at any vascular site.
