(firstQuint)Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of CCX 354-C in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis.

 This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study will consist of two sequential stages, Stage A and B.

 This protocol describes the objectives, design, and procedures for Stage A of the study.

 The protocol will be amended in future when sufficient data from Stage A have been collected to initiate Stage B.

 The protocol amendment will describe the objectives, design, and procedures for Stage B of the study.

 Stage A will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, sequential dose escalation sub-study in 24 subjects with stable RA.

 Three sequential dose cohorts of 8 subjects will be included in this stage: - Cohort 1: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo - Cohort 2: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo - Cohort 3: 200 mg CCX354-C or placebo Safety and PK data from each cohort will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee (DMC)before dose escalation to the next dose level.

 The study will proceed to Stage B only if the safety and tolerability profile of Stage A is deemed acceptable by the DMC.
