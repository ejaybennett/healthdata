(secondQuint)Safety Study of Peptide Cancer Vaccine To Treat HLA-A*24-positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A*2402-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer.

 In this phase I trial, the investigators examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced non-small cell lung cancers.
