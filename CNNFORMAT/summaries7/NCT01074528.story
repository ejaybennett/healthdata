(thirdQuint)Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction: Supportive Treatment for Adult Patients With Cancer and Their Partners.

 Patients with breast cancer often experience anxiety, depression, stress and reduced quality of life.

 As such, there is an increased interest in the implementation of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program as an additional supportive treatment.

 MBSR is a structured group program that aims at reducing stress levels by enhancing awareness of the present moment in combination with a non-judgemental attitude.

 The study evaluates the effects of an 8-week MBSR program on quality of life, mood, depression, stress and coping skills in breast cancer patients.

 Breast cancer patients of the Breast Clinic of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel participate in the MBSR program.

 Before and after the training program patients filled out questionnaires evaluating quality of life, coping skills, emotional functioning, stress and aspects of mindfulness.
