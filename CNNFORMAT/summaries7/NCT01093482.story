(fifthQuint)Third International Study on Mechanical Ventilation.

 Mechanical ventilation is commonly used in patients admitted to intensive care units.

 Clinical studies have investigated some of the aspects associated with its utilization, and have contributed to improve the knowledge and management of patients with acute respiratory failure.

 In 1998 the invesgtigators conducted the first international study on mechanical ventilation, including 5183 patients who were mechanically ventilated longer than 12 hours (Esteban A.

 JAMA 2002).

 Six years later, the investigators carried out the second international study on mechanical ventilation including 4968 patients.

 These studies allowed us to analyze the evolution of mechanical ventilation and to judge the concordance of practice with results of randomized trials (Esteban A.

 Am J Respir Crit Care 2008).

 The main finding of this study was the high degree of concordance between observed changes in mechanical ventilation practice and changes predicted from reports of randomized controlled trials.

 However, despite apparently beneficial changes in ventilatory practice, the investigators were not able to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes over this time period.

 Our results serve as an updated benchmark on the usual care and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients in a 'real-world' setting.

 The investigators now propose to conduct a third international study of mechanical ventilation, 6 years after the 2nd study and 12 years after the original.

 This will again be a prospective, multicenter single-cohort study, which will enroll consecutive patients who have received mechanical ventilation for at least 12 hours during a 1-month period, and will follow each patient for the duration of mechanical ventilation, up to 28 days.

 With this 3rd study the investigators aim: 1) to determine if the observed changes that the investigators reported previously are maintained over time; 2) to evaluate if the changes implemented have impacted outcomes; 3) to analyze some aspects related to withdrawal of mechanical ventilation; and implementation non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; and 4) to evaluate what differences may occur between geographical areas.

 Third International Study on Mechanical Ventilation@highlight

The objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the spectrum of use of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units: 1.

 Main analysis: To know the all-cause mortality rate in mechanically ventilated patients 2.

 Secondary analyses: - To know the current status of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and determine the number and percentage of patients who are admitted to an intensive care unit and require mechanical ventilation.

 - To compare the results with prior data collected in previous observational studies (1998 and 2004) - Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation - Weaning - Use of adjuvant therapies as steroids or selective digestive decontamination - Sedation including prevalence of delirium in mechanically ventilated patients - Prediction of the duration of mechanical ventilation - Other
