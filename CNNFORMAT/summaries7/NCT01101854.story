(thirdQuint)Gene Expression Profiles in Healing and Non-Healing Wounds.

 This study has two arms: 1) the biopsy arm and 2) the debridement arm.

 The purpose of the biopsy arm is to determine whether there are similar patterns of genes being turned on and/or turned off among people with healing and non-healing wounds.

 The purpose of the debridement arm is to (i) identify the nature of bacterial infection and the genes driving the tissue response to it; and (ii) determine how the biofilm components arrest/paralyze the immune function.

 For the biopsy arm, a single subject (current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient) will provide 2 tissue samples (3 mm punch biopsy samples collected by a wound care physician) from a single wound over a 4-week time period.

 The wound and the samples will be categorized as healing versus non-healing responses on the basis of decreased (healing) or increased (non-healing) wound area measurements over the 4-week time period.

 A chronic wound generally is a wound which shows no signs of significant healing in four weeks or has not healed in eight weeks.

 The ability to obtain additional measurements from patients' medical records up to 12 weeks after enrollment in the study will confirm the healing or non-healing trajectory of the wound.

 For the debridement arm, a single subject (current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient) will be seen 1 time at the CWC during their regularly scheduled wound care visits or during your scheduled surgery and debrided tissue (foreign matter and dead tissue from a wound) that is ordinarily discarded will be collected.

 No additional wound care visits will be required as all study-related visits will happen during regularly scheduled appointments at an OSU Comprehensive Wound Center or in the operating room (OR) (if a patient's physician determines that surgical debridement is required).

 The ability to obtain additional measurements from patients' medical records up to 12 weeks after enrollment in the study will confirm the healing or non-healing trajectory of the wound.

 Debrided tissue that is collected will be divided into three parts: A) Necrotic/slough tissue (N); B) Live tissue determined by consistency and pinkish color, but not perfused (LNP); or C) Red perfused tissue (LP).

 If it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the LNP and LP, the two groups will be combined together.

 In an effort to identify the infection markers of normal or impaired healing, we plan to create a database that contains pathogen type, gene and protein expression profiles and enzymatic activity from infected human wound specimens.
