(secondQuint)A Study Comparing Viscosupplementation and Corticosteroid Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis.

 OBJECTIVES Primary i.

 To determine if patients' VAS "pain while walking" is different at 6 weeks post-injection in patients who receive a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) versus patients who receive a single injection of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc One cent ) for treatment of knee OA.

 Secondary i.

 To determine if differences in VAS "pain while walking" scores exist at 1 and 3 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 ii.

 To determine if differences in VAS "pain at rest" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 iii.

 To determine if differences in VAS "pain with stairs" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 iii.

 To determine if differences in KOOS questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 iv.

 To determine if differences in WOMAC questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 v.

 To determine if differences in adverse events exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients.

 vi.

 To track the number of patients who receive additional injections after 3 months following their index injection.

 A Study Comparing Viscosupplementation and Corticosteroid Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis@highlight

Do differences exist between patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of corticosteroid versus patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection?
