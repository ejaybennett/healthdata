(fifthQuint)Pharmacogenomic of Atazanavir/Efavirenz (ATV/EFV).

 The overall goal of this study is to characterize role of pharmacogenomic on ARV drug (atazanavir, and efavirenz) levels, its toxicities, and its long term efficacy among HIV-infected adults in Thailand.

 The specific aims are (1) to evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphism on ARV drug levels (2) to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism/ drug levels on long term immunologic and virologic response (3) to correlate the genetic polymorphism/drug levels on antiretroviral toxicities.

 The proposed study will be analysed in stored samples of the well-established cohort of long-term follow-up study for HIV-infected patients participated in HIV-NAT study protocols, the HIV-NAT006 study.

 This cohort provide us unique opportunity to study impact of pharmacogenomics on long term treatment response and long term drug toxicities since this cohort was started in 1996.

 Furthermore, the important factors include ARV regimen, drug toxicities, PBMC, immunological and virological parameters have been collected every 6 months basis in HIV-NAT006 study.

 A comprehensive understanding of the impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV infection and HIV medication will lead to development of appropriate intervention, particularly, dose reduction strategy in patient with particular gene correlated with greater drug levels.

 The dose reduction strategy will decrease long term drug toxicity and cost saving for Thai and Asian Ethnicity.

Objectives: - To evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphism on ARV drug levels - To evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism/drug levels on long term immunologic and virologic response - To correlate the genetic polymorphism/drug levels on antiretroviral toxicities The long-term objective of this research plan is to characterize impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV drug concentration, toxicities, and response to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected adults.

 A comprehensive understanding of the impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV infection and HIV medication will lead to the development of appropriate intervention such as dose reduction strategies in patients with particular gene(s) correlated with higher drug levels.

 The dose reduction strategy will decrease long term drug toxicity and cost saving for Thais and Asian Ethnicities.
