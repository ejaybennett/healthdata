 All-cause mortality was followed up after median 3.

5 years s in a cohort study of 1767 participants.

 Cause-specific mortality was followed up after median 4.

 Nutritional Status Among Older Adults.

 Risk Factors and Consequences of Malnutrition@highlight

The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition among older adults admitted to hospital and to analyse predictive factors for malnutrition.

 Further, the aim was to analyse the association between nutritional status and all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

 The hypothesis is that malnourished patients have a higher mortality then well-nourished patients after three years.
