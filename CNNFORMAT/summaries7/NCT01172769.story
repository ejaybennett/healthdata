(firstQuint)Efficacy Study of Temsirolimus to Treat Head and Neck Cancer.

 Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression.

 It was approved in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

 Temsirolimus demonstrated also antitumor activity in a variety of other human cancer models, such as gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, neuroblastomas, prostata and breast cancer through induction of apoptosis or inhibition of proliferation.

 A similar effect was noted in HNSCC cell lines.

 This is the first study evaluating the efficacy and safety of temsirolimus in platinum/cetuximab-refractory HNSCC.
