(thirdQuint)Phase 1, Dose-escalation Trial of OPB-51602 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 In expansion stage part 1, up to 20 advanced sold tumor subjects will be investigated the safety profiled and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose for 3 weeks per cycle(2 weeks treatment and 1 week washout).

 In the expansion stage part 2, a maximum of 20 subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Melanoma or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) will be treated until an investigational Medicinal product (IMP) efficacious case can be found.
