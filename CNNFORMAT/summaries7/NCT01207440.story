(thirdQuint)Ponatinib for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Evaluation and Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

 The preliminary analysis of the phase 1 clinical trial revealed evidence of clinical antitumor activity in patients with resistance to approved second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), dasatinib and nilotinib, including patients with the T315I mutation of the BCR-ABL gene (BCR-ABL).

 This Phase 1 study, taken together with the strong preclinical data that characterize ponatinib, provides the rationale for moving to a pivotal phase 2 trial of this agent in a population of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy and in those patients with the T315I mutation.

 PACE is a multi-center, international, phase 2, uncontrolled, open-label trial of oral ponatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) disease.

 Ponatinib for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Evaluation and Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) or with Ph positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who either are resistant or intolerant to either dasatinib or nilotinib, or have the T315I mutation.
