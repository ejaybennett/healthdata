 This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease risk, including whole body adiposity with DEXA, HTGC and CIMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk.

 The primary goals of this study are to deliver an evidence-based weight loss intervention to the population of youth who are overweight or obese as a result of antipsychotic treatment, to characterize metabolic risk associated with weight using sensitive biomarkers, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these biomarkers in children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention.

 This study will completed in two phases.

 Study Phase 1, Aim 1: To test the feasibility of delivering an existing family-based behavioral weight loss program in families of psychiatrically ill youth who are overweight or obese.

 Study Phase 2, Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children.

 Study Phase 2, Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on HTGC in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children.

 Study Phase 2, Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on carotid CIMT in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children.

The US prevalence of childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of cardiovascular risk, have increased to epidemic proportions in recent decades.

 Children with mental illness, especially those treated with antipsychotic medications, are at additional risk for obesity (adiposity) and related risk conditions.

 A variety of noninvasive techniques to assess cardiometabolic risk have begun to be applied in children, including body composition measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measured by ultrasound, and hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) measured by 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).

 These measures allow for the early, noninvasive study of adiposity-related metabolic risk.

 The overall aim of this two-study research plan is to characterize the level of measurable risk using these sensitive markers in treated and untreated children with mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change in risk that can be observed using these biomarkers in children receiving a well established behavioral weight-loss intervention.
