 ING113086 is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double dummy, active-controlled, multicenter, study conducted in approximately 788 HIV-1 infected ART-naive subjects.

 Subjects will be randomized 1:1 one of the following treatment arms: 1.

 GSK1349572 50 mg once daily (approximately 394 subjects) + fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC) OR 2.

 400 mg RAL twice daily (approximately 394 subjects) + fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC) Analyses will be conducted at 48 weeks and 96 weeks.

 Subjects randomized to receive GSK1349572 and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to GSK1349572 through the study until either it is locally available, as long as they continue to derive clinical benefit.

 ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.
