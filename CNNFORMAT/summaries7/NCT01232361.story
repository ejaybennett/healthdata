(secondQuint)IMPAACT P1080: Psychiatric and Antiretroviral Medication Concentrations in HIV-infected and Uninfected Children and Adolescents.

 P1080 is a pilot population pharmacokinetic study of HIV-1 infected and uninfected children and adolescents who are taking methylphenidate or amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine for the treatment of ADHD.

 Prescribing various psychiatric medications in combination with antiretroviral regimens is a standard clinical practice occurring without adequate evidence regarding benefits and risks.

 The goals of this study are to determine plasma concentrations of psychiatric and antiretroviral medications in children and adolescents.

 Psychiatric medication dose requirement and exposure in HIV-1 infected subjects will be compared to that seen in uninfected children and adolescents, and antiretroviral exposure will be compared to published studies in children and adolescents.
