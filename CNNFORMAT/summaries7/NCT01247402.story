(fifthQuint)Paclitaxel Balloon Versus Standard Balloon in In-stent Restenoses of the Superficial Femoral Artery (PACUBA I Trial).

 Introduction Restenosis after endovascular stenting with nitinol stents occurs in up to 30% of the patients at 12 months and up to 50% at 24 months.

 The rate of recurrence after repeated treatment of SFA in-stent restenoses ranges up to 70% at 6 months.

 A recent clinical trial suggested significant inhibition of re-restenosis after treatment of restenosis in coronary stents by Paclitaxel-coated angioplasty balloons.

 Study Design Prospective monocenter single-blind randomized (1:1) investigator sponsored clinical trial, in which consecutive patients candidates for percutaneous intervention of angioplasty to treat symptomatic in-stent restenosis of the SFA and P1 segment of the popliteal artery will be assigned to one of two study arms: 1.

 Treatment Arm: Paclitaxel eluting percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PePTA) 2.

 Control Arm: standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (sPTA).

 Subject Population: Consecutive subjects with symptomatic in-stent restenosis of the SFA and P1 segment of the popliteal artery will be screened and enrolled based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 Objectives: To evaluate the morphologic and clinical efficacy of Paclitaxel eluting percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PePTA) for the reduction of restenosis in SFA and PA stents compared to standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (sPTA).

 Primary Endpoints: Primary patency at 6 month follow up, defined as 50%* diameter stenosis.

 Secondary Endpoints: 1.

 Technical Success: achievement of a 50 years 2.

 Patient legally authorized to provide written informed consent 3.

 Patient willing and likely to comply with the follow up schedule 4.

 Patient symptomatic Rutherford-Becker 2-5 (Fontaine II-IV) 5.

 In-stent restenosis in the SFA and P1 segment of the popliteal artery (PA) 6.

 Tibial run-off of at least 1 artery which however may be stenotic but amenable to PTA Exclusion Criteria: 1.

 Patients unable to give informed consent 2.

 Patients enrolled in another study with any investigational drug or device 3.

 Major surgical procedures (not including minor amputations) within 30 days prior to this study or planned within 30 days of entry into this study 4.

 Pregnancy 5.

 Patients with any known allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to radiologic contrast media, ASA, Clopidogrel or Ticlopidine, Paclitaxel 6.

 Life expectancy of apart to evaluate lesion morphology, inflow disease and run-off.

 After successful wire passage through the target lesion, patients will be randomly assigned to either Paclitaxel eluting balloon angioplasty (PePTA) or standard percutaneous balloon angioplasty (sPTA) using computer generated random digits and sealed envelopes.

 Medical Therapy: All patients receive aspirin 100mg daily indefinitely and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 3 months post intervention.

 Aspirin and clopidogrel will be initiated at least 1 day prior to the intervention, otherwise a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel will be given during the intervention.

 Control CTA and CDUS: Angiographic evaluation of restenosis at 6 months will performed using contrast enhanced CTA.

 At colour Doppler ultrasound evaluation the wave form, peak systolic and diastolic velocity and the peak systolic velocity ration (PSV ratio) will be measured at 24 hours, 6 and 12 months post Index procedure.

 CDUS findings are consistent with significant restenosis (> 50%), as evidenced by PSV ratio > 2.

5 within the treated arterial segment or occlusion of the treated arterial segment.
