(secondQuint)Attenuation of the Side Effect Profile of Regadenoson: Study With Aminophylline in Patients Undergoing Myocardial Perfusion Imaging.

 Approximately 250 patients who are referred for a nuclear stress testing of the heart with regadenoson (Lexiscan(R)) will be recruited to participate in the study.

 Following regadenoson (administered as part of a stress routine test protocol) participants will receive either aminophylline (75 mg - intravenously) or a matching inactive placebo (sterile salt water) injection.

 Participants will be surveyed for gastrointestinal symptoms and other side effects related to regadenoson.

 The frequency and severity of such side effects will be compared between the two study groups (aminophylline vs.

 placebo).

The routine administration of 75 mg of intravenous aminophylline following regadenoson (Lexiscan(R)), a commonly used medication for nuclear stress testing of the heart, can reduce the gastrointestinal (diarrhea and stomach upset) and other side effects related to regadenoson.
