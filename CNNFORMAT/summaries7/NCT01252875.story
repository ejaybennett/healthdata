(fifthQuint)Treat Stroke to Target.

 The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA : achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL.

 Investigators will use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs.

 Inclusion criteria: - Recent (less than 3 months) ischemic stroke As soon as possible after the event, once the neurologic deficit is stabilized (investigator judgment).

 These ischemic strokes include TIA with ischemic lesion documented by CT or MRI.

 - Or recent TIA (less than 15 days) without documentation of ischemic lesion on CT/MR imaging.

 Must be limb weakness or aphasia lasting more than 10 min.

 - And documented atherosclerotic stenosis in carotid artery (investigator judgment) (based on the results of Duplex echography, CTA, MRA or X ray- angiography), Or in the aortic arch (investigator judgment) (based on TEE or CTA), Or in other brain artery: vertebral, basilar or other intracranial artery (based on CTA, MRA, XRA), Or in coronary arteries (past history of acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization or positive coronary angiography) - And statin treatment is indicated, following ANSM guidelines (French drug agency), age >18 years, rankin score 4, patient or a legal representative signs consent, patient is affiliated to social security system Exclusion criteria : - Ischemic stroke/TIA du to arterial dissection (investigator judgment) - Cardiac source of embolism (e.

g.

, mitral stenosis, endomyocardial fibrosis) without documented atherosclerotic stenosis : a patient with atrial fibrillation or a past history of recent myocardial infarction or calcified aortic stenosis can be randomized if he otherwise fulfils inclusion criteria - Symptomatic hemorrhagic stroke : Presence of microbleeds on gradient echo imaging (T2*) is not an exclusion criteria.

 Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke is not an exclusion criteria - Uncontrolled hypertension (investigator judgment) - LDL-C 0.

1 g / l is higher in carriers of polymorphism 719Arg of the gene KIF-6 than non-carriers of this polymorphism.

 Treat Stroke to Target@highlight

The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA : achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL.

 Investigators will use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs.

 The primary end-point is the occurrence of recurrent non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, and vascular death in each group.

 3760 patients will be recruited and followed for eight and a half years maximum.
