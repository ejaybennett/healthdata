(thirdQuint)Safety Evaluation of an Experimental Treatment, Intradermal Human Fc1-Fel d1 Fusion Protein (GFD), for Cat Allergy.

 Researchers are conducting a research study of a new protein developed to treat sensitivity to cat allergens.

 Cat allergy in humans is an allergic reaction to one or more of the five known allergens produced by cats.

 The most common of these is the protein Fel d 1.

 This study will test Intradermal Human Fc1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD), a new protein that, based on animal data, has been developed to block the allergic effects of cat.

 If this drug works the way they think it does, it may become a treatment for cat allergy that is faster than the currently available treatments and with fewer side effects.

 This protein contains the molecule from the cat, that causes the allergic reaction, attached to a section of a particular antibody (protein involved in immunity) called Fc1 that acts like a break.

 The fusion of the two proteins is predicted to interrupt the flow of cellular reactions which lead to the allergic response.

 This will be the first time GFD is administered to humans.

 The study will be conducted in two parts.

 The subjects in part A will be administered intradermal standardized cat hair allergenic extract (CAT) and GFD sequentially in 10-fold increasing doses every 20 minutes.

 If Part A demonstrates the safety of GFD,subject in part B will begin by following the same treatment as part A followed by a rechallenge of the sites with CAT at 4 hours after the first dose of GFD.

 Each subject will be evaluated 3 times (screening, dosing, and telephone follow-up 2 days post dosing) and will return on Day 28 for blood draw.

 Safety Evaluation of an Experimental Treatment, Intradermal Human Fc1-Fel d1 Fusion Protein (GFD), for Cat Allergy@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to show that Intradermal Human Fc1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD) is able to block the skin reaction to cat allergen in cat allergic subjects compared to the skin reaction to cat allergen alone.

 This research project is also testing the safety and tolerability of this new, experimental treatment, compared to the current treatment of cat allergen alone.
