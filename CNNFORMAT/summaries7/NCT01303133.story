(thirdQuint)Natural History of Amyloid Deposition in Adults With Down Syndrome.

 Specific Aim 1: To assess and compare amyloid deposition (with PiB PET) in non-demented/functionally stable adults with DS across three age cohorts (30-39, 40-49, and >50 years of age).

 Primary Hypothesis 1: At initial assessment, there will be a significantly higher prevalence of amyloid-positive (PiB+) subjects in each succeeding age cohort.

 In addition, we will test the following secondary hypothesis: Secondary Aim 1: To compare the presence or absence of the apolipoprotein-E4 allele to the retention of PiB in various brain areas of the DS subjects.

 Secondary Hypothesis 1: At baseline, subjects who carry at least one Apolipoprotein-E4 (ApoE4) allele will show a higher prevalence of being PiB+.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the presence of amyloid in non-demented/functionally stable adults with DS as a function of age, dividing the sample into amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative groups.

 We will also obtain baseline cognitive measures across a range of areas that are often affected by AD.
