(firstQuint)Effects of a Rehabilitation Program on Physical Performance and Disease Self-management in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

.

 Currently, the effectiveness of a program consisting of education to improve disease self-management combined with intensive exercises is not clear.

 In the present study the investigators developed a group-based program for people with RA consisting of physical exercise to increase physical performance (i.

e.

 aerobic capacity and muscle strength) combined with an educational program to improve disease self-management (self-reported health status and self-efficacy).

 The investigators called it the 'FIT program'.

 The aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the effects of the FIT program on aerobic capacity, muscle strength, self-reported health status and self-efficacy, in a population of people with RA.

 The investigators hypothesized that the FIT-program would have beneficial effects on physical performance (ie.

 aerobic capacity and muscle strength) and disease self-management (i.

e.

 perceived health status and self-efficacy components) compared to a waiting list control group (WLCgroup).

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a group-based exercise and educational program for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) on physical performance and disease-self-management.
