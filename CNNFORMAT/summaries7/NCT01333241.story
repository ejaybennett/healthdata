 Overweight/obesity and physical inactivity are two significant predictors of illness and death from cardiovascular (heart) disease (CVD)in Latina adults.

 These risk factors may be reduced or eliminated through prevention efforts that focus on heart-healthy diets, weight reduction, and PA.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 6-month community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) conducted by promotoras and a control condition (disaster preparedness and home safety program) on BMI (primary outcome) and selected physiologic outcomes (secondary outcomes i.

e.

, physical activity, blood pressure, measures of cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, waist circumference, self-reported lifestyle behaviors - diet and physical activity) of Latinas who are overweight/obese.

 Exploratory analysis will examine the relationship between theoretical variables (stage of change and support for nutrition and physical activity), the LSBI and selected outcomes (BMI, self-reported lifestyle behaviors).

 The LSBI includes group education and individual teaching and coaching.

The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of a community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) that is designed to improve diet, reduce weight and increase physical activity (PA) of Latino women who are predominantly Spanish-speaking immigrants.

 It is hypothesized that middle-aged overweight/obese Latinas participating in a LSBI conducted by promotoras will demonstrate a greater decrease in BMI and a higher increase in physical activity than those in a control condition, Women in the LSBI also are expected to demonstrate improvements in selected physiologic outcomes (blood pressure [BP], measures of cholesterol and blood sugar, waist circumference), and self-reported lifestyle behaviors (diet, PA).
