(fifthQuint)Improving Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among HIV-infected Youth.

 Aims: 1.

 To conduct a randomized controlled pilot test of a behavioral adherence intervention to improve medication adherence among HIV-infected youth aged 13-24.

 Feasibility of all study procedures and participant acceptability will be assessed.

 2.

 To explore whether the intervention leads to improved medication adherence among youth who receive the intervention, compared to a control group of youth who do not.

 40 HIV-infected adolescents will be recruited for a RCT pilot of the Positive STEPS intervention at Fenway Health and Children's Hospital Boston.

 Participants will be randomized into one of two arms (half and half).

 Randomization for all participants will occur after the beginning of the week 2 study visit.

 The duration of the study is 3 months Randomization: The investigators will conduct block randomization based on two categories of electronic adherence: 85% or above versus cent Participants will receive the Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) pill cap monitoring device to measure antiretroviral medication adherence.

 Improving Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among HIV-infected Youth@highlight

HIV is increasing among adolescents and young adults in the US.

 Antiretroviral medications, when taken correctly ( 90% of prescribed doses taken), can vastly improve life expectancy.

 However, adherence among HIV-infected young people is suboptimal, and few interventions are available to help adolescents adhere to treatment.

 The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) pilot trial of Positive STEPS (the adapted form of the Life-Steps behavioral intervention) to improve medication adherence among HIV-infected youth.

 The study will allow us to demonstrate participant acceptance, ability to recruit, feasibility of intervention delivery with study counselors and all study procedures, and initial clinically significant improvement in medication adherence via MEMS caps.

 This research will lay the groundwork for a federal grant application for a multi-site randomized controlled intervention trial.
