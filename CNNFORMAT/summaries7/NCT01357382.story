(fifthQuint)The ACT-OUT Trial: ACTivity OUTcomes Based on High Carbohydrate or High Fat Diet in Metabolic Syndrome.

 1.

 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Current obesity prevention emphasizes increasing physical activity and a low-fat, calorie restricted diet to produce a negative caloric balance.

 Caloric restriction is associated with decreases in energy expenditure.

 The other mainstay of obesity prevention increasing levels of physical activity is associated with greater caloric intake.

 Failure of the eat less-exercise more strategy is evident with epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type II diabetes.

 Moreover, the displacement of dietary fat in the diet has led to compensatory increases in carbohydrate intake that is associated with untoward metabolic effects.

 Carbohydrate restricted diets are controversial despite benefits of this approach.

 The controversy stems from a compensatory increase in dietary fat intake associated with carbohydrate restriction and fears that greater fat intake increases risk of cardiovascular disease.

 Carbohydrate restriction decreases insulin resistance and ameliorates MetS.

 This protocol aims to establish a greater evidence base for carbohydrate restricted diets as a therapeutic option for MetS.

 The investigators will review current knowledge with respect to: (i) obesity and insulin resistance in Canada, (ii) positions of major medical organizations (iii) shortcomings of the current obesity prevention paradigm (iv) why carbohydrate restricted diets work.

 1.

1) Obesity and insulin resistance in Canada In the 1980s low fat, caloric restricted diets became the cornerstone of dietary advice to reduce obesity.

 This approach successfully reduced the percent of calories from fat with a consequential increase in carbohydrate consumption.

 In the ensuing years, obesity become epidemic.

 In Canada, the prevalence of obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2) increased from 10% in 1970s to 23% in 2004 with an additional 36% considered overweight (BMI 25-29.

9).

 As obesity is a risk factor for MetS and type II diabetes, the prevalence of these disorders has also reached epidemic proportions.

 Approximately 2 million Canadians were living with diabetes in 2007 and by 2012 it is estimated that 2.

8 million Canadians will be living with diabetes.

 First Nations communities have been especially hard hit, with a prevalence 3-4 times higher and a younger age of onset than non-First Nations individuals.

 Novel chronic disease prevention strategies are needed to address this crisis.

 Insulin resistance underpins the pathophysiology of obesity, Insulin resistance is a condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells.

 As a result, insulin resistant individuals have both elevated blood glucose, fasting insulin and secrete greater amounts of insulin in response to dietary carbohydrate.

 This compensatory hyperinsulinemia is associated with adverse effects in tissues which retain their sensitivity to insulin.

 Elevated blood glucose levels are associated with advanced glycation end products, reactive oxygen species and low grade inflammation.

 These exposures are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease & diabetes.

 Despite the evidence associating elevated insulin levels to atherogenic changes in the vasculature, it remains a matter of controversy as to whether persistently elevated insulin levels are pathogenic.

 The diagnosis of MetS represents an entry-point for disease prevention efforts in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

 MetS is defined as a high waist circumference in addition to two of the following: high triglycerides, low HDL and elevated blood pressure.

 Other pathophysiologic changes are also observed including low grade inflammation, increased uric acid, prothrombotic state, elevated ApoB, small dense atherogenic LDL and endothelial dysfunction.

 First line treatment for MetS is weight loss leading to reductions in insulin resistance.

 Intensive lifestyle interventions reduce diabetes in high risk subjects.

 Most lifestyle interventions for MetS are predicated on the hypothesis that individuals can initiate and maintain weight loss by restricting calories and increasing physical activity.

 The Diabetes Prevention Program showed that intensive intervention including a low-fat calorie reduced diet and increase in physical activity was associated 1.

5 kg/m2 decrease in BMI and a 58% reduction in incidence of diabetes in individuals at high risk of diabetes.

 Less intensive interventions are associated with more modest changes.

 A study of nutritional counselling was associated with a 0.

4 kg/m2 decrease in BMI.

 Thus, lifestyle interventions which emphasize 'eating less or exercising more have limited value.

 The optimal diet for subjects with MetS has not been examined with hard end-points.

 Small trials have compared carbohydrate restricted diets and low fat diets using surrogate markers.

 A trial of severely obese subjects found greater weight loss and greater improvements in lipid levels and hemoglobin A1c on carbohydrate restricted diet than low fat/calorie restricted diets.

 In a study of adults with MetS, those randomized to the carbohydrate restriction had greater weight loss, lower triglycerides and lower insulin levels than individuals on a calorie restricted, low fat diet.

 These results are consistent with a meta-analysis where carbohydrate restricted diets were associated with improvements in atherogenic dyslipidemia, greater weight loss and better compliance than low fat, calorie restricted diets.

 These studies highlight the advantages of carbohydrate restriction.

2) Fat, sugar and positions of major medical organizations One of the principal barriers to the widespread implementation of carbohydrate restricted diets is the fear that increase in saturated fat consumption with its association with increase in LDL-chol, will result in greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 This diet-heart hypothesis has formed the cornerstone of dietary advice for prevention of chronic disease.

 The avoidance of saturated fat has led to general avoidance of dietary fat.

 There is weak and contradictory evidence that both saturated fat and dietary fat restriction are associated with health benefits.

 The largest test of the diet-heart hypothesis was the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).

 This study randomized women to either a low saturated fat diet or a regular diet.

 After 8 years, women randomized to the low fat diet had lower LDL-chol but no decrease in CVD mortality, incidence of breast or colorectal cancer.

 Consistent with the results of the WHI, a meta-analysis which included 347,747 subjects found no relationship between saturated fat intake and CVD.

 While most experts would agree that it's too early to vindicate saturated fat as the foremost dietary evil, evidence is accumulating highlighting the obesigenic and atherogenic nature of refined carbohydrates.

 A trial aiming to decrease sweetened beverage consumption found the intervention group had 7.

7% less overweight and obese children than controls.

 In NHANES (2006), consumption of added sugar was associated with higher triglycerides and lower HDL.

 A prospective study of Dutch adults found that replacing 5% of calories from saturated fat with high glycemic carbohydrates was associated with a 33% increase in risk of myocardial infarction.

 The current state of scientific confusion over the health effects of (refined) carbohydrates is reflected in the diversity of dietary recommendations.

 American Diabetes Association (ADA) dietary guidelines have suggested that carbohydrate restricted diets are an option for weight loss for up to 1 year.

 In contrast, Canadian Diabetes Association recommends a diet with 45%-60% of calories from carbohydrate with a sucrose intake up to 10% of daily intake.

 The contradictory nature of these positions highlights the need for more research into the health effects of carbohydrate restricted diets.

 The endorsement of carbohydrate restriction by ADA suggests that these diets are valid therapeutic options.

3) Shortcomings of the traditional obesity prevention paradigm The current obesity prevention paradigm emphasizes caloric reduction and/or increased physical activity to produce negative caloric balance.

 While physical activity has established benefits, increasing physical activity as a weight loss strategy has met with disappointing results.

 Observational studies associating high levels of physical activity with lower adiposity are difficult to interpret as individuals with higher physical activity also benefit from other (unmeasured) health promoting behaviours.

 In randomized trials, physical activity interventions have shown equivocal results with respect to weight loss.

 The physiologic limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to augment physical activity without a compensatory increase in dietary intake.

 In studies where physical activity is directly supervised and in the absence of a compensatory increase in caloric intake, physical activity has been associated with weight loss C.

 As changes in insulin action are central to our hypothesis the investigators will assess two distinct aspects of insulin metabolism in this study, insulin secretion and insulin resistance.

 The investigators will assess insulin resistance using HOMA assessment of insulin resistance calculated from fasting insulin and fasting glucose.

 The investigators will assess the concentration of C-peptide, a cleavage product related to insulin synthesis that is synthesized in equimolar concentrations to insulin.

 As C-peptide has a longer half-life than insulin, it can be used a marker of insulin secretion from the pancreas.

 Blood Pressure will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using BP-TRU monitors.

 Lipid, lipoprotein and C-reactive protein levels will be measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months.

 Total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B will be measured using previously described methods.

 LDL-chol levels will be calculated using the Friedewald formula for patients whose plasma triglyceride level is less than 4 mmol/L.

 -hydroxybutyrate will also be assessed in both groups at the aforementioned time points and will be used as a biomarker of adherence to a carbohydrate restricted diet.

 The investigators will also assess serum Leptin and uric acid at baseline and 6 months.

 Statistical analyses: The investigators will use two different approaches to analyze the data.

 First the investigators will use an intention to treat analysis using baseline values to impute missing data in participants who may drop-out of the study.

 The investigators will also examine the effect of the dietary assignment on outcomes in participants who were compliant with their dietary assignment.

 Baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups using t tests.

 The investigators will examine three inter-related dependent variables, capturing different aspects of physical activity, in the analysis strategy.

 First, the investigators will examine the association between dietary assignment and changes in accelerometer variables.

 The investigators will also examine time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and activity based energy expenditure.

 As activity based energy will be estimated from accelerometer , the investigators will not consider it a unique comparison.

 The investigators will thus set the level of statistical significance at p<0.

025 to adjust for multiple comparisons.

 The investigators will obtain differences in key variables such as physical activity and change in insulin concentration.

 To assess the effects of the dietary assignment on physical activity, the investigators will use three-way repeated-measures ANOVA, including change in body weight in the model with time as the repeated factor.

 The ACT-OUT Trial: ACTivity OUTcomes Based on High Carbohydrate or High Fat Diet in Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

Current obesity prevention emphasizes caloric restriction and avoidance of high fat foods.

 The result is an approach that replaces dietary fat with carbohydrates.

 There has, however, since been an obesity epidemic with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type II diabetes.

 Negative results from trials of low fat diets for weight loss, prevention of heart disease and malignancies are consistent with the inadequacy of low fat/high carbohydrate approach.

 One of the findings of trials comparing low fat, calorie reduced diets to ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets is that subjects randomized to a low carbohydrate intake lose more weight despite equivalent intake.

 This equates to a 200 kcal/day greater weight loss on a carbohydrate restricted diet.

 Some investigators have speculated the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restriction is due to increased energetic costs of gluconeogenesis.

 Alternatively, carbohydrate restriction is associated with increases in spontaneous physical activity.

 This protocol has three aims.

 First, adherence to a carbohydrate restricted diet in subjects with metabolic syndrome will cause an increase in spontaneous physical activity, independent of weight changes.

 Second, cardiometabolic risk factors (ApoB, TG, HDL, blood pressure, CRP) will show greater improvement on a carbohydrate restricted diet compared to a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet.

 Finally the investigators will interview a sub-sample of participants to better understand quality of life issues with respect to the dietary assignment or lifestyle intervention.

 The investigators will recruit 72 participants with MetS, from the Metabolic Syndrome Program at St.

 Paul's Hospital, Vancouver.

 Individuals will be randomized to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a calorie restricted, low fat diet and followed for 6 months.

 The investigators will measure body composition with bioelectrical impedance at baseline, 3 and 6 months.

 The investigators will also examine cardiometabolic changes due to the standard lifestyle intervention compared to the carbohydrate restricted treatment.

 The investigators will examine blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-chol, HDL-chol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c and leptin at baseline, 3 and 6 months.

 The investigators will use accelerometers to assess changes in physical activity.

 The investigators will use three-way repeated-measures ANOVA, with changes in body weight and insulin levels as covariates in the model with time as the repeated factor for statistical analyses.
