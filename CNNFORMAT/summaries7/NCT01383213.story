(secondQuint)Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Versus Oxygen Venturi in Severe Acute Respiratory Failure in Pneumonia.

 Pneumonia is one of the commonest causes of hospitalised acute respiratory failure with a mortality rate up to 30%.

 Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has ben recently proved to be effective.

 To date, however, no prospective randomised study has been published on the comparison between CPAP and O2 administration by Venturi mask for the treatment of severe acute respiratory failure in patients with pneumonia.

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of CPAP application by a helmet and O2 administration by a Venturi mask in terms of achievement of criteria for endotracheal intubation during severe acute respiratory failure caused by pneumonia
