(fifthQuint)DAAOI-1 Treatment for Treatment-resistant Schizophrenia.

 Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has limitations such as residual positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects.

 Refractory schizophrenia (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult clinical issue at present.

 Among schizophrenia patients, around 20-25%are treatment-resistant.

 According to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) hypothesis, many clinical trials on NMDA-enhancing agents were studied.

 Adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids (D-serine, D-alanine), and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive and negative symptoms.

 The investigators recently started to study the potential of DAAOI-1, a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor which can elevate synaptic concentration of D-amino acids.

 The aims of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-1 adjuvant treatment for clozapine-resistant refractory schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo - controlled trial.
