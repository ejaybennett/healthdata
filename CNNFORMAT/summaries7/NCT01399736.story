(fifthQuint)Comparison Between FFR Guided Revascularization Versus Conventional Strategy in Acute STEMI Patients With MVD.

.

 Background of the study: At the moment the general opinion is divided over the way the non culprit lesions in patients presenting with STEMI should be treated.

 While the previous guidelines stead that these lesions should be treated in a second time ( ie not during the primary intervention) the actual guidelines do not touch this argument.

 The reason is that the studies where the previous guidelines were based are old.

 Meanwhile small sized randomised trials from EU region have proven favourable outcomes with NON infarct related artery during the primary procedure while registers (non randomised trials) from USA still recommend the staged treatment.

 For this reason we have decided to perform a randomised study to address this issue incorporating the state of the art diagnosis and treatment, as well as the new medical therapy and PCI techniques.

 Objective of the study: FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all flow-limiting stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI or within the same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the guidelines Study design: Prospective, 1: 2 randomisation.

 FFR guided revascularisation during primary PCI (1) versus following actual guidelines (2) Study population: All STEMI patients between 18-85 years who will be treated with primary PCI in 50% in a non-IRA judged feasible for treatment with PCI.

 Intervention (if applicable): FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all flow-limiting stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI or within the same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the guidelines Primary study parameters/outcome of the study: Composite endpoint of all cause mortality non-fatal Myocardial Infarction, any Revascularisation and Stroke (MACCE) at 12 months.

 Comparison Between FFR Guided Revascularization Versus Conventional Strategy in Acute STEMI Patients With MVD.

The Compare-Acute trial is a prospective randomised trial in patients with multivessel disease, who are admitted into hospital with a ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction.

 The purpose of the study is to compare a FFR guided multivessel PCI taking place during the primary PCI with a primary PCI of the culprit vessel only.

 Patients will be enrolled after successful revascularisation of the culprit vessel.

 Patients that have at least one lesion with a diameter of stenosis of more than 50% on visual estimation, feasible (operators judgement) for treatment with PCI in a non-infarct related artery, will be randomised either to the FFR guided complete revascularisation arm or staged revascularisation by proven ischemia or persistence of symptoms of angina.

 Approximately 885 patients will be entered in the study.

 Study hypothesis: FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all flow-limiting stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI or within the same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the guidelines.
