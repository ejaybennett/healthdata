(secondQuint)R-CVP for the Treatment of Non-conjunctival Ocular Adnexal MALT Lymphoma (OAML).

 The treatment of stage I or II OAML is mainly composed of radiotherapy because chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) did not show the acceptable response rate compared with radiotherapy.

 However, radiotherapy for this disease can cause many complications of eyes.

 This clinical trial was designed to examine the efficacy of R-CVP combination therapy as a first-line treatment for stage I or II non-conjunctival OAML aiming to avoid radiation hazard and increase the efficacy of CVP chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study is to determine how efficient the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP) is in the treatment of stage I or II non-conjunctival ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML).
