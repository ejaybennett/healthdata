(thirdQuint)A Comparison of the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Proseal and LMA Supreme in Children.

 The goal of this study is to compare the LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme in children having surgery.

 The investigators hypothesize that the airway leak pressures with the LMA Proseal will be superior to the LMA Supreme.

 Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached.

 The ease of placement of the device and gastric tube, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, feasibility of use during positive pressure ventilation, and complications (airway related, gastric insufflation, trauma) will also be assessed.

 A Comparison of the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Proseal and LMA Supreme in Children@highlight

The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two laryngeal mask airways with a provision for evacuation of gastric contents, the LMA Proseal and The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Proseal will be significantly different (higher) when compared with the LMA Supreme.
