(fifthQuint)Dolutegravir Compared to Darunavir/Ritonavir , Each in Combination With Dual Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) in ART-naive Subjects.

 ING114915 is a Phase IIIb randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel group, fully-powered non-inferiority study.

 The study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected ART-naive subjects.

 Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC).

 The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.

 Subjects who fulfil eligibility requirements will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once daily or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily.

 In order to achieve balance across the two treatment groups of the study, randomization will be stratified by: screening plasma HIV-1 RNA >/ 100,000 copies/mL (c/mL) or > 100,000 c/mL and background dual NRTI (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC) The DTG and DRV/r doses will be administered in an open-label fashion throughout the study.

 Subjects randomized to receive DTG and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to DTG until either it is locally approved and commercially available, the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of DTG is terminated.

 Subjects randomized to the DRV/r arm will receive DRV/r through their Week 96 visit, after which they will be discontinued from the study and will need to make alternative arrangements to access antiretroviral medication.

 All subjects will receive background dual-NRTI therapy through their Week 96 visit.

 Dolutegravir Compared to Darunavir/Ritonavir , Each in Combination With Dual Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) in ART-naive Subjects@highlight

This study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive subjects.

 Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC).

 Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA and background NRTI selection.

 The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.
