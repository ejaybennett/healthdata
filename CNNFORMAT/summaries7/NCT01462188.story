(secondQuint)Optimizing Infarct Size by Transforming Emergent Stenting Into an Elective Procedure Study.

 In the setting of largely thrombotic lesions such as those treated in the context of primary PCI, stenting often results in distal micro and macro-embolisation which hampers coronary flow and microvascular recovery.

 Interestingly in some of these studies comparing BMS versus balloon angioplasty an early hazard associated to the use of stent has been reported.

 Thus, investigators hypothesize in this protocol that refraining from stenting during the acute phase of ST segment myocardial infarction is safe and associated to improved myocardial recovery as compared to acute stenting.

The goal of primary PCI is to restore anterograde myocardial flow.

 Stenting a largely thrombotic lesion may determine distal embolisation of thrombotic material therefore deteriorating myocardial perfusion.
