(fifthQuint)Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Older Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the tolerability (grade 2-5 toxicity, neuropathy grade 2 or higher, need for dose reductions, or delays) of weekly nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in older adults with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the efficacy (response and time to progression) of weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer using a stratification factor based on patient age (at least 5 patients age 75 years or older and no more than 15 patients age 65-70 years).

 II.

 To explore predictors of the need for dose reduction, dose delays, or grade 2-5 toxicity and neuropathy grade 2 or higher based on a cancer-specific geriatric assessment.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Older Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial studies the side effects of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation in treating older patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic).

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
