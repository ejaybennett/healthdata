(fifthQuint)First in Man Study Investigating the Biodistribution, the Safety and Optimal Recommended Dose of a New Radiolabelled Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Frizzled Homolog 10.

 PART 1: Imaging with OTSA101 DTPA-111In OTSA101-DTPA-111In (1.

5mg OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 185 MBq of 11In) will be administered intravenously (IV) as a single injection on Day -28 (D-28).

 Patients will undergo serial anterior-posterior gamma scans and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) at 1, 5, 24, 48, 72, 144 hours post-dosing to estimate absorbed radiation doses to tumor, to normal organs (i.

e.

, liver, lung, kidney, and bone marrow), and whole body in order to determine OTSA101-DTPA-111In tumor uptake (ID%/g [% of injected dose (ID) per gram of tumor]) and biodistribution (ratio tumor/normal tissue of estimated radiation-absorbed dose).

 PK sampling will be performed at the same time points with additional sampling at D-14 and D0.

 A Steering Committee meeting is planned at the end of PART 1 for each patient.

 The Steering Committee will evaluate on a case by case basis at Day -7 for each patient if he/she can proceed to the therapeutic part based on tumor targeting, biodistribution, safety and clinical assessments: - Patients with expected biodistribution and tumor uptake, no safety concerns and no overt signs of disease progression will proceed to the therapeutic part of the study after validation by the Steering Committee.

 - Patients displaying abnormal/unexpected biodistribution of OTSA101-DTPA-111In, safety concerns and/or overt sign of disease progression will be taken off the study and other therapeutic plan will be envisaged.

 PART 2: Therapeutic dose of OTSA101-DTPA-90Y OTSA101-DTPA-90Y will be administered IV as a single injection on Day 0 (i.

e.

 14 days after the injection of OTSA101-DTPA-111In - A 1week-delay [i.

e.

 +7 days] is authorized from the planned D0).

 Twelve (12) patients should be randomized in the PART 2 and treated with OTSA101-DTPA-90Y at two initial dose levels (6 patients per dose level): - Arm A: 1.

5 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 370MBq of 90Y (Dose level 1 (DL1) - Arm B: 1.

5 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 1110 MBq of 90Y (Dose level 2 (DL2) Based on safety and preliminary efficacy data, a third dose level will be evaluated in 6 additional patients: - Arm C: 3 mg of OTSA101-DTPA radiolabeled with 2220 MBq of 90Y (Dose level 3 (DL3).

 Such a study design will allow the determination of an optimal and recommended dose, surrounded by a lower suboptimal dose and a higher maximal tolerated (or possibly toxic) dose.

 The first 3 patients will be enrolled at Centre Leon Berard.

 Following the randomization of the first 2 patients, the accrual will be stopped for a maximal period of 1 month.

 The safety data will be reviewed every 2 randomized patients.

 Thee benefit/risk ratio will be regularly reviewed by the iDSMB and the Steering Committee (See Section Study Committee).

 A compassionate program is planned for all randomized patients who derive clinical benefit from the study drug (at least stable disease and acceptable tolerance).

 A maximum of 4 injections per year will be planned.

 Subsequent injection will be performed provided that the eligibility criteria (except criteria related to previous treatment) are met before the day of administration.

 All inclusion in the compassionate program will be validated by the Steering Committee.

 First in Man Study Investigating the Biodistribution, the Safety and Optimal Recommended Dose of a New Radiolabelled Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Frizzled Homolog 10@highlight

Advanced synovial sarcoma represents an unmet medical need.

 The gene encoding frizzled homologue 10 (FZD10), a 7-transmenbrane receptor, member of the Wnt signalling receptor family, is overexpressed in SS and is undetectable in normal human tissues except placenta.

 OncoTherapy Science Inc.

 has developed a chimeric humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) against FZD10, named OTSA101.

 Non-radiolabeled OTSA101 antibody has only weak antagonistic activity on SS cell growth.

 However, Yttrium 90-radiolabeled OTSA101 (OTSA101-DTPA-90Y) showed significant antitumor activity following a single intravenous injection in mouse xenograft model.

 This first in man clinical trial (Phase I) in relapsing SS patients resistant to Doxorubicin and ifosfamide will be divided in 2 parts.

 In Part 1 (imaging part using OTSA101 radiolabelled with Indium 111 [111In]), the biodistribution and tumor uptake of OTSA101-DTPA-111In will be followed using 111In as radiotracer.

 In Part 2 (therapeutic part with OTSA101 radiolabelled with Yttrium 90 [90Y]), the safety and PK profiles of OTSA101-DTPA-90Y will be determined and preliminary efficacy data will be collected.

 This first in Man study should allow defining the optimal recommended dose of OTSA101-DTPA-90Y.

 Patients will be followed during 1 year.
