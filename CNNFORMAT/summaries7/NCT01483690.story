(secondQuint)A Pilot Study of Decitabine and Vorinostat With Chemotherapy for Relapsed ALL.

 Decitabine is a demethylating agent and vorinostat is a HDAC inhibitor.

 The use of demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in combination have been previously shown to have synergistic effects in altering neoplastic pathways of cancer cells and be well tolerated in human clinical studies.

 With the ability of decitabine and vorinostat to alter the abnormal cellular pathways of leukemic blasts and essentially turn off anti-apoptotic proteins, the leukemia cells have become primed for cytotoxic cell kill via chemotherapeutic agents.

 This study will ask the question as to whether or not the combination of decitabine and vorinostat followed by chemotherapy is feasible and whether it can positively impact outcome in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

 A Pilot Study of Decitabine and Vorinostat With Chemotherapy for Relapsed ALL@highlight

This is a pilot study using decitabine and vorinostat before and during chemotherapy with vincristine, dexamethasone, mitoxantrone, and peg-asparaginase in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
