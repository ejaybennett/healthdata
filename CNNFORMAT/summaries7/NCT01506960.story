(secondQuint)Evaluation of a Combined Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Catheter for Detection of Lipid Rich Plaque.

 The aims of this study are to: 1.

 Test the ability of the new NIRS IVUS system to detect lipid pool 2.

 Evaluate the accuracy of the NIRS IVUS system for localization of lipide rich plaque: superficial vs deep 3.

 Improve diagnostic accuracy of OCT for detection of lipid using information from NIRS IVUS.

 Evaluation of a Combined Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) Catheter for Detection of Lipid Rich Plaque@highlight

The purpose of this study is to learn more about lipid rich plaque using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)/Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging in patients who have had coronary artery stenting and Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.
