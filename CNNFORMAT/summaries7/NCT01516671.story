(thirdQuint)Neuroinflammation and Bispectral Index After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or bleeding in the brain is a form of stroke.

 SAH mostly results from ruptured aneurysms.

 This severe disease often results in death or severe physical or cognitive disabilities and reduced quality of life.

 One frequent complication after SAH is cerebral vasospasm, a spasm of the big arteries accompanied by infarction of healthy brain tissue.

 The pathophysiologic processes which drive vasospasm remain unclear.

 This study aims to examine the role of endocannabinoids and cortisol in cerebrospinal fluid during the development of cerebral vasospasm.

 Additionally, this study examines whether side difference in the processed electroencephalogram (bilateral bispectral index) may be useful for early detection of cerebral vasospasm.

 Neuroinflammation and Bispectral Index After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage@highlight

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with a high mortality and frequently leads to severe disability in survivors caused by cerebral vasospasm and infarction.

 This study aims to elucidate the role of neuroinflammation (endocannabinoids and cortisol levels in cerebrospinal fluid) in the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm and the value of the bilateral bispectral index (BIS) for the early diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm.
