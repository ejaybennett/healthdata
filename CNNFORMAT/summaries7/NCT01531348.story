(firstQuint)Feasibility and Safety of Human Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Intravitreal Injection in Patients With Retinitis Pigmentosa.

 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited disorder of the photoreceptor cells in the retina.

 Patients may lose vision since they were young or later in life.

 Currently, there are more than 60 genes identified as the cause of this condition, one of which, RPE65, has been studied in several gene therapy trials for Leber congenital amaurosis with promising results.

 Another treatment approach for RP is stem cell therapy.

 Studies in animal models of RP have shown that subretinal injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells may delay degenerative changes of photoreceptor cells.
