(fifthQuint)Assessment of Eloquent Function in Brain Tumor Patients.

 Any patient with a primary or metastatic brain tumor in or near an eloquent area would be eligible for participation in the study assuming no contraindications to any of the studies or operative procedure.

 Pre-operative: Evaluation will include clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI brain with and without contrast, fMRI, DTI tractograms, and MEG studies as well as standard pre-operative work-up.

 Intra-operative: All non-invasive pre-operative mapping data will be incorporated into the operative procedure with the imaging tools that we routinely use during neurosurgical procedures.

 Patients will have awake mapping performed.

 Our usual standards of care will be followed during craniotomy, mapping, and tumor resection or biopsy.

 Post-operative: Patients will have routine post-operative care and assessment consisting of clinical examinations and imaging obtained within 24 hours post resection.

 They will have routine follow-up outpatient appointments after surgery which will include neurologic assessment and follow-up imaging (MRI with and without contrast) for their tumors as appropriate.

 The experimental portion of the protocol is incorporating repeat neuropsychological testing and mapping studies (fMRI, DTI, MEG) studies at 2 and 6 months post-surgery into their routine follow-up.

 Assessment of Eloquent Function in Brain Tumor Patients@highlight

Purpose of the study: AIM 1 Prospectively collect pre-operative (fMRI, DTI, MEG) and intra-operative mapping data in patients with intra-axial brain tumors to assess how well each modality predicts the location of eloquent brain function.

 In addition, each modality will be compared with the other.

 AIM 2 Assess reorganization of eloquent brain function and plasticity in patients with intra-axial brain tumors.

 This will be accomplished by prospectively collecting post-operative mapping studies and neuropsychological tests to compare them to prior mapping studies as stated above.
