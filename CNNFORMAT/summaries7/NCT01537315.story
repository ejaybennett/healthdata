(fifthQuint)Hydroxychloroquine in Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Proof of Concept Study.

 This pilot study has been designed to look at the impact of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the clinical model of accelerated atherosclerosis (AS) in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population.

 This intervention is designed to have an impact on the initiation and progression of AS by reducing systemic inflammation, improving or restoring vascular endothelial function, and by improving the milieu of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

 The current study is a proof of concept study for the expansion of the use of HCQ for a new indication for the treatment of AS and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CKD.

University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) for a new indication on 4/28/11.

 The FDA responded that this study is exempt from an IND.

 This "Proof-of-Concept" randomized double blinded placebo controlled study will evaluate the nature and extent of HCQ effects, and if found significantly beneficial, it will be used to guide the development of a large, multicenter, randomized control trial of HCQ to examine the hard clinical end points of CVD and mortality in patients with advanced CKD.

 The investigators propose to enroll 62 subjects to achieve the effects of HCQ in 52 individuals (39 HCQ group and 13 placebo group).

 Hydroxychloroquine in Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Proof of Concept Study@highlight

Presence of multiple traditional and nontraditional risk factors of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) including inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) contribute to high CVD morbidity and mortality in this patient population.

 Additionally, the traditional approaches towards the therapy of CVD have little impact on CV mortality in these patients.

 Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) used as anti-inflammatory in rheumatological disorders, has multiple beneficial properties relevant to the process of vascular disease.

 The effects of HCQ on atherosclerosis (AS) and vascular disease in CKD is not known yet.

 Thus, the study hypothesis is that HCQ treatment in individuals with CKD will provide clinically significant benefit in the management of CVD and will provide biological and functional atherosclerotic benefits.
