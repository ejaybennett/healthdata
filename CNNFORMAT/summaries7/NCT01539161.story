(fifthQuint)Reveal Chagas: Clinical Evidence of the Implantable Cardiac Monitor in Patients With Chagas Disease.

 The purpose is to study the possible benefit of a superior treatment decision rate for cardiac arrhythmias (brady- and or/ tachyarrhythmias) using an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) in patients with Chagas Disease diagnosed by serology, who are asymptomatic and/or minimally symptomatic.

 Patients that meet inclusion criteria of the study will be randomized to standard care or standard care plus ICM.

 Approximately half of the patients will receive an ICM.

 All patients will be followed for 36 months.

 It is expected that the enrollment phase will last 1 year, and that the total study duration will be 4 years.

 The study is expected to end in 2017.

 One hundred and two patients are needed for 95% confidence level and 80% statistical power to be randomized into the study, at approximately 5 centers in Latin America.

 Patients will be considered enrolled once they have signed the Informed Consent.

 The following additional parameters will also be collected: - Recorded arrhythmic events stored within the ICM (bradyarrhythmia and tachyarrhythmia) - Time duration spent in arrhythmia and incidence of symptomatic arrhythmias in patients with an ICM.

 - Clinical data on subject outcomes and changes in heart failure as assessed by heart failure hospitalizations, New York Heart Association class and mortality.

The study "Reveal Chagas: Clinical Evidence of the Implantable Cardiac Monitor in Patients with Chagas Disease" is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study that is being conducted at several centers in Latin America with commercially available products.

 The primary study hypothesis is that patients with implantable cardiac monitors will have a shorter time to the decision to treat for electrical or arrhythmic disorders during the follow-up period.

 The geography includes Argentina and Colombia.
