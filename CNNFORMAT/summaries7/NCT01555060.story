(thirdQuint)Hemoglobin and Iron Recovery Study.

 The effect of taking iron supplements after blood donation on time to recovery of hemoglobin has been documented but it is not clear whether the benefits of iron supplements vary with age, gender or iron stores.

 To study this issue, individuals who are eligible to donate blood, based on hemoglobin level, will be randomized to receive daily iron supplements or no supplements.

 Randomization will be stratified on gender (male or female), age (26 vs serum ferritin no greater than 26).

 Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks with periodic blood draws to determine time to recovery of hemoglobin and iron stores.

 A 7 ml (about 1.

5 teaspoons) blood sample will be drawn at each of seven study visits over the 24 weeks to track recovery of hemoglobin and iron.

 Hemoglobin and Iron Recovery Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of daily iron supplements after blood donation on time to recovery of hemoglobin and iron stores.

 The study will also determine whether the effect of iron supplements on time to recovery is different in men and women, in older vs.

 younger donors (<60 years old vs.

 at least 60 years old) and in donors with replete vs.

 diminished pre-donation iron stores.
