(fifthQuint)Sotatercept (ACE-011) With Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

 After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research study: Assignment to dose level of study treatment Since we are looking for the highest dose of the ACE 011 combined with lenalidomide that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of these drugs.

 The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.

 Study treatment Study treatment will be given in 28 day cycles.

 - ACE-011 will be given as an injection under the skin, Day 1 of each cycle (every 28 days).

 You will receive each injection at the clinic.

 - Lenalidomide will be taken by mouth: once daily days 1 21, followed by a 7 day rest period during which no lenalidomide will be taken.

 - Dexamethasone will be taken by mouth once per week (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) of each cycle.

 You will be given drug diaries to record the doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone taken.

 The study staff will tell you how to complete the diaries.

 Sotatercept (ACE-011) With Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma@highlight

It is possible that the combination of lenalidomide, dexamethasone and ACE 011 may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells along with improving anemia and bone lesions that sometimes occur in people with multiple myeloma.

 This current study is the first study combining ACE 011 with lenalidomide.

 In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest dose of ACE 011 that can be given with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

 The investigators will also begin to collect information about the effect of the combination of ACE 011, lenalidomide and dexamethasone on multiple myeloma.
