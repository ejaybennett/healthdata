(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of the Accent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Pacemaker and Tendril MRI Lead.

 The safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI lead will be evaluated as described below: Lead Safety Safety of the Tendril MRI cent lead will be evaluated in terms of freedom from RA and RV lead-related complications at implant to 2 months, and at the 2 through the 12 month visit.

 MRI Safety The safety of the Accent MRI cent system will be evaluated in terms of freedom from MRI scan related complications in the month following the MRI scan.

 Lead Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI cent lead will be evaluated in terms of the change in atrial and ventricular capture and sensing thresholds before and after the MRI scan.

 Secondary Endpoints Safety Safety of the Accent MRI cent system will be evaluated in terms of freedom from system-related complications through the 12 month visit.

 Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI cent lead will be evaluated in terms of the atrial and ventricular capture thresholds at the MRI Visit.
