(secondQuint)A Study to Assess the Effects of GSK573719/VI Combination and GSK573719 Monotherapy in Subjects With Moderate Hepatic Impairment and Matched Healthy Volunteers.

 GSK573719 is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with vilanterol for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

 This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled GSK573719/ vilanterol (VI) and GSK573719 in healthy subjects and in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.

 Nine subjects with moderate hepatic impairment will be recruited, together with nine matched healthy volunteers.

 There is a possibility that when used by patients with impaired hepatic function the pharmacokinetics of inhaled GSK573719 or GSK572719/VI may be altered.

 The results of this study will therefore provide guidance on the use of GSK573719 and GSK573719/VI in moderate hepatically impaired patients.
