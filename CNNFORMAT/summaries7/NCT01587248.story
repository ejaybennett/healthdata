(thirdQuint)Use of Harmonic in Breast Surgery.

 In this randomized controlled trial, adult females who underwent MRM between April 2010 and July 2011 were randomized to receive either intervention A (harmonic scalpel) or B (electrocautery).

 The procedure was standardized except elevation of flaps and axillary dissection, that was performed as per randomization.

 Patients were followed up in clinic for four weeks.

 The outcomes were estimated blood loss (EBL), operating time, drain Volume and drain Days, complications (seroma, surgical site infection, hematoma and flap necrosis) and postoperative pain.

 estimated blood loss (EBL), operating time, drain Volume and drain Days, seroma formation, surgical site infection and postoperative pain in adult females undergoing MRM at a tertiary care hospital.

 We hypothesized that harmonic yields better outcome than electrocautery dissection.
