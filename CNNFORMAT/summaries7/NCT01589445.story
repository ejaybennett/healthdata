(fifthQuint)Efficacy Study of Pioglitazone and Metformin and Association Between Pioglitazone Response and Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma Gene Variants in Bangladeshi Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects.

 1.

 Introduction Thiazolidinediones and metformin are known drugs and especially metformin is widely used medicine to treat people with T2DM.

 Though pioglitazone has been suspended in many countries, its safety and efficacy is a matter of research for the drug investigators.

 Thiazolidinediones had been introduced in 1997 as an oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD).

 Metformin has been used as the key compound to treat T2DM for many years and is the most prescribed OAD worldwide.

 Both metformin and thiazolidinediones are considered as "insulin sensitizer".

 The ss-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are the core defects in the progression of T2DM with associated metabolic syndrome.

 Evidence suggests that pioglitazone lowers glucose in blood by increasing glucose uptake into cell and metformin by decreasing glucose production.

 However, there are many controversies in clinical study specially about the improvement of insulin action of metformin.

 In contrast, a research recommended pioglitazone as the most appropriate OAD for the South Asian population.

 The key to this argument is that since pioglitazone is a proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR- or PPARG) [a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes] agonist and decreases insulin resistance, overall glycemic control seems to be better with this thiazolidinedione.

 However, there are very few published documents on the efficacy and safety of these drugs in South Asians.

 To the best of our knowledge, there is no published paper that examined and compared the efficacy and safety of these two drugs in Bangladeshi patients T2DM.

 This double-blind trail therefore examined the efficacy and safety of pioglitazone and metformin in T2DM individuals and also the association of the effects of pioglitazone and the variants of PPARG.

 We have compared the effects of pioglitazone with metformin on biomedical variables in T2DM patients who were eligible for oral hypoglycaemic therapy and then we also analyzed the association among the effects of pioglitazone and PPARG variants.

 Methodology 1.

 Study Setting: The study was conducted between November 2008 and September 2010.

 The participants for this study were recruited from the outdoor, BIRDEM Hospital in Dhaka,Bangladesh.

 2.

 Subjects I.

Individuals who had been diagnosed with T2DM treating with diet/exercise or Metformin 850 mg or Pioglitazone 30mg once daily, and were attending Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) of BIRDEM for consultation were approached by the researcher and invited to participate in the study.

 The patients were diagnosed already and registered in BIRDEM.

 T2DM was ascertained based on World Health Organization recommended criteria two repeated measures of fasting (plasma glucose 7.

0 mmol / l or 2-h plasma glucose 11.

1 mmol / l.

) II.

We screened a total of 130 patients for eligibility and selected 80 patients for enrollment based of our inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 But 77 T2DM patients with HbA1c level 25, SGPT 100 IU/L , creatinine 1.

2 mg/dl) of both sexes, aged between 40-50, treated by monotherapy of pioglitazone or metformin received the drug for the trial according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 53 patients were screening failure as some did not match eligibility criteria (n=39), some refused to take part(n=11)and some were unable to take part (n=03)due to unknown cause.

 Patient Preparation: I.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before study entry.

 Patients were instructed to follow adhere to a disease- and weight-orientated diet throughout the study as before.

 II.

Each case history was documented in the case report form.

 The study was approved by the National Medical Ethics Review Boards (NMERB) of Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC).

The investigations were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.

 4.

 Treatment: The patients were to receive treatment pioglitazone tablet 001 (30mg once per day) for 3 months followed by one month "metformin wash-out period", then to the alternative treatment regimen for further 3 months with metformin tablet 002 (850mg once per day).

 The drugs were supplied by the Aristopharma Pharmaceutical Ltd.

, Bangladesh.

 5.

 Anthropometric Measurements I.

Height: Standing height was measured using appropriate scales (Detect-Medic, Detect scales INC, USA) without shoes.

 II.

Weight: Weight was measured with the balance was placed on a hard flat surface and checked for zero balance before measurement.

 The subjects were in the center of the platform wearing light cloths without shoes.

 III.

BMI: Body mass indexes (BMI) of the subjects were calculated using standard formula: BMI= Weight (kg)/[Height (m)] 2.

 IV.

Blood Pressure: Systemic and Diastolic pressure was measured according to WHO-IHS.

 6.

 Blood Sample Collection for Biochemical analysis : I.

 During the appointed date the patients came in the fasting condition.

 Fasting blood samples (10 ml) were drawn from the antecubital vein.

 The time was mentioned as 0 hour.

 Then the patients received drug.

 They were requested to swallow the tablet and have their breakfast according to their diet charts.

 Next blood sample had been drawn at 30 min and 2 hour and then they were provided the drugs for the whole month.

 II.

The patients were requested to take the drug just before the breakfast every day for 29 days.

 III.

From the fasting blood sample 1ml of blood was transferred in an EDTA containing tube for measurement of HbA1C and the rest of the blood was taken in an EDTA containing tube and centrifuged immediately.

 IV.

Samples after processing were divided into two aliquots under sterile condition;one aliquot was sent for biochemical analysis for Fasting glucose, Lipid profile, Cholesterol, ALT, Insulin, Creatinine and another one was stored at -80 0C for further verification of results in case of any necessity.
