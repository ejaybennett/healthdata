 Patients must have confirmed Type I or Type II Diabetes.

 Patients will receive treatment every week for 12 weeks duration in the Single-Blind Treatment phase of the trial.

 Patients who receive Grafix(R) or control will be evaluated for primary efficacy up to 84 days, and for safety and wound re-occurrence for 84 days after wound closure.
