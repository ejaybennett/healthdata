(thirdQuint)NT-proBNP as a Tool for the Detection of Acute Pulmonary Artery Embolism (APE).

 In patients with suspected APE referred to the intensive care unit after major surgery, serum NT-proBNP, Troponin-I and D-dimers were measured according to the standard hospital protocol.

 Blood samples were obtained within one hour after the onset of clinical symptoms.
