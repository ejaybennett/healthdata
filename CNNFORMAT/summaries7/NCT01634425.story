(thirdQuint)Providing Rapid Out of Hospital Acute Cardiovascular Treatment (PROACT).

 Utilizing the platform of pre-hospital STEMI research and clinical experience developed over the past decade; we now intend to investigate how best to achieve timely diagnosis and risk stratification of patients that present to pre-hospital emergency medical services with symptoms suspicious for acute NSTEMI through utilization of systematic clinical assessment, pre-hospital 12 lead electrocardiogram and point of care measurement of biomarkers.

 Additionally, where deemed appropriate these patients will be enrolled in a clinical Chest Pain Protocol utilizing the pre-hospital biomarkers.

 We hypothesize that establishing a pre-hospital diagnosis in this condition may facilitate efficient triage and -as appropriate- in-hospital disposition.

 Additionally, the enhanced pre-hospital assessment of this population will facilitate appropriate timely disposition of those patients not found to have acute cardiovascular disease.

 These processes will facilitate decanting the frequently overcrowded and under resources Emergency Departments.

The purpose of this study is to determine if early diagnosis and risk stratification acquired through pre-hospital clinical assessment, 12-lead electrocardiogram and point of care biomarkers will facilitate enhanced triage and treatment in patients with presumed non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEMI).
