(fifthQuint)Osseous Healing Around 3 Types of Mandibular Implants.

 For each subject, each of the 3 implant types (B, SW, SC) were placed by the same surgeon at each of 5 mandibular surgical sites so that each site received a different implant.

 A computer generated randomised protocol known to the surgeon only at implant placement assured that each subject received the 3 implant types at 3 different surgical sites at first, followed by cyclical insertion of 2 of the 3 implant types at the remaining 2 surgical sites.

 Therefore, as much as possible, an equal number of the 3 implant types was to be randomly placed at each of the 5 different mandibular surgical sites.

 As well, this assured that 29 subjects would receive 3 implants in the left parasymphyseal area and the remaining 29 subjects would receive 3 implants in the right parasymphyseal area.

 In all, 58 subjects, 29 females received 290 mandibular implants.

 As closely as possible to the 6 month follow up date, as per accepted surgical protocol at the time, the implants were exposed.

 Healing abutments and plastic caps were placed along with a non resorbable surgical dressing.

 Subjects were then treated with a complete fixed dental prosthesis over the mandibular implants as well as a complete removable conventional dental prosthesis of the maxilla under the responsibility and supervision of a prosthodontist.

 Standardized periapical radiographs allowed quantitative measurements of the alveolar bone healing on the left and right sides of each abutment-implant junction at 12 months following prostheses insertion.

 Original measurements at 12 months of function were retaken on a sample number of subjects and inter evaluator and intra evaluator statistical analyses were performed.

 Results after 12 months of function are to be submitted.

 Following this, the present clinical study is undertaken to measure quantitative alveolar bone healing on the left and right sides of each abutment-implant junction at 15 years or more after prostheses insertion.

 Original standardized radiographic techniques and measurement protocols used at the 12 month evaluation period are and will be used to re examine as many of the original subjects as possible using present day ethical consent protocols.

 Hypothesis: The purpose of this prospective superiority trial is to test the hypothesis that an acid etched microtextured implant's surface at 1-3 mu m has a more favorable influence on quantitative osseous healing around functioning implants when compared with smoother machined implants of very similar design.

 Osseous Healing Around 3 Types of Mandibular Implants@highlight

Between 1992 and 1996, 58 subjects were enrolled in a randomised, short and long term superiority single centre prospective clinical trial.

 Each subject was randomly assigned to receive 5 mandibular endosseous implants of 3 types (B, SW, SC).

 All subjects were aged between 25 and 56 years, were in excellent physical and mental health, non smokers, not taking any prescribed medication, not suffering from TMJ or facial pain abnormalities and were treated with complete removable dental prostheses of both jaws for at least one year.

 All subjects were skeletal class I intermaxillary relationship and had at least 1 cm of bone height between the superior and inferior cortical tables as well as at least 6 mm.

 of buccal-lingual bone width in the anterior mandibular region between the mental foramina.

 All subjects had type 2 and/or type 3 mandibular bone quality in this area and specifically requested a fixed complete dental prosthesis over the mandibular implants accompanied by a conventional complete removable maxillary prosthesis.

 Standardized radiographs of the osseous healing around the abutment-implant interface were taken at 12 months after prostheses insertion and are to be taken presently and in future at 15 years or more after prostheses insertion using the same standardized protocol and equipment.

 The 3 implant types, B, SW and SC, are approved and commercially available in North America.

 They are paralleled, screw endosseous and are composed of commercially pure titanium.

 Two of the implant types are almost identical in design except that one of the implant types (SW) has an acid etched microtextured surface versus the smooth, machined non acid etched surface of the other (B).

 The third implant type (SC) possess a very similar design to the others but its smooth-surfaced collar is narrower and longer than the smooth surfaced collars of the B and SW implant types which are identical.

 The SC implant type also has an acid etched microtextured surface identical to that of the SW implant.
