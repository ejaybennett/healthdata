(thirdQuint)Long-term Study in US Cystic Fibrosis Patients Receiving Digestive Enzyme Supplements to Assess Narrowing of the Large Intestine Causing Adverse Intestinal Symptoms (Fibrosing Colonopathy).

 This is a prospective, observational, population-based cohort study in US cystic fibrosis patients participating in the Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry in order to assess the incidence of and risk factors for fibrosing colonopathy.

 Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients participating in the registry from participating sites, as well as new CF patients enrolled in the registry at these sites over a 2-year period, will serve as the base study population (estimated to include 24,500-25,000 cystic fibrosis patients between the first patient encounter documented in the registry from any participating site and the 31st of July 2014).

 Cystic fibrosis patients in the base study population will be followed at their regular clinical care visits and, any patients presenting over a 10-year period with signs and symptoms of suspected fibrosing colonopathy, based on a prospective definition, will be approached to obtain a study-specific informed consent for collection of additional data outside the standard registry data collection form in order to augment surveillance.

 Data routinely collected via the standard CF registry will be used to determine exposure to any specific pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and to assess potential risk factors for the outcome of confirmed fibrosing colonopathy.

 An independent adjudication panel will be utilized to validate the diagnosis of fibrosing colonopathy based on a prospective case definition as well as decision rules.

 Long-term Study in US Cystic Fibrosis Patients Receiving Digestive Enzyme Supplements to Assess Narrowing of the Large Intestine Causing Adverse Intestinal Symptoms (Fibrosing Colonopathy)@highlight

This is a long-term study in cystic fibrosis patients who are participating in the Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry to assess the occurrence and risk factors for a rare bowel disorder called fibrosing colonopathy (narrowing of the large intestine).

 Patients will be followed at their regular clinical care visits over a 10-year period and approached if they develop symptoms of fibrosing colonopathy for collection and use of further detailed information.
