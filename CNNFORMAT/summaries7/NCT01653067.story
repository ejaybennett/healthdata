 STORM: Temsirolimus, Rituximab and DHAP for Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma@highlight

The STORM-trial consists of two parts.

 In the part I (dose escalation of Temsirolimus) the primary objective is to establish a maximum tolerated dose of Temsirolimus in combination with Rituximab and DHAP.

 Secondary objective is to prove ability to mobilize stem cells in patients scheduled to high dose therapy.

 In the part II (full target dose) the primary objective is to evaluate the ORR in patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

 The secondary objective is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and Toxicity.
