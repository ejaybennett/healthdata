(thirdQuint)The Association Between Arterial Stiffness and Assessment of Hydration State in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.

 We evaluated 60 patients using a new BCM device that implies a validated body composition model.

 This method allows correct quantification of extracellular fluid overload or deficiency (normal limits:-1.

1 to +1.

1L).

 Patients were assigned to normo and hypervolemic groups according to BCM results.

 Also, normalized calf resistivity (nRho) was calculated from resistance at 5 Khz using c-BI and the levels of NT-proBNP were measured in all study patients.

 The analyses of arterial stiffness were performed by using the pulse wave velocity (PWV) technique on the patients.

 All patients underwent conventional echocardiography and their left ventricular diastolic functions were evaluated.

 The Association Between Arterial Stiffness and Assessment of Hydration State in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients@highlight

Dry weight (DW) assessment is essential for the efficient treatment of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients but so far objective methods for DW assessment have not been established for daily clinical practice.

 Our aim was to evaluate hydration state in PD patients by using a body composition monitor (BCM) and calf bioimpedance (c-BI) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and to compare both methods with arterial stiffness.
