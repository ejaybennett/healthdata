(secondQuint)Measure Cardiac Output Using Ultrasound Dilution in Mechanically Ventilated Children.

 The thermodilution technique with a pulmonary artery catheter has been the standard in adult patients for cardiac output measurement.

 However, using pulmonary artery catheter remains a major clinical problem in children due to technical and size constraints.

 COstatus measures changes in blood ultrasound velocity in an extracorporeal AV loop caused by body-temperature isotonic saline injected into the central vein and calculates cardiac output derived from a dilution curve.

 Measure Cardiac Output Using Ultrasound Dilution in Mechanically Ventilated Children@highlight

The measurement of cardiac output (CO) and hemodynamic pressures are vital for proper management of severely hemodynamic compromised patients.

 A new ultrasound dilution method (COstatus) for cardiac output measurement has been developed.
