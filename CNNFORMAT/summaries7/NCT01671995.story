(secondQuint)Optimising Congestive Heart Failure Outpatient Clinic Project.

 Patients 60 years of age or more hospitalized with heart failure according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.

45) are investigated before discharge and than randomized to the nurse monitored management program or to standard care.

 Examinations are performed at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months, and include clinical signs and symptoms, quality of life, biochemical assessment, echocardiography and drugs used.

 The study will be completed when all patients have passed the 18 month follow up examination.

 Quality of life is assessed by the Nottingham health profile.
