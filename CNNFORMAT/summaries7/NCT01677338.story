(secondQuint)Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Preliminary Performance of the C13-URA Breath Test Kit in Dyspeptic Subjects.

 Approximately equal numbers of subjects will be enrolled in each of the 2 groups (with normal gastric emptying, and with delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis)) to complete at least 10 subjects per group.

 The subjects will first have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy using the Solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid at Visit 1.

 Second, the subjects will have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy and 13C-uracil GEBT simultaneously using the Semi solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid and 100 mg of 13C-uracil, respectively, at Visit 2.

 A comparison will be made between the results obtained at Visits 1 and 2 along with a comparison of the data obtained during Visit 2 for evaluation of the 13C-uracil GEBT.

 Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Preliminary Performance of the C13-URA Breath Test Kit in Dyspeptic Subjects@highlight

This study is a multi-center, open-label comparison study and aimed to evaluate the preliminary performance of this 13C-uracil GEBT to examine its abilities of identifying abnormal (delayed) gastric emptying rates in subjects.
