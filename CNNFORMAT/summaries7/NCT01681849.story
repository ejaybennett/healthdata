(thirdQuint)Neural Circuits in Women With Abuse and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

 The main purpose of this study was to look at the effects of paroxetine on PTSD symptoms and brain function in women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse.

 Participants underwent baseline assessment with of PTSD symptoms measured with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and brain function during exposure to traumatic scripts of childhood abuse.

 Participants then were treated in a randomized double-blind fashion with paroxetine or placebo for three months, followed by a repeat of these assessments.

 Specific Aims of this proposal were therefore to: - Assess the effects of paroxetine on PTSD symptoms - Assess the effects of paroxetine on brain function in conjunction with exposure to traumatic scripts using positron emission tomography (PET) with O-15 water.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the medication paroxetine on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the brain in women with a history of PTSD related to childhood abuse.

 The hypothesis is that paroxetine will result in an improvement in PTSD symptoms accompanied by changes in brain functional response to reminders of childhood trauma.
