(secondQuint)Effect of Exercise as Non-surgical Treatments on Time to Total Hip Replacement Surgery.

 Hip replacements are performed at an increasing rate, also in younger and less disabled patients.

 Recent studies indicate non-surgical interventions being effective in reducing pain and disability also at later stages of disease when hip replacement is considered.

 Possible, non-surgical treatments can be used to postpone hip replacement.

 The effect of education and supervised exercise on time to hip replacement is largely unknown.

The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that patients with severe hip osteoarthritis postpone time to hip replacement surgery following participation in a patient education and supervised exercise program when compared to patients receiving patient education alone.
