(secondQuint)NOLAN: Naproxen or Loratadine and Neulasta.

 In this study, the investigational products are naproxen, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), and loratadine, an anti-histamine.

 Both agents are being investigated as prophylactic medications to reduce the incidence and/or severity of bone pain in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim prophylaxis.

 Pegfilgrastim treatment is used to stimulate bone marrow to produce more neutrophils to help fight infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
