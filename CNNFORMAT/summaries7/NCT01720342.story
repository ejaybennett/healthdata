(firstQuint)Enable Aortic Sutureless Bioprosthesis Evaluation.

 The EASE Enable study is intended to characterize the clinical performance of the Medtronic Enable(R) aortic bioprosthesis in a post-market real-world setting.

 This is a Non-randomized, prospective, non-interventional multi-center post-market release (PMR) study.

 Up to 800 subjects will be enrolled at up to 40 centers in Europe.

 After aortic valve replacement with the Enable(R) aortic bioprosthesis, each patient will have routine follow-up visits at the following intervals: at 30 days post-implant (at 30 days post-implant or prior to hospital discharge, whatever comes first), within 6 months following implantation, 1 year and annually thereafter up to 5 years post-implant.
