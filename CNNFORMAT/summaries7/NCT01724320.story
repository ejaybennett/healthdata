(firstQuint)A Phase I, First-in-man Study of OTX008 Given Subcutaneously as a Single Agent to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Overexpression of galectin-1 protein is well documented in different types of cancers, with associated bad prognostic and enhanced metastases spreading.

 In-vitro/in-vivo preclinical studies showed that OTX008 inhibits galectin-1 expression.

 In different cancer models in animals, OTX008 reduced tumor growing and metastases spreading and it was observed a blood vessels architecture normalization.

 Thus, OTX008 appears to be an innovating approach to treat cancers and this clinical phase I study aims to evaluate OTX008 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
