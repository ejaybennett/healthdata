(thirdQuint)The Effect of Whole Grain on Gut Microbiome and Metabolic Health.

 The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period.

 A total number of 60 participants will be included.

 Participants consume, in randomized order, a diet rich in whole grain in the active treatment period and a refined grain diet during the control period.

 Measurements: Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by means of a meal challenge test and by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) which is the primary outcome of this study.

 Secondary outcomes include metabolic and inflammatory markers, appetite hormones, transit time, and GM composition.

 Furthermore, selected control measures are included; 4-day food records and a study intervention diary.
