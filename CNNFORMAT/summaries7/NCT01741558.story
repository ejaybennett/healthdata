(secondQuint)The Effects of mETHotrexate Therapy on ST Segment Elevation MYocardial InfarctionS (TETHYS Trial).

 Atherosclerosis and ischemic disease have clear association with inflammation.

 There is an anti-inflammatory action of methotrexate by increasing adenosine.

 Experimental studies demonstrate reduction of infarct induced in animals treated with methotrexate.

 We expect a reduction in the area under the curve of creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) and Troponin I high sensitive, decreased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction.

 The Effects of mETHotrexate Therapy on ST Segment Elevation MYocardial InfarctionS (TETHYS Trial)@highlight

Experimental studies suggest that anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs could reduce the inflammatory profile in acute ischemic disease and reduce the area of ischemia.

 Methotrexate is a drug that has shown promise in ischemic disease in animal studies.
