(secondQuint)Trial of Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Techniques.

 Consecutive patients with suspected malignant peribronchial masses or lymph nodes undergoing endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) will be enrolled.

 All participants will have 4 needle aspirations of each targeted peribronchial lesion.

 Two needle aspirations will be performed while applying suction and 2 needle aspirations will be performed without applying suction in random order.

 The investigators will compare the diagnostic yield and the quality of the specimens obtained using the two techniques.

 Trial of Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Techniques@highlight

Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) techniques have not been well studied.

 The investigators will conduct a randomized study comparing the diagnostic yield and specimen quality of EBUS-FNA performed with and without suction applied.
