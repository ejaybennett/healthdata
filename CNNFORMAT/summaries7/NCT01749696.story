(firstQuint)Alterations in Connective Tissue in Patients With or Without Pelvic Organ Prolapse.

 The tissue samples were taken from the anterior wall of vagina in the midline close to cervix or apex.

 The tissue samples were collected from the vaginal wall of the patients with pelvic organ prolapse (n=39) during vaginal prolapse surgery.

 Control samples (n=39) were taken from patients after vaginal or laparoscopic removal of the uterus.

 The formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples were stained with Verhoeff van Gieson and Movat's pentachrome.

 Samples were examined by pathologist and gynecologist blinded as to the other investigator and to the pelvic organ prolapse status.

 In case of discrepancy investigators evaluated the samples together to gain consensus.
