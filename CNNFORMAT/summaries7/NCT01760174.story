(thirdQuint)Comparing the Effect of TAP-catheter and Epidural Catheter on Postoperative Pain After Open Gynecologic Surgery.

 Patients for open gynecologic surgery will all receive both an epidural catheter and bilateral transversus abdominis plane (:TAP) catheters.

 After randomization in to two groups the patients receive either 1) intermittent boluses of ropivacaine in the TAP-catheters and isotonic potassium chloride-infusion i the epidural catheters or 2) intermittent isotonic potassium chloride-boluses i the TAP-catheters and bupivacain-infusion in the epidural catheters.

 The investigators record pain-score and consumption of opioids in the first 24 hours postoperatively as well as thermoanalgesia at dermatome-levels th10-th12.

 The investigators assume that the effect on postoperative pain after open gynecologic surgery is equal in the two groups.

 Comparing the Effect of TAP-catheter and Epidural Catheter on Postoperative Pain After Open Gynecologic Surgery@highlight

This study compares the effect on postoperative pain of bolus administration of ropivacaine in Transversus abdominis plane catheter and continuous bupivacain-infusion in epidural catheters following open gynecologic surgery.

The study is double blind.

 The hypothesis is that the effect of the two modes of pain treatment are equal.
