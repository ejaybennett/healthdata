(firstQuint)Impact of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Language Functions in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

 Previous studies showed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can have beneficial effects on word-retrieval in healthy younger and older subjects.

 The present study aims to extend these findings by assessing whether atDCS can also improve known impairments of word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

 atDCS will be applied to the left inferior frontal gyrus in a sham controlled cross-over within subjects design.

 Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will assess underlying neural effects of the stimulation.

The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive electrical brain stimulation can improve word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
