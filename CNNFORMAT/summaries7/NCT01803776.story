(fifthQuint)Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children Study.

 The study population is a population sample of 512 children from the city of Kuopio, Finland.

 The children will be recruited at the age of 6-8 years and allocated into the intervention group and the control group.

 The intervention group will undergo intensive, individualized and family-based physical activity and diet intervention that also includes exercise and cooking clubs.

 All children will be examined after the 2-year follow-up.

 The intervention group will continues with a less intensive exercise and diet intervention until adulthood.

 All children will be re-examined in adolescence and in early adulthood.

 The results of the PANIC Study will help in improving children's health by increased physical activity and improved nutrition, in identifying high-risk children who would benefit most from exercise and diet intervention, and in targeting the high-risk children for more careful health examinations, exercise and diet intervention and health follow-up and in preventing chronic diseases and their societal consequences in adulthood.
