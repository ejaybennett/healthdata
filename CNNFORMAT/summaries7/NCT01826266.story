(thirdQuint)Effects of a Double-Blind, Single Dose of PER977 Administered Alone, and Following a Single Dose of Edoxaban.

 Normal subjects will be dosed with PER977 or placebo alone and 1 week later, they will be given a single dose of edoxaban followed in 3 hours by a single IV dose of PER977.

 The purpose is to show safety and tolerability of PER977 alone and when combined with a NOAC (edoxaban).

 The study will also provide some insight into the doses that may be required to reverse a steady state edoxaban.

 Effects of a Double-Blind, Single Dose of PER977 Administered Alone, and Following a Single Dose of Edoxaban@highlight

PER977 monotherapy and co-administration following 60 mg edoxaban will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with no impact on pro-coagulant biomarkers.

 A dose of PER977 that reverses the effects of edoxaban on the pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers (point of care prothrombin time [PoC-PT]), and/or secondary biomarkers (thromboelastography reaction time [TEG-R]) will be identified.
