(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Celecoxib and Pregabalin Compared With Celecoxib Monotherapy, in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain Having a Neuropathic Component.

 The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant use of pregabalin and celecoxib compared with celecoxib monotherapy for the symptomatic relief of pain in patients with chronic low back pain with a probable neuropathic component.

 The secondary objectives are: - Demonstrate the additional benefit of adding pregabalin to celecoxib monotherapy.

 - To evaluate the concomitant use of pregabalin and celecoxib compared to celecoxib monotherapy in a set of patient reported measures (sleep, depression, anxiety, impact of pain in daily functions, patient's global impression of change and patient's perception of the treatment).

 - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of celecoxib and of the concomitant administration of pregabalin and celecoxib.
