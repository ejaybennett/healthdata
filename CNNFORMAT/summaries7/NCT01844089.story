(fifthQuint)The Use of the Bakri Postpartum Balloon in the Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage Refractory to Conservative Measures.

 Phase I: Development and training of staff in standardized algorithm for management of PPH using available local resources (not including Bakri balloon).

 Phase II: Data collection after introduction of the standardized algorithm.

 Phase III: Revision of protocol to include the Bakri Postpartum Device Phase IV: Data collection after introduction of the Bakri device Bakri Postpartum Balloon 510K Premarket Notification/Cook OBGYN #K062438.

 The Use of the Bakri Postpartum Balloon in the Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage Refractory to Conservative Measures@highlight

The broad objective of the study is to determine if the Bakri Postpartum Balloon is effective in preventing morbidity and mortality from postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) as part of a standardized management algorithm.

 Specific Objectives - To estimate the rate of morbidity (including operative intervention and peripartum hysterectomy) and mortality secondary to PPH in 4 academic centers after introduction of a standardized protocol for management of PPH, but prior to the inclusion of the Bakri Postpartum Balloon as part of the protocol.

 - To estimate the rate of morbidity (including operative intervention and peripartum hysterectomy) and mortality secondary to PPH in 4 academic centers after introduction of a standardized protocol for management of PPH, after the inclusion of the Bakri Postpartum Balloon as part of the protocol.

 - To compare morbidity - To generate preliminary data for (a) a larger confirmatory study of the use of the Bakri Postpartum Balloon in centers with surgical and blood transfusion services, and (b) design of a pilot study of the use of the Bakri device of temporary control of PPH in settings outside of surgical centers (such as by trained midwives or emergency transport personnel).
