(firstQuint)Percutaneous Image Guided Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) Resection of Lung Lesions.

 This is a phase II protocol to determine the safety and feasibility of image guided CT marking for resection of small lung nodules.

 This is relevant because many such nodules are hard to localize for minimally invasive lung resection.

 It is hoped that this technology using fluoro CT capability available now in most operating room will improve safety and reliability of thoracic surgery.
