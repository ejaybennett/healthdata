(secondQuint)School-Based Mental Health Program Implementation in Uganda.

 Participating schools are randomly assigned to a 6-month long school-based intervention or to a wait-list control group.

 The intervention focuses on improving teacher's classroom behavioral management practices, parent engagement, and child mental health knowledge.

 Teachers are assessed at the beginning and the end of the study, and again after 6 months of intervention.

 Teachers' parent engagement, mental health knowledge, and behavioral practices in the classroom are assessed through observations and teacher ratings.
