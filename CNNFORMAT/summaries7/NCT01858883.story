(firstQuint)Safety Study of Itacitinib (INCB039110) in Combination With Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Study Part 1: This is a dose optimization phase designed to find a tolerated regimen that includes identifying the MTD of itacitinib (INCB039110) (within a defined pharmacologic range) in combination with doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel that have established safety and tolerability in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

 Study Part 2 and Part 2A: This phase will explore the safety and tolerability of the MTD or PAD of itacitinib (INCB039110) when administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with untreated advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
