(firstQuint)Use of Caudal Anesthesia Supplemented With Morphine in Children Undergoing Renal Surgery.

 The kidney surgery is a significant part of surgical armamentarium in pediatric urology.

 The common operations are open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty, partial nephrectomy open and laparoscopic and laparoscopic nephrectomy.

 One of the main goals in the postoperative period is to provide a painless recovery following by early mobilization of the child and early discharge home.

 Caudal anesthesia has become a gold standard in the renal surgery providing painless postoperative period, allowing earlier child feeding and speedy recovery.

 However some researchers have pointed out that caudal anesthesia with supplemented with Marcaine may provide painless postoperative period only for a very limited period of time and required additional painkiller therapy during postoperative period.

 Caudal anesthesia supplemented with Morphine has demonstrated their benefits in children who undergo infraumbilical surgery.
