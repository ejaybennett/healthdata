(fifthQuint)Risk-Adapted Focal Proton Beam Radiation and/or Surgery in Patients With Low, Intermediate and High Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma Receiving Standard or Intensified Chemotherapy.

 Participants will be stratified based on both a pretreatment staging system and a post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system.

 Treatment for low-risk (subset 1) participants will consist of chemotherapy and radiation.

 Low-risk (subset 2) and intermediate-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation and/or undergo surgery to destroy/remove the tumor.

 Intermediate-risk participants will also receive 16 weeks of maintenance chemotherapy.

 High-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

 High-risk participants will also receive additional maintenance therapy with anti-angiogenic chemotherapy.

 Risk-Adapted Focal Proton Beam Radiation and/or Surgery in Patients With Low, Intermediate and High Risk Rhabdomyosarcoma Receiving Standard or Intensified Chemotherapy@highlight

This study will treat participants with newly diagnosed, low, intermediate and high risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) using multi-modality risk-adapted therapy with standard or intensified dose chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection.

 Intermediate and high risk participants will receive an additional 12 weeks (4 cycles) of maintenance therapy with anti-angiogenic chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: - Estimate event-free survival for intermediate risk participants treated with vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide with the addition of maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the false negative rate and incidence of additional positive lymph nodes in participants undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by limited nodal dissection.

 - Maintain a high local control rate in participants treated with surgery and/or limited volume proton and photon radiation without dose escalation.

 - Define the incidence and type of failure in participants who receive risk-adapted local therapy relative to the primary tumor volume.

 - Establish the feasibility of delivering 4 cycles of maintenance anti-angiogenic chemotherapy in intermediate and high risk patients following standard chemotherapy.

 - Estimate the event free survival for high risk patients receiving interval dose compressed therapy and maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy.

 - Define the incidence of CTC grade 3 and higher toxicities (and specific grade 1-2 toxicities) related to proton beam therapy.
