(fifthQuint)Continuous Preperitoneal Infusion of Ropivacaine After Open Liver Resection: Effect on Post-operative Recovery and Morbidity.

.

 This study is a prospective, double blind, randomized study.

 Subjects will be randomized using a computer-generated table of random numbers into 2 groups.

 The patients scheduled to undergo open liver resection will be randomly allocated to receive a continuous wound infusion of either 0.

2% ropivacaine (ropivacaine group A) or 0.

9% saline (control group B).

 The patients will be thereafter randomly assigned to receive through the catheter either 0.

2% ropivacaine (study group) (10-ml bolus followed by an infusion of 10 ml/h during 48 h) or the same protocol with 0.

9% NaCl (control group), thanks to a elastomeric pump (500ml), set to deliver a 10-ml/h connected with the catheter.

 In addition, all patients will receive patient-controlled intravenous morphine analgesia.

 The primary endpoint : the opioid-related symptom distress scale (SDS) will be performed at 48 hours after surgery.

 Secondary endpoints will be pain intensity on a visual analog scale at rest, and on coughing, morphine consumption, respiratory dysfunction, transit recovery and side effects at 48 hours, 5 days after surgery.

 Continuous Preperitoneal Infusion of Ropivacaine After Open Liver Resection: Effect on Post-operative Recovery and Morbidity.

@highlight

Intravenous morphine Patient-Controlled analgesia is gold standard on post - operative liver resection.

 But, opioids tend to be ineffective for pain that is associated with movement and have significant short-term side effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, constipation, urinary, retention, and respiratory depression, which are factors that often hinder a patient's recovery.

 Prospective randomized trials has found continuous wound catheter analgesia as an accepted alternative to IV morphine PCA.

 The researchers will investigate whether ropivacaine, administered through a wound catheter placed by the surgeon, will reduce morbidity and provide a better recovery.
