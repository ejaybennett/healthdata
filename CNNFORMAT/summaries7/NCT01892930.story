(secondQuint)Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Undergoing Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the impact of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on the immune system in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess changes in immune parameters prior to radiation, post radiation and post nephrectomy.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess surgical parameters for partial or radical nephrectomy post SBRT.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and undergo partial or radical nephrectomy on day 29.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Undergoing Surgery@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer undergoing surgery.

 Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.
