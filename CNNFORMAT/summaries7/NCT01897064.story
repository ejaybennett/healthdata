(thirdQuint)The Influence of Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Functioning in Schizophrenia.

.

 Individuals with schizophrenia often display cognitive difficulties.

 Studies among non-clinical populations suggest that Aerobic Exercise (AE) training is effective in increasing both aerobic fitness and cognitive functioning.

 However, these associations have not been studied among individuals with schizophrenia, despite the presence of highly sedentary lifestyle in this population To elucidate this putative link, the present study will evaluate the influence of AE on cognitive functioning and daily functioning in individuals with schizophrenia using a single-blind, randomized clinical trial.

 Outpatient individuals with schizophrenia receiving treatment will be randomly assigned to AE training or Treatment As Usual (TAU).

 Participants in the AE training will undergo a 12-week, 3 times per week, 1-hour AE sessions.

 All participants will continue their regular psychiatric and medical care.

 Assessments of neurocognitive and daily functioning abilities, along with symptom severity, and physiological and behavioral measures of aerobic fitness will be completed before and after the 12-week program.

The aim of this study is to look at the effects of Aerobic Exercise (AE) on daily and neurocognitive functioning including memory, attention, the ability to plan activities, and learn new information.

 Participants will be assigned by chance to receive regular care or exercise sessions in addition to regular care.

 This study will allow determining the potential positive influence of AE on cognitive and daily functioning in individuals with schizophrenia.
