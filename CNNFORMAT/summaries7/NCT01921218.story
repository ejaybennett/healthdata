(fifthQuint)Belatacept Therapy for the Failing Renal Allograft.

 The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the medicine belatacept (Nulojix(R)) in preventing antibodies from forming in people with a failing kidney transplant.

 Kidney transplant patients take immunosuppression medicines to prevent kidney rejection.

 When a kidney transplant begins to fail, the immunosuppression medicines are slowly weaned.

 Once dialysis is started, the immunosuppressant medicines are usually stopped.

 After immunosuppression is stopped, some people form antibodies.

 Antibodies are proteins that the immune system makes to protect against harmful foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, or foreign tissues, like a transplant.

 High levels of antibodies can make it harder to find a kidney donor for that person.

 Participants will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups.

 One group will continue taking their current immunosuppression medicines.

 The people in the treatment group will be switched to belatacept (Nulojix(R)).

 Belatacept (Nulojix(R)) is an immunosuppression medicine that is approved by the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) to prevent rejection in kidney transplant.

 Participants will stop taking calcineurin inhibitors (either cyclosporine or tacrolimus) or sirolimus but will keep taking other immunosuppression medicines like Cellcept (MMF) or azathioprine (Imuran) and prednisone.

 These medicines will be slowly weaned and will be stopped if the participant has to start dialysis.

 Participants will continue taking belatacept (Nulojix(R)), even while on dialysis.

 The study team will test both groups to see how many people in each group develop antibodies.

 Belatacept Therapy for the Failing Renal Allograft@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of belatacept (Nulojix(R)) in preventing antibody formation in patients with chronic failing kidney transplants.

 This study is a randomized study of first-time kidney transplant patients who have worsening kidney function and biopsy proven grade 2 or 3 interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA).

 Patients must be eligible to get a second transplant.

 They must have completed or be actively undergoing evaluation for re-listing for a second transplant.

 Patients will be randomized to either convert to belatacept or continue on calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy.
