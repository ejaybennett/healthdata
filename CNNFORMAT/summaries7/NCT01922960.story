(firstQuint)Microcirculatory Assessment in Patients With Trauma and Severe Burns.

 Microvascular alterations are frequently seen in patients with sepsis, trauma, burns and those who are hemodynamically uncompensated(Shock).

 The use of the Microscan is a non-invasive approach to visualize and assess impaired mucosal microcirculation in order to identify early on patients who are predisposed for MOF (multiple organ failure).
