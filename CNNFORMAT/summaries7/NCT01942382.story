(thirdQuint)A Clinical Pharmacology Study of JNS010 (Paliperidone Palmitate) in Patients With Schizophrenia.

 This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study.

 Approximately, 60 participants will be enrolled in the study.

 This study will consist of a screening phase (maximum 14 days), an observation phase (92 days), and a follow-up phase (98 days).

 Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment group A, B, or C.

 During the observation phase, participants will receive injections of paliperidone palmitate of concentration ranging from 75 to 150 milligram equivalents in the deltoid muscle or gluteal muscle as applicable on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64 alternating between sides (left/right).

 Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, injection site reaction, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms scale, and visual analog scale which will be evaluated throughout the study.

 The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 190 days.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) and safety of paliperidone palmitate ranging from 75 to 150 milligram equivalents in repeated doses (4 injections) administered in the deltoid muscle (muscle in the shoulder) or gluteal muscle (group of muscles present in the buttocks) in participants with schizophrenia.
