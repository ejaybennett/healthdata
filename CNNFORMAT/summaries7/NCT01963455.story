(firstQuint)Autologous Muscle Derived Stem Cells Transplantation in Urine Incontinency.

 The investigators will be assessed the 12-month safety and potential efficacy of autologous muscle derived cells as therapy for stress urinary incontinence.

 A total of 10 women in whom stress urinary incontinence had not improved underwent intra-sphincter injection of low doses 30*106 of autologous muscle derived cells, which will be derived from biopsies of their deltoid muscle.

 Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell injection.

 Changes in stress urinary incontinence severity were evaluated by pad test, diary of incontinence episodes and quality of life surveys.
