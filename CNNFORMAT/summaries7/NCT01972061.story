(firstQuint)Foot/Hand Neuromodulation for Overactive Bladder (OAB).

 Foot neuromodulation is designed to treat OAB conditions by electrically stimulating the somatic afferent nerves in the foot using skin surface electrodes.

 The foot stimulation is non-invasive, can be performed at home, and has no adverse effects.

 Foot neuromodulation therapy will likely be accepted by more patients and have the potential to make a broader impact on the improvement of OAB conditions.
