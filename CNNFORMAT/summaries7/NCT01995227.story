(fifthQuint)An Individualized Anti-Cancer Vaccine Study in Patients With HCC.

 All accrued subjects will undergo tumor harvest procedure.

 The tumor samples will be processed into personalized Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) vaccine.

 This study consists of three phases: priming phase, vaccination phase, and activation phase.

 The priming phase involves intradermal injections of AlloStim(TM).

 The aim of this phase is to increase the titer of Th1 immune cells in circulation.

 The vaccination phase involves the intradermal injections of AlloSim(TM) immediately followed by the intradermal injections of CRCL.

 This phase is designed to elicit tumor-specific immunity.

 The activation phase involves intravenous infusion of AlloStim(TM).

 This phase is designed to activate memory cells and NK cells and cause them to extravasate and traffic to tumor sites.

 An Individualized Anti-Cancer Vaccine Study in Patients With HCC@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and the immunological, radiological, and pathological response of the personalized anti-cancer vaccine AlloVax(TM) in patients with refractory Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and who are not eligible for any approved HCC treatments or have failed all approved HCC treatments.

 AlloVax(TM) is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine combining Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) as a source of tumor antigen prepared from patient's tumor and AlloStim(TM) as an adjuvant.

 The combination of these two components provides a vaccine designed to bring out an immune response capable of finding and killing the tumor cells.
