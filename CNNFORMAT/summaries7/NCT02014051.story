(thirdQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of SyB C-1101 in Patients With Recurrent/Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

 In Cohort 1, SyB C-1101 280 mg/dose group, Participants will be administered 280 mg/dose of SyB C-1101 twice daily orally for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7-day observation period.

 In Cohort 2, SyB C-1101 560 mg/dose group, Participants will be administered 560 mg/dose of SyB C-1101 twice daily orally for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7-day observation period.

 In both Cohorts, the treatment period of 21 days constitutes 1 cycle, and the treatment was allowed for up to cycles.

 The participants received SyB C-1101 only once daily on Day 1 and Day 14 of Cycle 1 for the investigation of the pharmacokinetics.

The purpose of this study is to investigate tolerability when SyB C-1101 is orally administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days to the patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose, and to estimate the recommended dose for phase II studies.

 Pharmacokinetics and antitumor effects will also be investigated.
