(firstQuint)The Effect of General Anesthesia Immunosuppressive on Hepatitis B Virus Replication.

 The change of immune state can influence HBV replication or elimination, it has been reported that a certain degree of immunosuppression occured after general anesthesia.

 In this study we detect the cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL) count and activity, interferon-(IFN-) and HBV-DNA content form the HBV patient who will accept general anesthesia.

 Our purpose is to evaluate the influence of general anesthesia immunosuppressive on HBV replication.

 If the results show that HBV-DNA quantity increases, so the patients might be given anti-HBV drugs or immune enhancer; otherwise it is indicated the general anesthesia immunosuppressive don't influence HBV replication.
