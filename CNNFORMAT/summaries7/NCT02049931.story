(firstQuint)Comparison of Treatments of Osteoporotic Compression Fracture Using Rigid Brace, Soft Brace, and no Brace.

 Bracing has been considered as a landmark step in conservative management for osteoporotic compression fractures.

 However, no prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trials are available to document for the efficacy of wearing of the rigid or soft brace for the management of osteoporotic compression fracture.

 Therefore, the current trial was therefore designed to compare the outcome for improvement of disability and pain in patients with osteoporotic compression fracture using rigid, soft, or no brace.

The treatment outcomes in the treatment without brace would be non-inferior to those in use of rigid or soft brace.
