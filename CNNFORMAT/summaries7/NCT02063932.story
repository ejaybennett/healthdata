(firstQuint)Association Between Confocal Laser Endomicroscopic (CLE) Features and Gastric Mucosal Microbiome.

 The gastric mucosal microbiome plays a pivotal role in a series of diseases, such as the H.

pylori infection.

 We hypothesized that mucosal patterns, here visualized by confocal endomicroscopy, may constitute specific microbiome niches.
