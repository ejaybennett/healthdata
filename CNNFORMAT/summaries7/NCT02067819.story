(firstQuint)Proof of Concept Study of an Oral Orthotic to Reduce Tic Severity in Chronic Tic Disorder and Tourette Syndrome.

 The study is a 2 group, 2 week randomized controlled feasibility trial of an active vs sham oral orthotic to reduce tic severity in children and adolescents ages 7-25 years.

 Responders to acute phase treatment will be followed for 10 additional week (12 weeks total) to assess intervention durability, safety and acceptability.

 Non-responders to the sham orthotic will be provided active treatment at the end of the 2 week acute phase.

 We aim to assess and enroll 24 participants; twelve participants will receive an orthotic adjusted to the appropriate therapeutic height, and twelve participants will receive an identical sham orthotic, but not adjusted to the recommended height for the given participant.
