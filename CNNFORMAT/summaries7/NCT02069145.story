(thirdQuint)Dose Escalation Study of OMP-54F28 in Combination With Sorafenib in Patients With Hepatocellular Cancer.

 Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in this study.

 Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging nonclinical and clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy.

 The starting dose for a new dosing schedule will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that cleared on the previously studied dosing schedule.

 No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a dose cohort.

 Sorafenib 400 mg will be given orally twice daily (PO BID).

 Sorafenib dosing schedules with a total daily dose <800 mg (e.

g.

 Sorafenib 400 mg once daily) may be evaluated in this study depending on emerging safety data from this study.

 Dose Escalation Study of OMP-54F28 in Combination With Sorafenib in Patients With Hepatocellular Cancer@highlight

This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of OMP-54F28 when combined with sorafenib.

 OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

 The planned dose levels of OMP-54F28 are 5 and 10 mg/kg.

 Depending on safety in this study, additional lower or intermediate dose levels may be evaluated.
