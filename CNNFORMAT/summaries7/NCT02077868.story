(firstQuint)Evaluation of MGN1703 Maintenance Treatment in Patients With mCRC With Tumor Reduction During Induction Treatment.

 Due to the toxicity of chemotherapeutic medications treatment breaks are common practice in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

 During these treatment breaks a variety of maintenance treatments are available.

 MGN1703 is developed not only to help the Patient to recover from chemotherapy but also to boost the patient's immune System and thus help him to effectively fight the Tumor himself.

 After the concept has already been proved in a previous study this Trial is conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGN1703 Treatment.
