(thirdQuint)Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) + Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b and Pembrolizumab+ Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma or Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-029/KEYNOTE-29).

 The trial is being done in three parts: Part 1A (MEL and RCC) will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) for the drug combinations; a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each combination will be identified.

 Part 1B (MEL-single arm expansion) will better characterize safety and efficacy and provide preliminary efficacy data for the penbrolizumab + IPI combination in participants with MEL.

 Part 2 (MEL and RCC) is a randomized portion of the trial and will evaluate preliminary efficacy of the drug combinations given in 6-week cycles for advanced MEL participants.

 Part 2 was removed from the study with Amendment 3 of the protocol.

 Part 1C (MEL) is added as the third part of the study with Amendment 3.

 Part 1C will evaluate safety and efficacy for different doses and dosing intervals for IPI in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced MEL.

 Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) + Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b and Pembrolizumab+ Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma or Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-029/KEYNOTE-29)@highlight

This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment for advanced melanoma (MEL) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using combination regimens of pembrolizumab + pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and pembrolizumab + ipilimumab (IPI).

 The primary hypothesis is that these combinations will be sufficiently well-tolerated to permit continued clinical investigation.
