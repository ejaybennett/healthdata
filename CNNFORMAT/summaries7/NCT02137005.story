(fifthQuint)Cerebral Palsy Adult Transition Longitudinal Study.

 The investigators are proposing a prospective, longitudinal, cross-sectional, and patient-centered outcome study of walking ability and current health status to investigate important health outcomes that impact the quality of life, participation, and activity on adults with cerebral palsy who took part in a gait analysis during childhood at the Center for Gait and Movement Analysis (CGMA).

 The goal is to see whether their health and walking ability has changed since leaving the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) system and understand if there is a relationship between maintaining proper walking ability and health status.

 The investigators are including the measure of health outcomes to better understand if a decline in walking ability relates to a decline in health status.

 The first aim is to study the walking ability of adults with cerebral palsy by comparing their results of a gait analysis to the same results collected when they were children.

 The second aim is to study the presence of heart disease risk factors by testing each participant's blood levels of lipids, glucose, and insulin.

 The investigators will also measure each participant's blood pressure.

 The third aim is to study the relationship(s) between inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factors, and pain and fatigue levels.

 The investigators will measure inflammatory markers through a blood test and pain and fatigue levels through standardized assessments.

 The fourth aim is to study each participant's mental health.

 The investigators will measure this through standardized psychological assessments.

 The fifth aim is to study each participant's self-perceived health and quality of life as well as employment status.

 The investigators will measure these levels also through standardized assessments.

 Cerebral Palsy Adult Transition Longitudinal Study@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate longitudinally, the walking ability of individuals with cerebral palsy who are transitioning into adulthood and to cross-sectionally examine the health status of these individuals in the context of their walking ability.

 Young adults who received instrumented gait analysis (IGA) as children will show significant decreases in overall gait performance, as measured by kinematics, kinetics, temporal-spatial parameters, and gait deviation index, compared to their last childhood IGA.
