(fifthQuint)A Public Health Program to Reduce Risk of Antepartum Depression.

 We collected data using Netbooks computers pre-programmed with Qualtrics survey forms.

 At baseline (T1), post intervention (T2) and 1-month follow-up (T3), participants were administered the EPDS and the BDI-II and the Dolphin MINI neuropsychiatric Interview version 6.

 A similar time frame was used for the TAU group.

 Paired T-tests were used to determine mean change in EPDS scores (primary analysis) and BDI-II scores (secondary analysis) within each of the CBI and TAU groups at T2 and T3.

 A T-test measured differences in EPDS and BDI-II scores for the same time periods.

 - The sample size was based on the PI's pilot intervention study.

 Using a conservative estimate of 500 eligible women from both sites per year at a 42% depression risk rate (moderate and high), and a 46% enrollment rate, it will be possible to accrue 97 subjects per year at risk for APD (moderate and high risk) or 193 subjects over the first 24 months of the study.

 Using the recruitment, retention, and eligibility patterns from the previous study, a total study sample of 124 subjects, 62 in the IP-CBI group and 62 in the TAU control group, allows for a 20% (24) drop-out rate and achieve the goal of 50 women in the IP-CBI and 50 women in the TAU control group.

 - We planned to determine if there were significant differences in EPDS baseline scores in the CBI and TAU groups for the full sample and for the CBI and TAU groups stratified by high or low-moderate risk for antepartum depression.

The hypotheses were as follows: H1.

 Women at low-moderate risk for APD at T1 (baseline EPDS scores of 5-9) in the cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) group will maintain low-moderate risk status and have significantly fewer APD symptoms at T2 and T3 than women at low-moderate risk for APD in the (TAU) control group (as measured by percent of participants with EPDS scores 10) in the CBI group will have a significantly greater reduction in APD symptoms at T2 and T3 than women at high risk for APD in the TAU control group (as measured by percent of participants with EPDS scores <10 at T2 and T3 and mean score changes).
