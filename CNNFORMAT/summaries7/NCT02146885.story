(thirdQuint)The Use of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to Characterize in Response to Weight-Loss Intervention.

 Optical technologies under development at the Beckman Laser Institute.

 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging is a method for studying absorption and scattering (optical properties) of tissue in humans.

 It is related to near-infrared spectroscopy , but allows for more quantitative and thorough measurements.

 The researcher use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to measure fatty tissue, water, blood concentration level during weight loss program to determine the effect of sustained changes in weight or relapses.

 The Use of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to Characterize in Response to Weight-Loss Intervention@highlight

The first step in any clinical intervention against obesity involves sustained lifestyle changes.

 Researcher can use these strategies to beneficial the effects of weight and on cardiovascular risk.

 The researcher develope methods for assessing the effectiveness use optical technology to make such assessments, specifically in the area of fatty tissue can predict the effectiveness of the intervention in causing weight reduction and treating metabolic disease.
