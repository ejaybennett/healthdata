(secondQuint)A Prospective Observational Study to Assess Insulin Delivery With PaQ in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

 This is a prospective, single center, post-market observational study to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes of insulin delivery with PaQ(R) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin therapy with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control.

 The patient's participation in the study is comprised of three phases: screening/baseline evaluation, transition to PaQ use and optimization, and PaQ treatment period.

 The use of these phases will allow an orderly transition to PaQ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret the final data.
