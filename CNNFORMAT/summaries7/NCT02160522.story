(firstQuint)Endotracheal Tube (ETT) Cuff Pressure Study in the Emergency Department (ED).

 Although manometers are available for the purpose of measuring ETT intra-cuff pressures, they are not currently in use at our institution's Emergency Department.

 This prospective cohort study will endeavor to determine the incidence of unacceptably high ETT cuff pressures in the ED, laying the foundation for follow up studies on patient outcomes and the potential need for more careful management of intra-cuff pressures in the ED.
