(firstQuint)Laparoscopic Myomectomy Using Barbed or Conventional Sutures.

 - Uterine leiomayomas are the most common pelvic tumors in women.

 About 25% of uterine fibroids causes symptoms such as bleeding , pain ,infertility , recurrent abortion and pelvic pressure symptoms .

 Surgery is the main line of treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

 Hysterectomy is the typical management for patients who do not desire fertility .

Myomectomy is usually considered in patients who desire future fertility or decline hysterectomy .

 Myomectomy has been traditionally performed by laparotomy.

 During the past few decades , laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, and robotic myomectomy have largely replaced open myomectomy .

 - A recent meta-analysis revealed that laparoscopic myomectomy was associated with less hemoglobin drop, reduced operative blood loss, diminished postoperative pain and fewer overall complications.

 On the other , the operative time was significantly longer with laparoscopic myomectomy .

 The main difficulties encountered during laparoscopy that causes prolongation of operative time are difficulties in knot tying and difficulties in maintaining adequate tension of the suture line .

 - Recently, barbed suturing systems were used in gynecologic surgery .

 In barbed suturing systems , delayed-absorbable or non-absorbable material is interrupted with barbs that prevent slippage through tissues and is used to suture tissues without knots.

 With the barbed sutures , the wound tension is evenly distributed across the length of the filament rather than at the knots at the end of the suture.

 The absence of knots and the uniform tension of the thread on tissues lead to less ischemic damage, with subsequent reduction of pain and adhesions .

 - A retrospective study comparing the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic myomectomy using a bidirectional barbed suture (107 patients) with those of laparoscopic myomectomy using conventional smooth suture (31 patients) revealed that the use of bidirectional barbed suture was found to significantly shorten the duration of surgery and reduce the duration of hospital stay.

 - Till now , there is only one small randomized controllrd study (n=22 in each arm) which compared the use of barbed suture with conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy .

The myoma bed was closed with either conventional polyglactin suture or unidirectional barbed suture .

 The operative time was shorter in the barbed suture group (73.

 However, the time required to suture the myoma beds was significantly lower in the barbed suture group .

The aim of this study is to compare operative data and early postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic myomectomy using barbed sutures with those of laparoscopic myomectomy using conventional sutures .
