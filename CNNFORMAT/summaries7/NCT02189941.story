(thirdQuint)Pilot Study of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Deferiprone Sustained-Release Formulation in Healthy Volunteers.

 This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-way crossover study under fed and fasting conditions designed to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of deferiprone sustained-release tablets in healthy volunteers.

 Subjects were randomized to receive the following 3 treatments in different orders, with a washout period of 7 days between treatments: - 2000 mg of deferiprone sustained-release tablets under fed conditions - 2000 mg of deferiprone sustained-release tablets under fasted conditions - 2000 mg of Ferriprox immediate-release tablets under fasted conditions In each period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment were collected prior to dosing and at specified time points up to 24 hours post-dose.

 Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study.

 Pilot Study of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Deferiprone Sustained-Release Formulation in Healthy Volunteers@highlight

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of the sustained-release formulation of deferiprone under both fasting and fed conditions, and evaluate the relative bioavailability of this sustained-release formulation when compared to immediate-release formulation of deferiprone under fasting conditions.
