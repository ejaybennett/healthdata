(fifthQuint)Step-up to Quit: Using Low-to-moderate Intensity Exercise for Reducing Smoking Cue Reactivity Among Low-income Smokers.

 Tobacco use and lack of physical activity (PA) are preventable health behaviors contributing to disproportionate rates of morbidity/mortality (MM) among low income underserved adults.

 Comprehensive interventions incorporating treatment of multiple risk behaviors can have immense public health impact.

 The goal of this study is to improve uptake of PA during the pre-quit period by promoting low to moderate intensity PA (LMPA/walking) during the pre-quit preparatory period to promote smoking cessation among low-income sedentary smokers.

 Eligible participants (sedentary, >5 cigs/day) will be randomized to 8-week LMPA vs.

 standard of care (SCC) intervention.

 LMPA group intervention focuses on (a) increasing daily steps using a tailored algorithm with a goal of reaching 10,000 steps/day by Week 4 (quit day) and (b) integrates PA with evidence-based smoking cessation programming by explicitly linking short bouts of PA with urge management training during the pre-quit period.

 The SCC group receives standard care smoking cessation counseling.

 Group differences in quit day reduction (extinction) of smoking urge reactivity using an analog cue-exposure paradigm, and smoking quit rates at 1-week and 1-month follow-up will be examined.

The study's primary aim is to test the hypothesis that an intervention that integrates low to moderate physical activity (walking) with evidence-based smoking cessation counseling (LMPA) will result is greater reductions in quit-day reactivity to smoking cues (a behavioral predictor of smoking relapse) as compared to standard care smoking cessation counseling (control group) in a sample of low-income sedentary male and female smokers.

 The study will also test the hypothesis that the participants randomized to the LMPA intervention will have greater quit rates at one-week and one-month post quit day follow ups.
