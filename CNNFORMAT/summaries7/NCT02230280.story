(fifthQuint)My Stroke Team (MYST): Stroke App Pilot Study.

 Research Questions: 1.

 What is the feasibility and acceptability of the MYST app within the context of a 6-month community navigation and rehabilitation intervention from the perspectives of health care providers, clients, and family caregivers? 2.

 What are the MYST app usage patterns by various subgroups of end-users (e.

g.

, clients, health-care providers, age groups of HCPs, stroke survivors and family caregivers)? 3.

 What is the effect of the intervention on stroke survivors' health-related quality of life, community re-integration, physical functioning, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and costs of use of health services, from a societal perspective? 4.

 What is the effect of the intervention on family caregivers' health-related quality of life, caregiver strain, depression, anxiety, and costs of use of health services from a societal perspective? 5.

 What is the effect of the intervention on HCP outcomes (interprofessional collaboration)? Methods: Due to the complexity of evaluating health services interventions, a mixed methods design will be used to evaluate the multi-component intervention.

 A pragmatic pre-test post-test single site study design will be used to evaluate the intervention.

 By pragmatic, the investigators mean the intervention will be implemented under real-world conditions, including reliance on existing staff at the participating site.

 Assessments will be made at baseline (pre-test) and immediately following the six-month intervention period (post-test).

 Descriptive qualitative methods will be used to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.

 Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6 months.

 Summary descriptive measures will be reported for all variables.

 Expected Outcomes: It is expected that stroke survivors with multiple chronic conditions, their family caregivers and healthcare providers will find the MYST app acceptable and feasible.

 My Stroke Team (MYST): Stroke App Pilot Study@highlight

Most stroke survivors live with other chronic health conditions that can negatively affect their recovery and overall health and well-being.

 Although stroke care has improved, there are still many challenges to the delivery of community-based stroke care.

 These challenges include: poor coordination of care across health care providers and settings; limited communication among health care providers; limited use of evidence-based treatment guidelines; difficulties navigating community services and supports; and limited client and family caregiver involvement in making healthcare decisions.

 The investigators developed a new mobile health (mHealth) application, My Stroke Team (MYST), to address these challenges to improve the overall quality of stroke care at home.

 This study will expand this work to: 1) explore the feasibility and acceptability of this mobile tool, 2) determine its impact and usability for home care providers, stroke survivors, and their family caregivers, and 3) determine its impact on the costs of use of health services.
