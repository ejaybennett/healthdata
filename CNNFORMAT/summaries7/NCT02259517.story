(fifthQuint)An fMRI Study of Stimulant vs.

 Non-Stimulant Treatment of ADHD.

 Children with ADHD and age and sex-matched healthy controls will be scanned at the beginning of the study.

 In this first part of the study, MRI findings will be compared between the two groups to see whether brain functioning of children with ADHD differs from that of healthy children.

 In the second part of the study, the children with ADHD will meet weekly with the study doctor and be administered either extended-release guanfacine (Intuniv) or lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) for 6 weeks.

 Selection into either treatment group will be randomly determined.

 At the end of the study, the children with ADHD treated with either medication will have a second MRI scan.

 The findings of that second MRI scan will be compared to the first MRI scan in order to examine brain changes due to the medication.

 These second MRI scans will also be compared to the scans of the healthy controls.

 An fMRI Study of Stimulant vs.

 Non-Stimulant Treatment of ADHD@highlight

Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are typically treated with two types of medications with differing mechanisms of action: stimulants and non-stimulants.

 The stimulant Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine, LDX), and the non-stimulant Intuniv (extended-release guanfacine, GXR), are both FDA approved treatment for ADHD.

 Clinical trials have shown that both medications are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, although the neurobiological mechanisms by which Vyvanse and Intuniv produce these effects remain unknown.

 The aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms by which LDX and GXR reduce symptoms in patients with ADHD.

 MRI scanning will be used to identify treatment-related changes in brain structure and function.
