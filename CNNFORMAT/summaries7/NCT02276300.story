(firstQuint)HER2-Peptide Vaccination of Patients With Solid Tumors.

 This is an interventional phase I clinical study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HER2-derived peptide vaccination.

 HLA-A2+ patients with stage IV metastasized breast or gastric cancer with HER2 expression (IHC Score 2+) without gene amplification proved by FISH analysis, with documented stable disease or objective response after at least first line systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy for advanced disease who have not been treated for the underlying malignant disease for 4 weeks with chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy will be included into the study.

 The aim of the study is to show safety and tolerability of this immunotherapeutic approach and to investigate efficacy of the immunotherapy.
