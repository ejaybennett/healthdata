(firstQuint)Ankle-foot Orthoses for Peripheral Artery Disease.

 The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD patients using an AFO during a graded exercise test will demonstrate a greater PWT compared to PWT assessed without the use of an AFO.

 Secondary hypotheses include evaluation of the effect of an AFO on: 1) calf muscle function, 2) claudication onset time, 3) functional ability, 4) peak oxygen consumption, and 5) patient-reported outcomes.

 We will also examine the effects of the AFO on outcomes following 12 weeks of community walking.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an ankle foot orthoses (AFO) on the primary outcome of peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
