(secondQuint)Effect of Kinesio Taping on Muscle Strength in Lower Trapezius.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of recoil tape with 0-30% tension, by using one application of Kinesio tape over the muscle fibers of the lower trapezius from its origin to its insertion.

 The participants will be divided into intervention group (taping) and control group (no intervention).

 Muscle strength test will be performed before and immediately after taping (20-30 minutes) for both groups using hand-held dynamometer measurements (MicroFET 3).

 Work is based on the following hypothesis: "Kinesio taping using recoil taping provides increased isometric muscle strength in lower trapezius immediately after application".
