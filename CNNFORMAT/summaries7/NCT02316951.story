(firstQuint)Monitoring Postoperative Pain and Recovery Following Orthopedic Surgery.

 During hospitalization, beginning after orthopedic surgery, study participants will be asked to wear a small motion detector on their wrist.

 A computer vision system which analyzes both whole-body movement as well as facial expressions will be used at the bedside to compare common signs and symptoms of post op pain to patient pain scores.

 Up to 30 study participants will be selected.

 Study participants will be asked to complete a written pain diary during waking hours.

This information will be compared to the pain scores found in the patient's medical record and/or the amount and frequency of pain medications they receive.
