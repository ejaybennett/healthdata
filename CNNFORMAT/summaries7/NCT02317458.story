(firstQuint)Congestive Heart Failure Cardiopoietic Regenerative Therapy (CHART-2) Trial - THE CHART-2 TRIAL.

 Patients with chronic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy being on standard of care will be screened per the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 Enrolled patients will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either standard of care and C3BS-CQR-1 injection (treatment group) or standard of care undergoing a sham procedure (control group).

 Patients randomized to the treatment group, for which C3BS-CQR-1 production met release criteria, will undergo endoventricular injection of the C3BS-CQR-1 using injection catheter.
