(fifthQuint)Feasibility of a Novel Technique for Pilonidal Wound Healing.

 The investigators study has 2 main goals: Aim 1: To evaluate wound healing at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively in a prospective MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix cohort Aim 2: To evaluate pilonidal recurrence, reoperation rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively in a prospective MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix cohort The investigators main hypothesis is that using MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix for postoperative wound care will significantly improve healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes.

 The null hypothesis of the study is that there is no significant difference in healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and negative pressure dressing cohorts.

 The alternative hypothesis is that there are differences in healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and negative pressure dressing cohorts.

 Twenty consecutive patients undergoing surgical excision for Pilonidal Disease will be recruited for treatment.

 All patients will undergo comparable surgical excision and application of the novel protocol.

 The wound will be left undisturbed for 10-14 days (until the 1st follow-up visit).

 At the 1st scheduled postoperative visit, the wound will reassessed in the operative suite, and a second application of the protocol may be performed at the surgeon's discretion.

 The next follow-up visits will be at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.

 At these visits, the wound bed will be measured, photo documentation will be captured, and patients will complete a survey to assess quality of life.

 Study Endpoints are: 1.

 Wound healing at 6 months.

 Success is defined at a 60% healing rate of epithelialization and wound contracture by volume measurements in centimeters.

 2.

 Observation of quality of life, total costs for treatment, recurrence and reoperation rates at 6 months.

 Feasibility of a Novel Technique for Pilonidal Wound Healing@highlight

Pilonidal disease (PD) is a chronic disease with a major impact on patient quality of life and productivity.

 Thus, wound healing would have a significant effect on patient quality outcomes, patient quality of life, and healthcare utilization, as well as societal benefits from allowing this vital population to return to productivity.

 There is no consensus on postoperative wound care after surgery for PD.

 Negative pressure therapy is commonly used.

 However, this therapy is costly and cumbersome, and not evidence-based to optimize wound healing or postoperative patient or financial outcomes.

 The investigators goal is to investigate the impact of MatriStem(R) Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix(R) (ACell, Inc.

, Columbia, MD) on pilonidal wound healing.

 Secondary goals are to evaluate the impact of MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix on postoperative outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare costs after surgical management of pilonidal disease.
