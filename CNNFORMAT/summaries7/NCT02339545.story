(fifthQuint)Coronary Flow Reserve Following Orbital Atherectomy.

 Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects over 16 million subjects in the United States, making it the most common form of heart disease.

 The American Heart Association 2010 Update on Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics reported that in 2006 an estimated 1,313,000 inpatient percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures were performed in the United Sates.

 Despite advances in interventional equipment and techniques, there are still patient populations who remain challenging to treat.

 One of those patient subsets consists of individuals with lesions that have calcium deposits.

 Up to 50% of stents deployed in calcified lesions were found to have asymmetric stent expansion.

 Research has also shown that an increased amount of calcium deposits leads to a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) when compared to non-calcified lesions.

In addition, lesion calcification has been shown to be associated with vessel dissection during PCI, failure to deliver a stent, balloon ruptures, and un-dilatable lesions.

 Unlike PTCA and stenting procedures where the calcified lesion is cracked and the stenotic lesion materials are crushed into the arterial walls, atherectomy procedures remove the stenotic lesion materials, especially the calcified portion of the lesion.

 Removing, as opposed to displacing, stenotic material may potentially lead to reduced acute vascular traumas, lessen the stimulus for neointimal hyperplasia that is commonly associated with in- stent restenosis, and facilitate stent delivery and expansion.

 Adequate plaque preparation or modification may improve both acute and long term outcomes in subjects with complex lesions, especially heavily calcified lesions.

 Measurement of coronary flow reserve (CFR) using the Volcano FloWire can assess physiological changes in the distal vascular bed.

 The primary endpoint of this study will evaluate coronary flow reserve after successful treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions using OAS and stent deployment.

 The secondary endpoint will measure the occurrence of post-procedural Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), including Cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (Q wave or non-Q wave), or target vessel revascularization.

 Coronary Flow Reserve Following Orbital Atherectomy@highlight

This is an acute, observational, prospective, multi-center clinical study to evaluate Coronary Flow Reserve using the Volcano FloWire(R) after treatment with Orbital Atherectomy and stenting of de-novo severely calcified lesions due to Coronary Artery Disease.

 15 subjects will be enrolled in up to 3 active U.

S.

 study sites.

 Subjects who undergo successful revascularization using Orbital Atherectomy and stenting will be eligible for enrollment.

 All enrolled subjects will be treated with the OAS and stenting and seen at 24 hours or at discharge, whichever is earlier.

 The purpose of the study is to evaluate coronary artery flow reserve following successful treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions with the OAS and stenting.
