(secondQuint)Effects of Acute Estrogen Therapy on Bone Formation.

 Estrogen (E) deficiency is the major cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

 Understanding the mechanisms by which E regulates bone metabolism is critical for developing novel approaches to prevent and treat this disorder.

 We will focus on defining mechanisms for the age-related decrease in bone formation and the role of E deficiency in mediating this decrease.

 We will use novel methods we have developed to examine gene expression in highly purified bone marrow osteoblastic cells.

 We will test whether the increase in bone formation previously observed following acute E treatment in women is associated with an increase in markers of Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and/or production and in othe genes related to bone formation by osteoblastic cells.

 Effects of Acute Estrogen Therapy on Bone Formation@highlight

This study is being done to study age-related bone changes in women.

 The investigators know that the major cause of osteoporosis is a shortage of the female hormone estrogen.

 This study will look closer at how this shortage of estrogen works to cause a decrease in bone formation.
