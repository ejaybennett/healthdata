(thirdQuint)Clinical Study of the TSP Crosser System for Transseptal Access and Left Atrial Catheter Navigation.

 Transseptal (TS) catheterization is a critical step for left atrial (LA) interventions (atrial fibrillation ablation, LA appendage closure, mitral valve interventions).

 The availability of suitable tools and techniques is essential to safely perform the TS puncture, effectively deliver radiofrequency lesions, deploy LA devices, and anticipate difficult procedural situations in which complications may arise.

 This study is intended to assess the safety, performance and usability of the TSP Crosser System in facilitating access to the left atrium and catheter navigation to the pulmonary veins (PV) during catheter based ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).

 Moreover, the study will assess the impact of the TSP Crosser System on procedural times, including time to achieve left atrial accesses, total procedure times, total fluoroscopy time, left atrial mapping time and radiofrequency isolation times.

 The study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized single arm interventional investigation.

 Enrolled subjects who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated during the catheter mapping and ablation procedures and followed until release from hospital post procedure per institutional standard of care.

 After 30 days, patient will be contacted by telephone to obtain information on their clinical condition and any adverse events; if necessary, a clinic visit may be performed when required by the physician.
