(thirdQuint)Multi-modality MRI Study on Prediction for Mild Cognitive Impairment Conversion.

 The cognition of MCI is between normal healthy and AD, which is thought the transitional stage of AD.

 Patients with MCI have heavy risk to convert to AD, so in this study, the investigators focus on the exploration of the characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using technology of Multi-Modality MRI, including structural MRI, functional MRI and DTI.

 Then the investigators further study the patients who convert to AD and explore their MRI characteristics on baseline, in order to construct the predictable classifier from MCI to AD.

 The investigators want to achieve the early diagnosis of AD and help clinicians interfere with the progress of this disease.

 Multi-modality MRI Study on Prediction for Mild Cognitive Impairment Conversion@highlight

The purpose of this study is to find the characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using technology of Multi-Modality MRI , including structural MRI, functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging(DTI).

 Then analyze the difference between progressive MCI (MCIp) and stable MCI (MCIs) and further construct the predictable classifier from MCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on Multi-Modality MRI characteristics of MCI patients.
