(thirdQuint)Clinical Study to Compare Various Dosing and Titration Guidelines of Insulin Delivered Via V-Go  in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Initiating Basal Bolus Therapy in Primary Care Offices.

 This study addresses the informational needs of Primary Care Physicians with regard to providing insulin dosing and titration information utilizing a V-Go disposable insulin delivery device.

 We look to compare two treatment arms of insulin dosing and titration in patients with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes - a fixed dose titration arm, and an arm where 50% of the insulin dose is given at the largest meal of the day.

 This study will provide practical information on glycemic control, dose requirements and safety in patients with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic agents who are being primarily managed in the primary care office.
