(fifthQuint)MelmarT Melanoma Margins Trial Investigating 1cm v 2cm Wide Excision Margins for Primary Cutaneous Melanoma.

 This study will determine whether there is a difference in local recurrence rates and melanoma survival rates for patients treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin for both intermediate & high risk melanomas.

 The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients.

 This study is designed to show that the risk of long-term pain associated with surgery can be halved.

 If the study shows no risk of the tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease.

 This trial will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in general.

 MelmarT Melanoma Margins Trial Investigating 1cm v 2cm Wide Excision Margins for Primary Cutaneous Melanoma@highlight

Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary lesion with a wide margin.

 There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be just as safe.

 This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of the primary lesion for adult patients with a primary invasive cutaneous melanomas >=1mm thick to determine differences in the rate of local recurrence and melanoma specific survival.

 A reduction in margins is expected to improve quality of life in patients
