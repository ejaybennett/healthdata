(thirdQuint)Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Surgery Alone for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

 The effect of Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on survival of patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas remains the most controversial part of Neo-adjuvant therapy for esophageal carcinomas.

 Therefore, the optimal management of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinomas differs widely among different areas based on local randomized controlled trials.

 The neo-adjuvant chemotherapy might be a good strategy if sufficient local control is achieved by surgical treatment.

 This study defined the detail of surgery procedure and the region of lymphadenectomy and adopted cisplatin and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.

 We try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this neo-adjuvant strategy.

 Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Surgery Alone for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma@highlight

The effect of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on survival of patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas remains the most controversial part of neo-adjuvant therapy for esophageal carcinomas.

 One of our objectives is to evaluate whether the neo-adjuvant therapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel followed by right thoracic approach esophagectomy with total 2-field lymph node dissection improves the overall survival of thoracic esophageal cancer patients.
