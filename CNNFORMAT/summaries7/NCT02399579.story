(firstQuint)Evaluation of a New Self-Assessed, Home-Based Symptom Score Test in Cat Allergic Patients.

 In order to bring research on cat dander allergy a step further we aim to investigate cat dander allergy symptoms and record them in a natural environment, respectively, i.

e.

 at the participant's home.

 For this purpose we aim to test a new self-assessed, homebased symptom score (called HypoScore).

 The participants will perform 8 provocation tests.

 Every provocation test consists of petting the cat until the participants become symptomatic.

 The participants have to pet the cat everytime in the same manner.

 Directly before and after the provocation test the symptoms will be recorded in the eCRF by using an iPad mini.
