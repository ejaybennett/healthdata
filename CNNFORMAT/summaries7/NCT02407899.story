(firstQuint)Protective Effects of Saxagliptin (And Vitamin D3) on  Cell Function in Patients With Adult-onset Latent Autoimmune Diabetes.

 LADA is actually a form of type 1 diabetes, which is caused by autoimmune damage of islet cells and triggered by environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility.

 LADA shows some characteristics of type 2 diabetes at its onset, which develops slowly and latently, and easily be misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes due to slowly cell function deterioration.

 This is a multi-center, open-label, 1:1:1 randomized controlled trial to investigate the protective efficacy of saxagliptin and vitamin D3 in LADA patients previously treated with insulin.

 The study comprises twice screening, the 8-week run-in period and the 104-week treatment period.

 The first screening is to choose the LADA patients from the diabetes patients whose disease duration -cell function in patients with LADA.

 The main purpose of this study: evaluate whether saxagliptin (and vitamin D3) with insulin therapy can better protect islet cell function than insulin alone.
