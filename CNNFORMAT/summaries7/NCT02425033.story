(thirdQuint)POEM for Spastic Esophageal Disorders.

 Standard surgical care for spastic esophageal disorders such as achalasia includes a procedure called Heller myotomy.

 The treatment in our study, called endoscopic myotomy (also known as peroral endoscopic myotomy - POEM) is different from standard surgery (Heller myotomy) because it is less invasive, is less likely to cause reflux, and usually requires shorter operative times with less loss of blood during the surgery.

 Although POEM has been adopted worldwide and has proven to be successful, the experience in Canada is very limited to date.

 POEM for Spastic Esophageal Disorders@highlight

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) technique for lower esophageal sphincter myotomy in patients suffering from spastic esophageal disorders such as achalasia at a Canadian institution.

 The investigators hypothesize that POEM is a safe and effective technique for the surgical management of such disorders at our institution.
