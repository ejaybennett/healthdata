(thirdQuint)Comparison of RPL554 With Placebo and Salbutamol in Asthmatic Patients.

 A seven way crossover study to investigate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of inhaled RPL554 compared to salbutamol and placebo in patients with mild to moderate chronic asthma.

 Salbutamol is a marketed beta-2 agonist typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any cause, allergen asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but has associated dose-related systemic side effects.

 RPL554 is a dual PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitor that has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory actions and also the potential to stimulate increases in mucociliary clearance via its proven ability to activate CFTR.

 Four different doses of RPL554 will be compared with placebo and a two doses of salbutamol as benchmarks for bronchodilation and systemic side effects.

 Comparison of RPL554 With Placebo and Salbutamol in Asthmatic Patients@highlight

The number of people with of asthma and allergy is still increasing and a large number of patients still do not have their asthma well controlled.

 There is therefore a need for new asthma treatments that work well and have less side effects.

 The study compares a new experimental drug RPL554 with a marketed asthma drug (salbutamol) and placebo.
