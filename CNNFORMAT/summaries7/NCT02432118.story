(fifthQuint)Radiofrequency-Guided Localization in Patients With Abnormal Breast Tissue Undergoing Lumpectomy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To obtain human clinical data in order to demonstrate that the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) Localization System performs as intended as a localization device for marking and retrieving a surgical target in the breast.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To solicit feedback from the radiologists and surgeons regarding the process and use of the RFID system.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiofrequency-guided localization comprising RFID tag placement before lumpectomy and interactive detection of tag using RFID reader during lumpectomy.

 Radiofrequency-Guided Localization in Patients With Abnormal Breast Tissue Undergoing Lumpectomy@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the radiofrequency-guided localization in patients with abnormal breast tissue undergoing lumpectomy (a type of breast-sparing surgery).

 The radiofrequency identification localization system consists of an implantable radiofrequency identification tag and a hand-held radiofrequency reader to mark abnormal breast tissue before surgery and later surgically retrieve them.

 Radiofrequency-guided localization may make it easier to find and remove abnormal breast tissue during lumpectomy.
