(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Anifrolumab Compared to Placebo in Adult Subjects With Active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

 This is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intravenous treatment regimen of anifrolumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) while receiving standard of care (SOC) treatment.

 The study will be performed in adult subjects aged 18 to 70 years of age.

 Approximately 360 subjects receiving SOC treatment will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a fixed intravenous dose of anifrolumab or placebo every 4 weeks for a total of 13 doses (Week 0 to Week 48), with the primary endpoint evaluated at the Week 52 visit.

 Investigational product will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion via an infusion pump over a minimum of 30 minutes, every 4 weeks.
