(secondQuint)Decrease of Neuropsychiatric Side Effects After Switching From Atripla to Eviplera.

 40 patients on Atripla for at least 12 weeks with undetectable HIV-1 viral load will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in a ratio of 1:1: half of the patients will be switched to Eviplera and half will remain on Atripla.

 Neuropsychiatric symptoms will be evaluated using specific questionnaires (anxiety and depression scales, sleeping quality scale, etc) and neurocognitive functions will be assessed using standard tests (Trail A and B, memory tests, etc).

 Patient satisfaction will be assessed using a visual analog scale.

 Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the rate of patients with HIV vilral load under 50 copies/mL.
