(secondQuint)Study of the CD40 Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody APX005M.

 APX005M-001 is an open-label study and comprises a dose-escalation portion of approximately 8 dose level cohorts, plus an expansion cohort.

 Eligible subjects with solid tumors will receive intravenous APX005M every 3 week, every 2 week or every 1 week until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, whichever occurs first.

 Study objectives include: - Evaluate safety of APX005M - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of APX005M - Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of APX005M: the maximal drug concentration (Cmax), area under the curve of serum concentration over time (Area Under the Curve/ AUC), and half-life (t 1/2).

 - Preliminary assessment of clinical response.

 Study of the CD40 Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody APX005M@highlight

This study is a phase 1 open-label dose escalation study of the immuno-activating monoclonal antibody APX005M in adults with solid tumors.

 Study is intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the overall safety and tolerability of APX005M in 3 different administration schedules.
