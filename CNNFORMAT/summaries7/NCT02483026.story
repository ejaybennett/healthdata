(secondQuint)Nutritional Deficiencies Preventive Treatment Prior to Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.

 The present study hypothesis holds that providing an adequate nutritional supplements program prior to the surgery, combined with postoperative monitoring, will significantly lower the incidence of nutritional deficiencies in patients undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery, and will reduce complications arising from these pre-operative deficiencies.

 The investigators plan to examine the effect of Vitamins supplementation prior to surgery on the status of postoperative deficiencies one year after the surgery.

 Evaluation of outcomes will be made based on the results of blood tests specified, and related tests of bone density.
