(firstQuint)Dispensing Study to Assess the Visual Performance of Optimised Prototype Contact Lenses.

 Prospective, double-masked, crossover, bilateral wear, dispensing clinical trial where participants will wear multiple prototype (test) and commercial (control) lenses.

 Multiple prototype contact lens designs will be assessed against commercial control lenses during the study, where each design will be worn for up to a week.

 There will be a minimum 1 night washout period between lens designs.
