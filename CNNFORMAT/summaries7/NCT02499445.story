(fifthQuint)Myocardial Injury in Remifentanil-based Versus Sevoflurane-sufentanil Balanced Regimens in OPCAB Surgery.

 To determine the difference of myocardial injury upon using different anesthesia regimens: remifentanil-based regimen versus sevoflurane-sufentanil balanced regimen.

 Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery are randomly allocated to get remifentanil (0.

75 mcg/kg/min) and propofol (TCI effect-site concentration 0.

8-1.

5 mcg/ml) (Group -RP), remifentanil (0.

75 mcg/kg/min) and sevoflurane (end-tidal 0.

8 vol%) (Group-RS), or sevoflurane (end-tidal 1.

2-2.

8 vol%)-sufentanil (TCI effect site concentration0.

35-0.

75 ng/ml) (Group-SS).

 Intergroup difference in the level of Troponin I (c-TnI) and creatine kinase-MB is determined before surgery (control), during vascular graft harvesting (harvesting), after completing graft construction (postgrafting), 1 day after surgery (postoperative).
