(secondQuint)Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Trial RandOmizing Heparin.

 The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and clinical effect of a continuous low-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (LDIVH) infusion for the prevention of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) induced neurocognitive dysfunction and other delayed neurological deficits.

 Additionally, increased blood and CSF levels of certain inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, hsCRP, etc) have been correlated to aSAH patients with poor clinical outcomes.

 Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has known anti-inflammatory actions.

 As a result, a secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate whether LDIVH can reduce blood and CSF inflammatory biomarkers levels compared to controls and whether there is any association between inflammatory biomarker levels and cognitive outcomes in aSAH.
