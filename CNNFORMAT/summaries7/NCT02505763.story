(secondQuint)Thoracic Ultrasound in the Treatment of Pleural Effusion.

 Comparison of two management strategies pleural effusions from diagnosis and during the first year of follow up care.

 Patients are randomized into two groups, each group receiving a different management strategy.

 Both strategies are compared: Strategy A that involves the systematic use of thoracic ultrasound for the treatment of pleural effusion, treatment and follow up care.

 It will be possible to have recourse to other tests (such as chest CT) if deemed necessary by the practitioner.

 Strategy B, which consists of the usual care pleurisy and thus without use of ultrasound: gestures are guided either by chest radiograph or by CT chest as necessary in the treatment and monitoring.

 A systematic radiographic pleural after each gesture is performed.

 The management is inspired by the English recommendations currently validated and applied in Anglo-Saxon countries.

The main objective of the study is to assess the cost-effectiveness ratio of two management strategies of pleurisy in adults : a strategy by systematic thoracic ultrasound versus a strategy without thoracic ultrasound.
