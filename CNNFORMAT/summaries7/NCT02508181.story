(firstQuint)Comparison of Intra Ocular Pressure After Insertion of the LMA Supreme and LMA Proseal in Pediatric Patients.

 We already know that tracheal intubation increased intraocular pressure.

 We tried to evaluate the change of the intra ocular pressure increase before, during and after insertion the I-gel and LMA Supreme supraglottic airway devices.

 We enrolled the pediatric patients who are undergoing to strabismus surgery.

 Comparison of Intra Ocular Pressure After Insertion of the LMA Supreme and LMA Proseal in Pediatric Patients@highlight

The investigators enrolled pediatric patients who are undergoing strabismus surgery.

 The investigators insert either an I-gel or laryngeal mask airway Supreme and measure the intraocular pressures.
