(firstQuint)Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmia Risk Evaluation.

 Baseline ECG markers of electrical instability will be measured in patients with cardiomyopathy.

 These ECG markers will be evaluated from a clinical Holter recording.

 All patients will have a primary implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as part of their clinical care.

 Patients will be followed prospectively for 2 years to evaluate the primary outcome of appropriate ICD shocks.

 Multivariable modelling will be performed to determine whether the ECG markers of electrical instability independently predict the primary clinical outcome.

This study will evaluate the prognostic utility of novel ECG markers of electrical instability in patients with cardiomyopathy.
