(firstQuint)Laser Acupuncture Versus High Protein/Low Carbohydrate Diet on Endothelial Markers in Obese Females.

 Sixty females above 20 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of over 30 kg/m2 will be divided into three groups (20 in each): two experimental groups (laser; high protein low carbohydrate diet) and control.

 Each subject will receive the treatment relevant to their group, in addition to obtaining 3 days dietary recalls and measurements including BMI, serum insulin and endothelial markers.

 Laser and control group will receive 24 activated or sham laser acupuncture treatments.

 High protein low carbohydrate group will be instructed to take a tailored high protein/low carbohydrate diet.
