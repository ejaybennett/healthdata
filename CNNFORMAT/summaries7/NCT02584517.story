(fifthQuint)Aetiology of TemporaL Arteritis Study.

 Objectives and Study Plan: Study Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the underlying immunological processes in GCA and to study the pattern of expression of immune response over time to give us information about how best to monitor GCA.

 End Point: The end point will be the final visit of the final patient.

 Milestones: The project is in 3 phases.

 In phase 1 (0-2 years) patients will be recruited to fulfil the specified primary and secondary objectives.

 In phase 2 (0-4 years), these patients will be followed up for a total of 2 years each, or until they are discharged from clinic.

 In phase 3 (1-5 years), further studies will be defined and tissue and data collected under amended ethics.

 Aetiology of TemporaL Arteritis Study@highlight

Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis and has significant morbidity in terms of blindness, stroke, and tissue necrosis.

 It requires protracted treatment with high-dose steroids, and despite this there is a risk of flare during the treatment.

 Little is known about the initial triggers for the inflammatory process, and there are no good markers of response or relapse.

 We will study patients referred with suspected GCA to identify important components of the immune response in GCA, and follow them over time to collect evidence of how best to monitor their condition.
