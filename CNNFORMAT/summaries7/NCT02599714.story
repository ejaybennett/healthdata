(fifthQuint)Study of AZD2014 and Palbociclib in Patients With Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 This is a Phase I/II international, multicenter study of the combination of AZD2014 and palbociclib on a background of 500 mg fulvestrant (referred to as the triplet) in postmenopausal women with locally advanced/metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer.

 The study consists of three parts: Part A is a Phase I triplet-dose finding investigation in 3-6 patients per cohort to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the triplet.

 Part B is a single arm expansion in approximately 27 patients evaluable for response to define the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).

 Part C will investigate the efficacy of the triplet combination at the RP2D in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel group extension.

 Part C will include ER+, locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed following prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) endocrine therapy.

 Patients in Part C will be randomized to receive either the triplet combination (AZD2014 + palbociclib + fulvestrant) or the doublet (matching AZD2014 placebo + palbociclib + fulvestrant).

 Patients will be stratified according to hormone sensitivity, presence of visceral metastases, and prior CDK inhibitor treatment.

 Part C will be conducted if indicated by the emerging data.

 Study of AZD2014 and Palbociclib in Patients With Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

This dose finding/extension study consists of three parts: Part A will identify the MTD of the AZD2014/palbociclib combination on a background of fulvestrant (referred to as the triplet) in postmenopausal women with locally advanced/metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer.

 Part B will further characterize safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy in single-arm dose expansion groups.

 Part C will investigate the efficacy of the triplet combination in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel group extension.
