(firstQuint)The Effects of Gabapentin and Ramosetron on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Laparoscopic Gynecological Surgery.

 Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the postanesthesia care unit is a common occurrence after general anesthesia.

 And laparoscopic gynecological surgery is associated with a high incidence of PONV.

 Several antiemetic agents such as dopaminergic, histaminic and 5-HT3 antagonist (including ondansetron, ramosetron, granisetron) have been used to prevent PONV.

 Gabapentin, anti-convulsant, has been shown to decrease PONV, as well as chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in recent studies, although the exact mechanism against PONV is not known.

 The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of gabapentin and ramosetron in preventing PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery.
