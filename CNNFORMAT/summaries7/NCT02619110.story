(firstQuint)The Effect of Backward Walking Treadmill Training on Balance in Patient With Chronic Stroke.

 Walking training is a good method and strategy to improve postural stability, balance, gait symmetry, and increase walking ability.

 Generally, there are many walking training theories and methods for patients with chronic stroke and treadmill walking training is applied in recent years.

 Previous studies showed that patients with stroke improve the walking abilities and speed after the walking treadmill training.

 However, most studies have demonstrated that forward walking treadmill training improved balance and walking ability in patients with stroke, but fewer studies have investigated the effects on backward walking treadmill training.

 However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of backward walking treadmill training for patients with chronic stroke.
