(thirdQuint)18F-choline and 18F-FDG PET-MR of Symptomatic Carotid Plaques.

 Accumulation and subsequent activation of inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic plaques play an essential role in transforming a stable plaque into a vulnerable plaque at risk to rupture.

 On this basis, the study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 18F-choline PET in identifying ongoing inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques.

 The investigators hypothesize that 18F-choline PET is efficient in detecting intraplaque inflammation and identify vulnerable plaques that are prone to rupture in comparison to the stable ones.

 It is likely that by correlating the inflammatory status of an atherosclerotic plaque (on 18F-choline PET) with the presence of other vulnerable plaque features (on MR imaging) would be of high clinical relevance for clinical diagnosis of vulnerable plaques.

Accumulating data in the literature suggests that radiolabeled-choline (18F-choline) is a sensitive molecular tracer for PET imaging that is taken up in activated cells and, as such, is able to identify active inflammatory sites.

 The investigators hypothesize that 18F-choline is also highly taken up in vulnerable plaques in comparison to the stable ones.
