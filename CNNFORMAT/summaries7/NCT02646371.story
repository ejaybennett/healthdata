(secondQuint)Phase 2b Challenge Study With the Bioconjugate Vaccine Flexyn2a.

 Flexyn2a is a bioconjugate candidate vaccine that is able to induce an humoral immune response specific for the 2a-antigen of Shigella flexneri 2a bacteria.

 Healthy adult volunteers naive for Shigella flexneri 2a infections at screening will receive two administrations of 10 micrograms Flexyn2a or placebo 4 weeks apart.

 Four weeks after the second vaccination, each subject will be challenged with 1500 cfu of the virulent Shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457T.

 In order to assess the ability of Flexyn2a to protect against infection with this strain, the attack rate of shigellosis in the group vaccinated with Flexyn2a will be compared to the group of the subjects who received placebo injections.

In this proof of concept challenge study, the bioconjugate candidate vaccine Flexyn2a will be tested for its ability to induce an immune response that protects healthy adult volunteers from infection with a wild-type Shigella flexneri 2a strain compared to subjects receiving placebo.
