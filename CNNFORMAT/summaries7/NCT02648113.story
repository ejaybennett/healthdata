(fifthQuint)Cost-effectiveness and Cost-utility of Liberal vs Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Strategies in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Anaemia.

.

 Anemia is frequent in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).

 The antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents used for MI treatment increase the risk of bleeding, which in turn increases the risk of ischemia and mortality.

 Anemia is an independent predictor of cardiac events in this setting.

 In the "FAST-MI 2010" nationwide registry, the prevalence of anemia (defined as Hb 200 000 patients) reported a higher risk of mortality and recurrent MI in MI patients who received transfusion.

 More recently, a careful observational study has shown that the majority of patients undergoing blood transfusion cannot be matched with non-transfused patients due to their markedly different clinical profiles, indicating that observational studies cannot reliable establish the benefits or risks of transfusion because they are hopelessly influenced by selection bias.

 These results strongly highlight the need for randomized trials to establish the role of transfusion during acute MI, a call for a randomized trial that has been echoed by several thought leaders in the field in recent years.

 Two small randomized trials (respectively 45 and 110 patients) comparing liberal vs.

 restrictive transfusion strategies in MI showed no clear difference in clinical outcomes but were both underpowered.

 The only guideline regarding management of anemia in this setting is from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on non-ST segment elevation - acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), which advise blood transfusion only if the hemodynamic status is compromised or the hemoglobin level is <7g/dL.

 As a result, there is wide variation in clinical practice.

 There is therefore equipoise regarding which transfusion strategy is best.

 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a "restrictive" transfusion strategy (triggered by Hb <= 8 g/ dL) will be clinically non-inferior to a "liberal" transfusion strategy (triggered by Hb <= 10g/ dL) but will be less costly.

 Main objective: The main objective of the study is to compare cost-effectiveness of restrictive (triggered by Hb <= 8 g/ dL) vs liberal (triggered by Hb <= 10g/ dL) red blood transfusion strategies for patients with acute MI and anemia (7g /dL < Hb <= 10g / dL).

 Secondary objective(s): 1.

 The key secondary objective is to perform cost-utility analyses at 30-days and 1 year.

 2.

 The main clinical objective will be to determine whether a restrictive transfusion strategy is clinically non-inferior to a liberal transfusion strategy in terms of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days, defined as the composite of all-cause death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal recurrent MI, and emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia.

 2.

 A tertiary objective will be to compare major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 year, since the impact of transfusion strategies on MACE may be delayed, or conversely, an initial benefit of either strategy may become lost over the first year.

 Cost-effectiveness and Cost-utility of Liberal vs Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Strategies in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Anaemia.

@highlight

Anemia in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) is a relatively frequent issue, resulting in poorer outcome.

 There is equipoise regarding which transfusion strategy is best, and there is an international consensus on the urgent need for a randomized trial.

 The investigators hypothesize that a "restrictive" transfusion strategy is at least non-inferior to a "liberal" transfusion strategy on 30-day outcomes of MI patients with anemia.

 Given the costs and risks of transfusion, a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis becomes key to determining the role of each strategy.
