(fifthQuint)Meta-analyses of Nuts and Risk of Obesity.

 Background: Peanuts and tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts) are an important source of unsaturated fatty acids, vegetable protein, and fibre, as well as minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients.

 The FDA has permitted health claims for tree nuts for cardiovascular disease risk reduction and the cardiovascular benefits of nuts is acknowledged [FDA, 2015; Bao et al.

, 2013; Sabate et al.

, 2010]; however, intake of tree nuts is low in Canada.

 Based on the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), = 1-year duration and assess the relation of tree nuts and/or peanuts with incident overweight/obesity or changes in body weight or markers of adiposity.

 Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

 All disagreements will be resolved by consensus.

 Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data.

 Outcomes: Three sets of outcomes will be assessed: (1) incidence of overweight/obesity, (2) measures of global adiposity (body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat), (3) measures of abdominal adiposity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adipose tissue).

 Data synthesis: Mean differences will be pooled for the trials and risk ratios for the cohorts using the generic inverse variance method.

 Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.

 Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is =10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by age (children [==10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests.

 If publication bias is suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

 Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) [Guyatt et al.

, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f, 2011g, 2011h, 2011i; Balshem et al.

, 2011; Brunetti et al.

, 2013; Guyatt et al.

, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c].

 Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals.

 Target audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

 Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined.

 Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines.

 Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of peanuts and tree nuts in relation to body weight, in particular adiposity and the development of overweight and obesity, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.

 Meta-analyses of Nuts and Risk of Obesity@highlight

Peanuts and tree nuts (almonds, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts) (herein referred to as "nuts") are a good source of unsaturated fatty acids, vegetable protein, fibre, and polyphenolics.

 Nut intake has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk and claims for this association have been permitted by the FDA; however, intake of tree nuts is low in Canada.

 One of the barriers to increasing the consumption of nuts is the perception that they may contribute to weight gain more than other "healthy foods" owing to their high energy density.

 The evidence supporting this concern, however, is lacking.

 In a series of earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we have shown that nuts improve glycemic control and metabolic syndrome criteria, findings which run contrary to any expected weight gain.

 However, it remains unclear whether nuts have an increasing, neutral, or even decreasing effect on body weight.

 To address the uncertainties, the investigators propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the totality of the evidence from controlled trials and prospective cohort studies to investigate the effect of nut consumption on body weight and adiposity.

 The findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design
