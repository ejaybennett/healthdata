(thirdQuint)Vertebral Artery and Cerebral Hemodynamics After Various Head Positions & Manipulation in Patients With Neck Pain.

 The goal of the study is to further investigate in patients with chronic/recurrent neck pain, the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine positions, including manipulation, in vivo under clinically relevant circumstances using two advanced MRI technology on the vertebral and posterior cerebral and cerebellar blood flow dynamics affecting brain perfusion.

 According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study utilizing MRI to examine blood flow and perfusion, turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these blood vessels has yet to be conducted.
