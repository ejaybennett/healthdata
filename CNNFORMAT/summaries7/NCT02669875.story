(thirdQuint)Serelaxin To Lower Portal Pressure.

 This study will investigate the effects of the investigational drug serelaxin (a recombinant form of the peptide human relaxin-2) on portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.

 The investigators will measure portal pressure by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and hepatic blood flow by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance to evaluate the potential benefits of the drug.

 In a recently completed small exploratory open-label phase 2 study (EudraCT no.

 201200023626, NCT01640964), Part B demonstrated that serelaxin can lower portal pressure.

 Serelaxin To Lower Portal Pressure@highlight

Portal hypertension (an increase in blood pressure in the portal vein that carries the blood from the intestine and spleen to the liver) underlies most of the serious complications of liver cirrhosis.

 This randomised placebo controlled study in people with liver cirrhosis evaluates the acute effects serelaxin (RLX030) infusion on portal hypertension and liver blood flow.
