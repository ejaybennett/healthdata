(firstQuint)Study of HuMab-5B1 (MVT-5873) in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer or Other Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Positive Malignancies.

 Open label, multi-center, nonrandomized, dose escalation trial of MVT-5873 to evaluate safety and determine the MTD and recommended phase II dose of MVT-5873 both as monotherapy (Group A) and in combination with a standard of care chemotherapy (Group B) in subjects with pancreatic and other CA19-9 positive malignancies.

 Both groups will utilize a conventional 3+3 study design to identify the MTD and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

 following determination of MTD, 10 additional subjects will be treated at the RP2D in each group.

 The pharmacokinetics (PK) of MVT-5873 will be determined in each Group.
