(thirdQuint)Is More Than One Dose of Misoprostol Needed to Expedite Vaginal Delivery in a Patient With an Unripe Cervix?.

 This study involves a comparison of two different regimens of prostaglandin use for "cervical ripening" prior to induction of labor.

 Women admitted to the hospital for induction of labor who are found to have "unripe" cervixes at the time of admission, and who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.

 In one group, a single dose of 25 mu cg of misoprostol will be administered vaginally and four hours later oxytocin induction will be started if clinically indicated.

 In the second group of women, repeat doses of misoprostol will be given every four hours up to six doses unless labor or cervical ripening occurs sooner.

 At this point, oxytocin will be started as needed.

 Success of vaginal delivery by 24 hours, time from initiation of protocol to delivery and cesarean section rates will be compared.

 Complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, episodes of tachysystole with fetal compromise and chorioamnionitis and endometritis will be monitored.

 Is More Than One Dose of Misoprostol Needed to Expedite Vaginal Delivery in a Patient With an Unripe Cervix?@highlight

The goal of this study is to determine whether inducing labor with just one dose of misoprostol, followed by treatment with oxytocin, will still be effective enough to increase the chances of having a successful vaginal delivery as compared to using more than one dose of misoprostol, followed by treatment with oxytocin.
