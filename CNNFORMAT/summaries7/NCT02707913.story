(fifthQuint)Clinical Bioequivalence Study on Two Amlodipine Tablet 10mg Formulations.

 The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover with a washout period of two to three weeks.

 During each session, the subjects will be administered a single oral dose of 10mg amlodipine (one BF-Amlodipine Tablet 10mg or one Norvasc Tablet 10mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours.

 Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0 h), and up to 96 h post dose.

 The plasma concentrations of amlodipine will be determined by a validated assay.

 The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-last, AUC0-inf) and Elimination half-life (T1/2).

 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf.

 The two one sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax, and to assess the bioequivalence of the two products.

 Clinical Bioequivalence Study on Two Amlodipine Tablet 10mg Formulations@highlight

The purpose of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of amlodipine with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions.

 The test product name is BF-Amlodipine Tablet 10mg manufactured by Bright Future Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited, and the reference product is Norvasc Tablet 10mg.

 The plasma pharmacokinetic data of amlodipine obtained from two formulations will be used to access the interchangeability of the products
