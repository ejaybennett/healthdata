(fifthQuint)Determine the Effective Dose 95 of Sevoflurane in Adult Patients.

 Introduction Some studies showed evidence of cardio-protection and reduction in mortality due to the use of volatile agents during cardiac surgery.

 (1) These findings seems to be associated when the volatile agents are used during all the surgical procedure, including the period of CPB.

 (2) Sevoflurane is the most volatile anesthetic used during CPB.

 In addition to the cardioprotective effect, Sevoflurane also promotes reduction in systemic vascular resistance (4.

5) and also an important role in anesthesia maintenance during surgery, preventing patients awaken in the intraoperative (6.

7).

 To avoid the awakening during surgery, assessment of the level of consciousness through the bispectral index (BIS) has been the most common method used by anesthesiologists.

 During cardiac surgery the most critical moment may be the patient is awaken during the warm up phase of CPB.

 The monitoring of this phase with the BIS has become efficient as to alert the anesthetist that the patient may be waking up.

 (3) In addition, several studies have been trying to find what is the ideal minimum dose of inhaled anesthetics that 95% of patients do not awaken during some surgical procedures (ED 95).

 (8-25).

 However, there are no studies that demonstrate what is the ideal minimum dose of inhaled anesthetics used during CPB in cardiac surgery, so patients do not have any conscience at this stage.

 Case we have this information, even when it is not possible to monitor the level of consciousness using the BIS, the risk for patients to awaken during the intraoperative period, especially the CEC, would become significantly reduced.

 The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the ideal minimum dose of sevoflurane (ED 95) that 95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery have no intraoperative awareness.

 Secondary endpoints include neurocognitive assessment using the Mini Mental Test; Intraoperative assessment of memory; time of endotracheal intubation (OTI); length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU); and hospital stay.

 Methodology Selection and randomization of patients Upon approval by the Research Ethics Committee of the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology (IDPC), eligible patients will be addressed by the researcher for the study.

 All patients participating in this study must sign a consent form.

 Inclusion criteria: Patients with physical status ASA II to III undergoing first elective cardiac surgery for mitral and / or tricuspid valve with cardiopulmonary bypass undergoing general anesthesia; Exclusion criteria: Patients with contraindications to the study drugs; Reoperations cardiac surgery; History of psychiatric or neurological disease, drug abuse, or drugs known to affect the central nervous system; Pregnancy; Emergency procedures; Neuraxial blockade; Anesthetic technique The techniques used for anesthesia, surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass follow the practice routine of the institution.

 Patients will receive 5 mg of Midazolam IM as Preanesthetic medication 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia.

 Routine monitoring will include electrocardiogram five derivations and pulse oximetry.

 Before induction of anesthesia, a radial artery catheter will be inserted along with the monitoring BIS (BIS Vista cent ; Covidien).

 Anesthesia is induced with 0.

3 mu g/kg sufentanil and 0.

2-0.

3 mg/kg etomidate based on the physical condition of the patient.

 Muscle relaxation is obtained using 0.

1 mg/kg pancuronium.

 After tracheal intubation, a central venous catheter is inserted into the subclavian vein.

 The temperature of the patient will be monitored by a thermometer in the esophagus.

 Anesthesia will be maintained with bolus Sufentanil according to the patient's need and Sevoflurane to 1 MAC expired fraction.

 Mechanical ventilation will be maintained at Drager apparatus (Primus model) with the following parameters: tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, respiratory rate 12 ipm, PEEP of 5 cm H2O in ventilation mode controlled volume.

 Before the insertion of the aortic cannula, patients will be anti-coagulated with heparin (400 units / kg) and subjected to a muscular relaxation with 0.

05 mg/kg pancuronium.

 CPB circuit The CPB circuit contains a roller pump, and a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator microporous polypropylene (PPL), with a rigid venous reservoir.

 The bypass circuit will be prepared using 1,400 ml of saline solution 0.

9%, 100 ml Albumin 20% and 5,000 units of Heparin.

 After heparinization, the surgeon will make cannulation of the aorta artery followed by cannulation of veins upper and lower Cavas, respectively.

 During CPB, the patient's temperature is maintained at 35 C with the valve replacement procedure performed with intermittent cross-clamping.

 The pH-stat system for analysis of blood gases is utililizado to control the acid-base balance in all patients.

 The target blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass would be 2.

4 liters / min / m2 and is increased to 3.

2 liters / min / m2 in order to maintain the central venous oxygen saturation above 75%.

 The activated clotting time will be at least 480 s during the infusion.

 The fresh gas flow rate in the supply of gas to the oxygenator will be adapted by the perfusionist to maintain arterial carbon dioxide from 30 to 35 mmHg.

 The concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture delivered to the oxygenator will be 30-80% depending on the partial pressure of arterial oxygen at a partial pressure of oxygen above the target of 80 mmHg measured at oxygenated blood flow.

 During CPB, including the rewarming phase of the patient (normothermia time - temperature ranging from 36 to 37.

5 C), end tidal sevoflurane concentration will be maintained in accordance with the preview-set value by Up-and-Down method Dixon studied for each patient.

 During this period will be evaluated BIS value constantly.

 During CPB, no intravenous anesthetic drug will be used until it is needed with the BIS values 50 for a period 1 minute.

 After rewarming, the surgeon will proceed to remove air from the cardiac cavities and ending CPB.

 Reversal of Heparin will be conducted with Protamine (reversal of 80% of the heparin dose).

 Dixon's up-and-down technique Dixon's up-and-down technique is a commonly used method to define MAC (27-30).

 The anesthetic concentration applied to the first patient is estimated by clinical experience.

 If there BIS values below 50, the concentration of inhalational anesthetic in subsequent patient is decreased by 20%.

 If the BIS show values greater than or equal to 50 for a period 1 minute steadily, the concentration is increased by 20% in the next patient.

 In each series of patients, the pairs of independent cross in order measurements are identified.

 A pair of cross consists of two consecutive patients where there is a BIS value below 50 in the first but not the second patient, or vice versa.

 Each patient was considered only for one single cross-over pair in order to assure independent test data.

 Six independent cross-over pairs and +/- 10 changes in direction are required to obtain reliable results (26).

 Statistical analysis Logistic regression is used to determine the ideal minimum dose of sevoflurane (ED 95) that 95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery have no intraoperative awareness.

 The level of consciousness will be evaluated maintaining the value of the bispectral index (BIS) below 50 during CPB.

 The probability of BS (p) is modelled in terms of log odds by a linear function of the independent explanatory variable 'measured concentration' X by a logistic regression: log [p/(1-p)] = A + B x X where A (intercept) and B (regression slope) are the model parameters.

 The solution of 0,95 = exp (A + B x X) / [1 + exp (A + B x X)] results in the MAC value estimation.

 To quantify uncertainty of the MAC values, 95% percentile bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) were used.

 Statistical evaluation and figures were performed using R (R Development Core Team, http://www.
