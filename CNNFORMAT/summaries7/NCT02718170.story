(firstQuint)Buried Intramedullary K-wire Fixation Compared With Plate and Screw Fixation for Metacarpal Fractures in Unstable Extra-Articular Metacarpal Fractures.

 Metacarpal fractures are a common injury to the hand.

 Most fractures occur due to direct force from either a axial load to the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joint or low energy fall onto an outstretched hand.

 Many of these fractures can be treated closed with a closed reduction and splinting however, some displaced or angulated fractures require open reduction and internal fixation.

 Many fixation techniques have been used, however to the investigators knowledge, no one has prospectively randomized patients to compare plate and screw fixation with buried intramedullary k-wire fixation.

 The purpose of this study is to compare Plate and screw and buried intramedullary fixation, using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire as the primary outcome measured.

 Secondary outcomes will include total active motion, complications, cost, reoperation rate.
