(fifthQuint)Video-Based Social Learning or Didactics for Car Seat Education.

 Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of child passenger safety education, however, there is limited research identifying an optimal teaching method.

 Social learning teaching methods are beneficial in promoting health-behavior change.

 The social learning theory hypothesizes that people learn and change their behavior by observation and modeling.

 The video used in the social learning method shows parents as role models methodically teaching proper car seat installation in a vehicle.

 Traditionally, child passenger safety education classes are didactic in design, relying on lecture formats and live demonstrations.

 The didactic method includes verbal instructions from a child passenger safety technician about car seat installation.

This study compares a video-based social learning method to the traditional didactic method as a new way to teach caregivers about child passenger safety, including how to install a car seat.

 Half of the caregivers will attend the video-based social learning class, while the other half will attend the traditional didactic class.

 The investigators hypothesize that the video-based social learning method will lead to an equal or greater increase in caregiver child passenger safety proficiency when compared to the traditional didactic method.
