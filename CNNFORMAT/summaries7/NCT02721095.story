 Hypokalemia is frequently encountered in hospitalized patients.

 Intravenous (IV) potassium repletion with saline is preferred used for initial therapy.

 However, administration of normal saline (0.

9%NaCl) usually provokes sodium and potassium diuresis, thus, it might delay reversal of the hypokalemia.

 Object of this study : to evaluate efficacy and safety of IV administration of potassium chloride (KCl) plus 0.

9%NaCl compare with KCl plus half-strength normal saline solution (0.

45%NaCl) in correcting hypokalemia.
