(secondQuint)Effects of PRJ-205 on Performance in Trained Young Subjects.

 Twenty young active males will be recruited and randomized to either placebo or PRJ-205.

 Subjects will take the designated treatment in an acute dosage and chronically, 4 days of treatment.

 They will undergo 3 exercise tasks (before the administration of the product, 1.

5h after the acute administration of the product and after 4 days of treatment).

 VO2max and anaerobic threshold will be measured during the tests.

 Blood samples will be taken to measure muscle damage and oxidative stress.

 Effects of PRJ-205 on Performance in Trained Young Subjects@highlight

Compare a dietary supplement (PRJ-205) and placebo during 1 or 4 days on aerobic exercise performance, oxidative stress and muscle damage.

 The hypothesis is that supplementation with PRJ-205 improve aerobic performance
