 Stratification Patients are stratified according to: 1.

 Number of prior lines of therapy (primary advanced disease vs.

 1st relapse vs.

 2 relapses) 2.

 evaluable disease 3.

 Prior use of MPA/Megace Randomization 1:1 randomization The patients with prior MPA/Megace treatment will be capped to a maximum of 50%.

 Study arms Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms: - Arm A: (comparator) letrozole-placebo combination therapy until progression.
