(fifthQuint)Phase 4 Field Study for Analyzing the Psychometric Properties of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) LC29.

 The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items that are grouped in five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), one scale to rate global health and quality of life, three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and five single symptom items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhea), one item assessing perceived financial impact of disease and treatment [18].

 Patients rate items using a four-point Likert response scale with the exception of the scale on global health and quality of life which is accompanied by a seven-point response format.

 A time period is not specified for the physical functioning scale items.

 The time frame for all remaining items is the past week.

 The updated lung cancer module, the QLQ-LC29, is a module to be used in conjunction with the QLQ-C30 for the assessment of quality of life in patients with lung cancer.

 All items are accompanied by the classic EORTC a four-point Likert response scale with the labels 1 "not at all", 2 "a little", 3 "quite a bit", and 4 "very much".

 The time frame for the entire module is the past week ("Please indicate the extent to which you have experienced these symptoms or problems during the past week").

 A content analysis of the items and a preliminary psychometric calculation (Cronbach's alpha) of Phase 3 data suggest that the QLQ-LC29 is composed of five multi-item scales and five single items.

 Inclusion Criteria - histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer - no previous primary or recurrent tumour - ability to understand the language of the questionnaire - mental fitness to complete a questionnaire - 18 years of age or above - written informed consent.

 Exclusion Criteria Inversely, exclusion criteria are the negation of the above specified characteristics, i.

e.

, no histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer, previous primary or recurrent tumour, not mentally fit to complete a questionnaire, not able to understand the language of the questionnaire, younger than 18, and refusal of informed consent.

 Sampling matrix Participants will be enrolled in three groups according to their primary therapy (A.

 Surgery, B.

 Radiochemotherapy, C.

 Targeted therapy).

 Various combinations of therapies are permissible, resulting in a total of eight subgroups (A.

1 Surgery alone and/or before any adjuvant therapy, A.

2 Surgery [late effects], B.

1 Chemotherapy alone, B.

2 Radiotherapy alone, B.

3 Sequential radiochemotherapy, B.

4 Concurrent radiochemotherapy, C.

1 Targeted therapy alone, C.

2 Targeted therapy in combination with any other therapy, D.

 Immunotherapy).

 Sample size According to sample size calculations we will include a total of N = 450 patients.

 N = 120 of these patients will be asked to fill in the questionnaires at a second time point, of which a subgroup of n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (patients who are clinically stable and indicate no change on an anchor question over the two assessment points), and another n = 60 will be subjected to test-retest analyses (those who indicate a change to the worse or to the better).

 Statistical analyses Standard psychometric analyses will be employed to evaluate the hypothesized scale structure of the QLQ-LC29 and its internal consistency, convergent and discriminate validity, as well as test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change.

 Phase 4 Field Study for Analyzing the Psychometric Properties of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) LC29@highlight

The aim of the Phase 4 study is to test the scale structure, reliability, responsiveness to change and validity of the EORTC QLQ-LC29 in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in patients diagnosed with lung cancer.

 Participants will be enrolled in three groups according to their primary therapy (A.

 Surgery, B.

 Radiochemotherapy, C.

 Targeted therapy, D.

 Immunotherapy).

 Various combinations of therapies are permissible, resulting in a total of eight subgroups (A.

1 Targeted therapy alone, C.

2 Targeted therapy in combination with any other therapy, D.
