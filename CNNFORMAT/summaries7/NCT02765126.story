(fifthQuint)Heterologous Effect of Diptheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis Vaccination on Influenza Challenge in the Elderly.

 This prospective randomised study aims to investigate the heterologous immunological effects of DTP and seasonal influenza (Flu) vaccination in an elderly Tasmanian population and healthy adults.

 The study will assess whether prior or concurrent administration of DTP with seasonal Flu vaccination affects generalised inflammation / immune homeostasis and gene expression, with a particular focus of inflammation reactive cells.

 It will also analyse for effects of DTP on the induction of vaccine-specific immunity to seasonal influenza vaccination (antibodies and cellular).

 Volunteers will be randomised to one of three vaccine groups and serial blood samples taken for immunological assays for up to 30 weeks.

 The study is exploratory and will investigate vaccine effects on multiple immune parameters.

 Heterologous Effect of Diptheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis Vaccination on Influenza Challenge in the Elderly@highlight

Vaccines can have non-targeted or heterologous (also called non-specific) immunological effects on the immune system i.

e.

 effects other than inducing an immune response against the disease targeted by the vaccine.

 This trial aims to evaluate the non-specific immunological effects of two vaccines - diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTP) vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine - in a cohort of elderly humans (>65 years of age) and healthy adult control subjects (30-50 years).
