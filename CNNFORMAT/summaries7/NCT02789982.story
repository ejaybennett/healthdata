(fifthQuint)Using Reconsolidation Blockade to Treat Trauma Related Disorders After Paris Attacks: an Effectiveness Study.

 The November 13th Paris attacks were the most violent and devastating events to occur in France since World War II.

 A large number of persons are likely to develop PTSD or trauma-related disorders, especially victims directly involved, their families, as well as the the first responders.

 In this context, there is an urgent need to enhance treatment resources.

 Psychotherapy is known to be effective but it is costly, and require qualified professionals.

 Pharmacotherapy (e.

g.

, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,SSRIs) is also considered effective.

 However, side effects often lead patients to abandon their treatment.

 An alternative evidence-based intervention is the use of the -adrenergic blocker propranolol used to interfere with the reconsolidation of a recalled traumatic memory, so as to reduce its strength over time.

 This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade compared to treatment as usual.

 The study involves four assessments: pre- and post-treatment and 13 weeks and 1 year follow up.

 The outcome measures include: PTSD symptoms, socioeconomic variables, quality of life and social functioning measures.

 The investigators hypothesize that all patients will improve.

 However, patients receiving reconsolidation blockade will recover faster than treatment as usual.

 Finally, investigators hypothesize that reconsolidation blockade will be well accepted both by the professionals and the patients.

The purpose of this study is: (1) to examine the effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade as a treatment for trauma-related disorders, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing this new treatment on a large scale in a short delay.

 This clinical trial as been set up in response to the Paris attacks to increase treatment capacity of the AP-HP (Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris) hospital network.

.

 Reconsolidation blockade will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU), on symptoms reduction after 6 weeks of treatment.

 In order to measure effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, socioeconomic measures, quality of life and social functioning outcomes will be measured pre- and post-treatment as well as 3 and 12 months after study enrollment.
