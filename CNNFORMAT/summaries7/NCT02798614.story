(firstQuint)Short Versus Conventional Plaster Cast Fixation Time in Reduced Distal Radius Fractures.

 Displaced distal radius fractures treated with closed reduction and plaster cast fixation are radiographed 10 days (range 8-13 days) after reduction and randomized to one of two study arms; immediate removal of plaster cast or continued fixation in plaster cast for another 3 weeks.

 Radiographic and Clinical outcome measurements at 1, 4 and 12 months.
