(fifthQuint)Optimizing the Assessment of Refractive Outcomes After Cataract Surgery.

 Subjects will be implanted with ACRYSOF(R) IQ Monofocal IOL Model SN60WF.

 Standard clinical practice will be followed for pre-operative testing, IOL power estimation and IOL implantation.

 Only one eye will be enrolled in the study per surgeon determination.

 The eye will undergo both an automated and manual manifest refraction assessment at 3 months postoperative.

 Optimizing the Assessment of Refractive Outcomes After Cataract Surgery@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate current available assessments (automated vs.

 manual) with which manifest refraction data and biometric variables are obtained to understand if data from an automated refractor can be utilized to optimize the A-constant as well as manual subjective refraction (ie, to a clinically insignificant difference).

 The A-constant is the calculated number that helps the surgeon determine which IOL should be implanted in the eye during cataract surgery.
