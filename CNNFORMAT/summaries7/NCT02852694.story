(thirdQuint)Reduce Risk for Crohn's Disease Patients.

 In this randomized controlled trial PIBDNet (pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases network) aims to compare the following treatment strategy by dividing patients into two risk groups for aggressive disease evolution: the effectiveness of Methotrexate versus Azathioprine / 6 mercaptopurine for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease in children who are at low risk for aggressive disease and the effectiveness of Methotrexate versus adalimumab in the high risk group.

 PIBDNet hypothesizes that Methotrexate is superior to Azathioprine / 6 mercaptopurine for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease in the low risk strata and adalimumab is superior to Methotrexate in the high risk strata.

 In addition, the ancillary study is planned to analyse of Adalimumab treated patients from inclusion (TOP-Down) versus patients switched to Adalimumab due to failure of immunomodulator therapy (STEP-Up).

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of weekly subcutaneously administered Methotrexate for maintaining relapse-free sustained steroid/Enteral Nutrition -free 1-year remission compared with: - daily oral Azathioprine / 6 mercaptopurine in low risk paediatric Crohn's disease - subcutaneously administered adalimumab in high risk paediatric Crohn's disease
