(thirdQuint)Computer-Based Behavior Change Guide in Increasing Physical Activity in Patients With Prostate Cancer Who Have Received Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Engage with prostate cancer patients (PCPs) who have received or are currently on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to develop a computer-based behavior change guide (BCG) for PCPs to provide fundamental information about benefits of exercise for their individual capabilities and goals and provide a personalized physical activity plan.

 (Development Phase) II.

 Engage with PCPs to understand what outcomes are most important to them related to becoming active (e.

g.

, helped me manage side-effects of treatment, reduced fatigue) and develop measures to evaluate these patient-centered outcomes.

 (Development Phase) III.

 Evaluate the BCG in a study comparing the personalized computer-based BCG with physical activity recommendations provided via a passive website (American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors) among PCPs who have received ADT.

 (Evaluation Phase) OUTLINE: DEVELOPMENT PHASE: Patients view mock-ups of the BCG web design on a computer, iPad, or printed color paper and provide feedback with a one-on-one interview or separately using the think/talk aloud method followed by a one-on-one interview.

 After completion of these design rounds, patients use the BCG website and provide individual feedback.

 EVALUATION PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

 GROUP I: Patients use the BCG website which will collect personal information including individual health priorities/goals, demographics (i.

e.

 age, ethnicity), health information (i.

e.

 weight, height, cancer history, other health conditions), individual capabilities, physical activity level, and exercise preferences.

 Patients then receive a report with a personalized physical activity plan.

 GROUP II: Patients use a passive website (American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors).

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 months.

 Computer-Based Behavior Change Guide in Increasing Physical Activity in Patients With Prostate Cancer Who Have Received Androgen Deprivation Therapy@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well a computer-based behavior change guide works in increasing physical activity in patients with prostate cancer who have received androgen deprivation therapy.

 A computer-based behavior change guide website may increase physical activity level for prostate cancer survivors and help doctors understand what outcomes related to becoming physically active are most important to patients with prostate cancer.
