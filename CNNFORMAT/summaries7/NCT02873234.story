 The main purpose of this study is to observe the differences between cohorts.

 However, the intra-group differences are also needed to be evaluated, as the therapies of different participants are various.

 Therefore, the number of participants treated with each therapy and the time of recovery need to be counted and analyzed.

 This is a long-term and natural study that participants lost, drug withdrawal and changes in participants'choices of the therapy cannot be avoided.

 So the reason and number of the previous conditions need to be observed.

 The safety of TCM and antidepressants is also a considerable outcome which will be evaluated by laboratory examination, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) and the number of participants with adverse events.

 Some of the outcomes are measured by questionnaires which can be divided into two parts.
