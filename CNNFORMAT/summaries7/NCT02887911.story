(thirdQuint)Characterization of Adults for Asthma Microbiome Research Studies.

 This is a prospective, observational, two-visit study in which approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled, including healthy controls, atopic controls without asthma, and patients with stable asthma (n = 150).

 Among asthmatics, 2/3 will be on regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy and 1/3 will not be taking inhaled corticosteroids.

 Subjects who meet study criteria will undergo phenotypic characterization in multiple domains, including evaluation of lung function, assessments of asthma/allergy history, asthma triggers, asthma symptom control, environmental microbial exposures and dietary intake.

 Oral rinse, sputum, stool, urine and blood specimens will be collected for microbiome-related analyses, including molecular and culture-based assays, metabolite studies, and to relate these to markers of inflammation and immune function.

 The overall goal is to enroll a cohort of well-characterized asthmatic and non-asthmatic control subjects to enable mechanism-oriented studies of how members of the airway microbiota and possibly also gut microbiota influence phenotypes of adult asthma.

 Characterization of Adults for Asthma Microbiome Research Studies@highlight

The purpose of this study is to characterize adult subjects regarding their history of allergy and asthma, clinical manifestations of asthma, and exposures and conditions that may influence asthma severity and control.

 Assessments include baseline medical history, lung function tests, questionnaires and collection of specimens for phenotypic characterization.
