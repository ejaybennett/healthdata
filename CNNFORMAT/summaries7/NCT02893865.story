(fifthQuint)Evolution of Oxidative Stress in Coronary Patients With Moderate Sleep Apnea Syndrome After Treatment With Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.

 Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent upper airway collapse during sleep and has been associated with worsened prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

 Moderate OSAS can be defined by an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) between 15 and 30 events/hour.

 Pathophysiologic processes are complex and it seems that oxidative stress play and important role.

 Studies showed that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) influence oxidative stress but the results are conflicting.

 Moreover there are uncertainties whether diagnosing and treating OSAS can influence the pathophysiological and clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.

 Therefore, we aim to test the effects of 3 months of CPAP on systemic redox balance evaluated by plasma GSH/GSSG ratio.

 Patients with moderate OSAS will be randomized for the intervention.

 Patients with AHI 30/h will be included in an ancillary study (blood and urinary test, MIBG scintigraphy) to characterize the biological profile of coronary patients based on their AHI.

 For a alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 80%, the study should include 16 patients in each group.

 Taking in account a possible 20% of dropout the study will need to include 20 patients by randomized arm to demonstrate an effect.

Published data indicate that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) worse the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and that oxidative stress can link this 2 diseases.

 Investigators hypothesise that oxidative stress decrease after 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in this specific population.

 The results may have major implication in the comprehension of physiopathologic processes linking OSAS and CAD and in the treatment of OSAS in this specific population.
