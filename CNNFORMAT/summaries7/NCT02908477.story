(fifthQuint)Evaluation of De-escalated Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Associated Oropharynx Cancer.

 Recent studies suggest that tumors in the oropharynx (tonsils or base of tongue) caused by the HPV virus are much more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy.

 Standard treatment for HPV associated oropharynx tumor after surgery involves six weeks of radiation therapy and has many long term side effects and complications.

 Mayo Clinic recently piloted a study investigating whether patients with HPV-associated oropharynx tumors can receive less radiation and chemotherapy after surgery when compared with the standard treatment.

 The investigators current study will compare the new, shorter treatment course (2 weeks of treatment) with the standard course of treatment (six weeks).

 Patients will be randomized to either the less intense or standard treatment arm.

 Patients will be twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.

 Evaluation of De-escalated Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Associated Oropharynx Cancer@highlight

This study is designed for patients with a cancer of the oropharynx (tonsils or base of tongue) caused by the HPV virus.

 Traditional treatment involves surgery followed by six weeks of daily radiation therapy.

 This study investigates a less intense radiation treatment following surgery that uses half the dose of radiation given over two weeks rather than six weeks.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to receive the less intense treatment versus the traditional treatment by coin flip.

 Patients are twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.
