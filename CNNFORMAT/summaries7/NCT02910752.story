(thirdQuint)CLAM Chemotherapy With PBSC Support for Relapsed Patients After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.

 For acute leukemia patients experienced relapse 6 months or less after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the overall outcome is poor.

 In this study, we design a treatment protocol aiming to achieve complete remission for this high-risk group of patients with chemotherapy consisting of Cladribine (5mg/m2), cytarabine (1.

5g/m2) and mitoxantrone (10mg/m2)for 5 days followed by infusion of mobilized peripheral stem cell from the original donor.

 For patients who failed to achieved remission,a second cycles will be given.

 For patients who achieved remission, the post-remission therapy is open depend on patient's intent: consolidation with one more cycle, second allo-HSCT with different donor or continuous DLI.

 CLAM Chemotherapy With PBSC Support for Relapsed Patients After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation@highlight

For acute leukemia patients with early relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the overall outcome is poor.

 In this study, we evaluate the treatment outcome and safety of chemotherapy with Cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone followed by peripheral stem cell support from the original donor.
