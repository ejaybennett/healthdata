(thirdQuint)Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease.

 Numerous lines of evidence suggest that interventions that confer therapeutic benefits for cardiovascular health are also associated with improvements in, or preservation of, cognitive function.

 Many believe "What's good for the heart is good for the brain.

" However, stronge scientific evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis.

 The rrAD study is a 4-arm, multicenter, randomized trial to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training and intensive pharmacological reduction of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance in older adults who have high risk for AD, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family history of dementia or subjective memory complaints.

 Furthermore, rrAD will examine effects of exercise and vascular risk reduction on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

 Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease@highlight

Physical inactivity, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia.

 Importantly, these risk factors are modifiable with lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, or both.

 The rrAD study will determine effects of aerobic exercise training and intensive vascular risk reduction on cognitive performance in older adults who have high risk for AD.
