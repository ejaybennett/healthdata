(firstQuint)18F-FDG PET/CT-based Prognostic Model for Predicting Outcome in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.

 In this study investigators develop a prognostic model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT and test its ability for prognostic value in patients with DLBCL.

 PET/CT scans evaluation using the liver SUVmax as reference.

 Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold (1.

6 fold of liver SUVmax) or new 18F-FDG avid lesions.

 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prognostic model includes PET/CT image, dominant clinical and pathological prognostic factors to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL.
