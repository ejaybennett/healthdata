(secondQuint)Efficacy of Fixed Monthly Dosing of Ranibizumab in Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration.

 PEDs occur in up to 62% of eyes with advanced AMD.

 Numerous treatment options have been employed for PEDs in AMD, including laser therapies and intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies.

 However, eyes with PEDs were excluded from the larger clinical trials that used macular laser, photodynamic therapy, or ranibizumab to treat neovascular AMD; therefore, the efficacy of such options is still unclear for eyes with PEDs in neovascular AMD.

 Additionally, PED lesions have been reported to show less morphological and functional response to anti-VEGF monotherapy than eyes with other CNV lesions subtypes.

 Based on the generally poor prognosis of PEDs and the lack of sufficient data in the literature regarding the effectiveness of fixed monthly dosing of Lucentis(R) (Ranibizumab) therapy, the investigators designed a prospective study to evaluate the effect of intensive fixed monthly dosing of Ranibizumab for the treatment of SRF associated with PED in neovascular AMD which is persistent to previous anti-VEGF monotherapy.

The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of intensive fixed monthly dosing of intravitreal Lucentis(R) (Ranibizumab) for the treatment of SRF and PED in neovascular AMD which is persistent to anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) monotherapy.
