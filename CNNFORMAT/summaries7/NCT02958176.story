(fifthQuint)Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder.

 Women who meet ICD-10-CM diagnostic criteria for FSAD will be recruited and randomized into one of three conditions, HRV biofeedback (n = 25), HRV biofeedback plus autogenic training (n = 25), or wait-list control (n = 15).

 All participants will complete a baseline assessment, during which their resting state HRV and vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) will be measured.

 The participants in the two biofeedback conditions will receive training in HRV biofeedback from the experimenter, and they will be provided with the materials necessary to guide self-practice in HRV biofeedback at home.

 Participants in these two conditions will be instructed to engage in at-home HRV biofeedback (with or without autogenic training) at least 5 times over a period of two weeks, during which they will report levels of arousal in a sexual activity diary.

 Participants in the wait-list control condition will report levels of arousal in a sexual activity diary.

 After two weeks, participants in all three conditions will return to the laboratory, where their physiological and psychological sexual arousal will be measured.

 Over the next two weeks, participants in the two biofeedback conditions will be asked to complete 5 more self-guided biofeedback sessions along with the sexual activity diary.

 Participants in all three conditions will return to the lab for a final assessment to measure post-treatment HRV and VPA levels as well as psychological sexual arousal.

 To our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial of HRV biofeedback in women with sexual arousal problems.

 If the intervention increases arousal in this population, this study may offer a promising cost-effective psychosocial treatment for women with sexual arousal problems.

 Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder@highlight

Low resting heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with sexual arousal problems and overall sexual dysfunction in women.

 Research has indicated that HRV biofeedback leads to increases in HRV as well as improvements in symptoms associated with several psychological disorders, some of which are comorbid with sexual arousal problems in women.

 Autogenic training also facilitates increases in HRV and was recently associated with acute increases in sexual arousal among sexually healthy women.

 The primary aim of the current study is to examine the efficacy of HRV biofeedback, with and without autogenic training, for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).
