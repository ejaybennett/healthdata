(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Impact of a Therapeutic Education Program for Children With Type 1 Diabetes.

 Structuring a therapeutic education program for patients with a chronic disease was the initiative of the French High Health Authority in June 2007.

 The Prevention and Care of Pediatric Obesity and Pediatric Diabetes Organization of Mulhouse is a partner of the Mulhouse Hospital.

 Besides the usual care given at the hospital of Mulhouse for patients with a type 1 diabetes, both organizations also provide therapeutic education to these patients.

 Each therapeutic education program is organized according to the patient's age.

 They can also be organized in a group or individually.

 The aim of the therapeutic education is to help the young patients to cope with diabetes in their daily activities.

 Therapeutic education is known to bring good results for patients with diabetes, but there is no studies in France for children and teens with a type 1 diabetes.

 Evaluation of the Impact of a Therapeutic Education Program for Children With Type 1 Diabetes@highlight

The needs of children and teens with type 1 diabetes are very specific and different from the adults with type 1 diabetes.

 Many organizations such as the World Health Organization or the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, recommend a patient therapeutic education when it comes to children with type 1 diabetes.

 This study aims to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic education program on theoretical knowledge of the disease and also on quality of life, on biological and clinical indicators.
