(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety Study of Ultrasound Bone Strength Device to Measure Calcaneal Bone Strength Index of Human Subjects.

 This study adopt a method of multicenter, open-labeled, self-paired design.

 Each subject will be randomly assigned to two different detective sequence groups.

 In one group, the investigators will detect the same calcaneus of each subject by experimental ultrasound bone strength device firstly and then by control device.

 In another group, the investigators will detect the same calcaneus of each subject by control ultrasound bone strength device firstly and then by experimental device.

 Experimental ultrasound bone strength device is developed by Wuxi Huajian Hengchuang Medical Equipment Science and Technology Co.

, Ltd.

.

 This device's model number is Oste-scan 500A and report number is Z-Y-2009-2014, Z-E-0530-2014(G).

 Control ultrasound bone strength device which has same clinical indications and action mechanism with the experimental one, is manufactured by Osteosys Co.

, Ltd.

.

 This device's model number is SONOST3000.
