(thirdQuint)Improving Symptom Self-management in Adolescents & Young Adults With Cancer.

 Unrelieved symptoms lead to poorer quality of life for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer.

 Strategies are needed to help AYAs manage symptoms.

 The investigators developed the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT), a novel way to assess symptoms where AYAs create a picture of their symptoms using images and text on an iPad app.

 The resulting image shows symptoms/symptom clusters, priority symptoms and relationships between symptoms and has potential to support AYA's symptom self-management.

 Facilitating the self-management process, including self-efficacy, self-regulation behaviors, and patient-provider communication, is essential for improving symptom outcomes.

 Improving Symptom Self-management in Adolescents & Young Adults With Cancer@highlight

This study evaluates the use of the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT), which creates an image of the symptoms the participant is experiencing, for improving symptom self-management in adolescents and young adults with cancer.

 In this one-group trial, participants will complete the C-SCAT and use it during two clinic visits with their oncology providers.
