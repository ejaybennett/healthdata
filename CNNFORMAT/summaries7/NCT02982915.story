(firstQuint)Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs) on Vaccine-Specific Antibody- Response in Subjects With Aging Frailty.

 A pilot phase will consist of a 3 subject safety run-in, followed by 20 subject randomized phase to evaluate influenza vaccine response at 1 week and 4 weeks post infusion of LMSCs.

 This will be followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase.
