 VAS203 on renal function and perfusion in healthy subjects.

 Primary objective: Possible adverse effect of VAS203 on the Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) and the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) during and after 6 hours of constant-rate iv.

 infusion of 10 mg/kg VAS203.

 Secondary objective: To analyse the effects of VAS203 on - filtration fraction - hemodynamics (afferent and efferent resistance, intraglomerular pressure) - markers of kidney injury and renal function - systolic, mean and diastolic brachial blood pressure - Plasma PK of VAS203 and its first metabolite.
