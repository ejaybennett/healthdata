(secondQuint)A Clinical Study to Investigate the Potential Interactions Between Food and ACT-541468 and Between ACT-541468 and Midazolam.

 Food effect will be assessed by comparing the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a single dose of ACT-541468 under fasted (Treatment B) and fed (Treatment C) conditions.

 Potential CYP3A4 inhibiting / inducing effects of ACT-541468 will be assessed by comparing the PK parameters of midazolam alone (Treatment A) and midazolam given with a single dose of ACT-541468 (Treatment B) or with multiple doses of ACT-541468 (Treatment D).

The main objectives of this phase 1 trial are to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (i.

e.

 how long and how much a compound is present in the blood) of ACT-541468 and to evaluate whether ACT-541468 can affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate.
