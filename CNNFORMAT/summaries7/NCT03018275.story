(fifthQuint)Beginning Assessment of Cutaneous Treatment Efficacy of Roseomonas in Atopic Dermatitis.

 The underlying pathology of atopic dermatitis (AD) consists of defective skin barrier function, susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection, and immune imbalance.

 There is currently no cure for AD.

 Preclinical data in a mouse model of AD suggest that commensal Gram-negative bacteria (CGN), such as Roseomonas mucosa, from a healthy source can relieve symptoms of AD and have antimicrobial effects.

 In this study, we will first evaluate the safety of R mucosa-based biotherapy in adults with AD (age 18+ years; part 1), and then evaluate the safety and activity of R mucosa-based biotherapy in children (ages 3-17 years) with AD (parts 2A and 2B).

 In part 1, participants will receive twice-weekly doses of CGN biotherapy for 6 weeks, with dose escalations at 2 and 4 weeks.

 In part 2B, participants will receive twice-weekly doses of either CGN biotherapy or placebo for 4 months, with possible dose escalations at 4 and 8 weeks (part 2A only).

 Starting at 12 weeks for both parts 2A and 2B, dosing frequency may be increased to every other day.

 After completion, participants in the placebo arm will be offered the option for 4 months of active therapy at the same scheme as the active therapy arm (part 2C).

 Participants in part 1 will be contacted 30 10 days after end of treatment for assessment of safety.

 Participants in parts 2A and 2B will also be followed for up to 1 year after the end of treatment for evaluation of long-term activity and safety.

 This will be the first study to test cutaneous live biotherapeutic products for AD.

 We hypothesize that altering the strains of CGN on the skin of people with AD will improve the patient s clinical outcome.

 We do not expect serious toxicities because R mucosa is rarely pathogenic; reported cases of bacteremia have typically been associated with percutaneous catheters in immunocompromised patients, who are excluded from this study.

 Beginning Assessment of Cutaneous Treatment Efficacy of Roseomonas in Atopic Dermatitis@highlight

Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease also called eczema.

 It is common in children and sometimes gets better on its own.

 However, chronic AD may cause asthma, food allergies, eye infections, and sleep problems.

 The cause of AD might be related to bacteria that live on the skin.

 Researchers want to see if introducing bacteria, R mucosa, from healthy skin onto the skin of someone with AD helps treat the disease.

 Objective: To test the safety and activity of R mucosa for treating AD.

 Eligibility: Part 1: People ages 18 and older with AD Part 2: Children ages 3-17 with AD Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Examination of their AD Blood and urine tests At the baseline visit, participants will have blood tests and photos taken of their skin.

 They will get a supply of R mucosa and a memory aid to track their doses and record how they are feeling.

 Part 2 participants guardians will complete questionnaires about their child s AD.

 Part 1 participants will spray R mucosa on their arm twice per week for 6 weeks.

 Part 2 guardians will spray it on their child s arm twice per week for 16 weeks.

 Participants will have follow-up visits to repeat some baseline tests and review their memory aid: Part 1: Six weeks after the baseline visit Part 2: Four times over 16 weeks; then 2 or 3 times for 1 year Participants will be called or emailed to discuss how they are feeling: Part 1: About 30 days after their last visit Part 2: About every 10 days between visits
