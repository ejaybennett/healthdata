(fifthQuint)Pembrolizumab and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the clinical response rate of platinum chemotherapy and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in platinum chemotherapy pretreated ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal.

 II.

 To examine whether retreatment with platinum chemotherapy in platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers improves progression free survival by concurrent administration of MK-3475.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent administration of MK-3475 with platinum chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

 II.

 To determine the relationship between PD-L1 expression and response to the combination of MK-3475 and platinum.

 III.

 To assess the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of MK-3475 and platinum.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To explore changes in gene expression of pre and post treatment tumor samples.

 II.

 To explore whether treatment with MK-3475 and platinum alters soluble factors in sera, peripheral immune responses and immune cell profile.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15.

 Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

 Pembrolizumab and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and carboplatin work in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back or has not responded to previous treatment.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Giving pembrolizumab and carboplatin may work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
