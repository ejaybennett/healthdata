(secondQuint)Assessing the Stability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Plasticity Responses.

 The primary aim of this study is to assess the reliability of TMS plasticity measures recorded one week apart, on healthy individuals.

 The secondary aim is assess TMS plasticity measures on healthy individuals after an acute bout of aerobic exercise.

 Participants will complete 3 visits.

 Visits 1 and 2 comprise TMS plasticity testing, and on visit 3, participants will complete a short bout of aerobic exercise before undergoing TMS plasticity testing.

 Assessing the Stability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Plasticity Responses@highlight

The overall goal of this proposed study is to assess the reliability of plasticity measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interleaved with intermittent theta-burst stimulation plasticity measures and to assess the influence of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on TMS plasticity measures.
