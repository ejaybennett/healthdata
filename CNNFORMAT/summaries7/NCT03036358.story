(secondQuint)Effect of Teledermatology on Length of Hospital Admission, Length of Stay, 30 Day Readmission Rate, and Antibiotic Use in Patients Presenting With Cellulitis vs Pseudocellulitis in an Academic ED Setting.

 The Investigator hope to determine if the implementation of teledermatology in the emergency department (ED) at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is beneficial in diagnosing cases of cellulitis and pseudocellulitis conditions.

 Prior studies have indicated that misdiagnosis may occur in up to 28% of patients in the ED with these conditions.

 Additionally, dermatological consults have been shown to change diagnosis or management of these conditions in more than 60% of the patients examined.

 Without the use of teledermatology, however, a dermatological consult would be prohibitively expensive and take time to obtain.

 The investigator proposes that by utilizing teledermatology in emergency rooms, the investigator can make faster, yet just as accurate, dermatological diagnoses in patients presenting with cellulitis-like symptoms.

 Subsequently, by reducing the number of misdiagnoses, unnecessary use of antibiotics and hospitalizations will also decrease, lowering health care costs and simultaneously providing patients with faster treatment of the actual dermatologic condition.
