(secondQuint)The Relationship Between Vitamin D and Hepatitis B Virus Replication.

 This is a randomized case-control trial.

 A total of 300 HBV carriers with inadequate vitamin D (< 30 ng/mL) level were enrolled.

 They were randomly divided to two groups: one group receiving vitamin D supplement (2000 IU/day) for 2 months and another group as controls.

 The serum vitamin D, HBV DNA and qHBsAg levels were measured at baseline and after vitamin D supplement.

 Whether HBV DNA and qHBsAg have significant change after vitamin D supplement can be determined.
