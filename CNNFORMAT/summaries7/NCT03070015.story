(thirdQuint)The Effects of a Commercially Available Weight Loss Program on Body Weight in Overweight Men and Women.

 A randomized, controlled, parallel study design with two parts (Part A and Part B).

 Study visits include Screening, Randomization, and Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4.

 Week 4 serves also as the closeout study visit for Part A.

 Subjects randomized to the intervention group (i.

e.

, Nutrisystem group) will continue the program for an additional 8 weeks, and include additional study visits at week 8 and 12.

 Eighty-four (N=84) healthy men and women, matched paired for BMI, will be randomized into one of two groups for 28 days (4 weeks): Nutrisystem program or a self-directed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ("DASH").

 All subjects in the Nutrisystem group who complete Part A will continue on the Nutrisystem program for an additional 8 weeks (Part B).

 Daily energy intake targets for each group will include a 1000 kcal/day diet for both women and men during the first week.

 After the first week women will follow a 1200 kcal/day diet and men will follow a 1500 kcal/day diet.

 Subjects with BMI > 40 will add approximately 200 additional calories to their diet each day.

 Body weight and body circumference (Waist, Hip, Chest, Arm & Thigh and Sum of the 5) measures were obtained at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 (Part A).

 And at weeks 8 and 12 for the Nutrisystem group (Part B).

 The Effects of a Commercially Available Weight Loss Program on Body Weight in Overweight Men and Women@highlight

The primary purpose of this study (Part A) is to assess changes in body weight and body circumference parameters that are achievable after 4 weeks on the Nutrisystem program compared to a self-directed diet (i.

e.

 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension or DASH).

 In Part B, subjects on the Nutrisystem program will be given the option to continue the program for another 8 weeks.
