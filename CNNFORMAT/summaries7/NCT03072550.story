(secondQuint)Early Feasibility Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the RenewalNail Plasma Treatment System in Patients With Mild to Moderate Onychomycosis (Fungal Nail).

 The Sponsor has developed the RenewalNail cent plasma treatment system to topically treat fungal infected toenails.

 The goal of the RenewalNail cent therapy is to overcome the shortcomings of both topical and oral therapies by combining the safety of a topical treatment with the efficacy of an oral treatment.

 The primary objective of this early feasibility study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RenewalNail cent plasma treatment system and Protocol in achieving mycological cure for the patient.

 The Protocol calls for three 45-minute treatments performed over a week to achieve mycological cure.

 Mycological cure will be assessed with two consecutive mycological culture tests done over a week.

 Two consecutive negative results will confirm the elimination of fungus causing onychomycosis infection, as recommended by recent FDA guidance.

 There will be no placebo arm in the study.

 Secondary objectives include assessing if the treatment protocol results in clear nail growth for the patient over a 5-month interval.
