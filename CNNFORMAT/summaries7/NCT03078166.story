(fifthQuint)Global Congestive Heart Failure Registry.

 The G-CHF Registry is a prospective global cohort study of approximately 20,000-25,000 HF patients enrolled over approximately 5 years.

 Baseline data will be obtained on demographic and socioeconomic data, clinical and laboratory variables, co-morbidities, biomarkers, echocardiography, HF causes, medication use, management patterns, quality of life, and health systems.

 Six-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month follow-up data will be obtained to document patient outcomes and factors associated with outcomes.

 A sub-study of approximately 4000 patients (a subset of the main study population) will be performed to measure frailty, cognitive and lung function, mental health, medication adherence, patient-reported barriers to care, dietary assessment, and collection of blood and urine samples for central storage and analysis.

 Global Congestive Heart Failure Registry@highlight

Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem worldwide but there is no global HF study that documents demographics, socioeconomic and clinical factors, diagnostic and management patterns, etiology, biomarkers, co-morbidities, treatments, quality of life, barriers to care and outcomes in all parts of the world.

 Such knowledge is essential in the prevention and treatment of this global disease.

 The Global Congestive Heart Failure Registry (G-CHF) is a global registry of approximately 20,000-25,000 HF patients enrolled over approximately 5 years to study these risks and causes of HF.
