(fifthQuint)Implementation of a Self-Help Depression Program Among Orthopedic Patients.

 The present project will be an open-label trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a self-help intervention among a sample of orthopedic patients.

 In addition to monitoring the effectiveness of the Deprexis program on depressive symptoms, the proposed project will assess whether a reduction in depressive symptoms will be associated with improvement on patient reported orthopedic impairment.

 The investigators will enroll 50 adults and the participants will be given the opportunity to participate in 8 weeks of the web-based online Deprexis program.

The proposed study addresses the potential utility of providing an accessible self-help intervention for patients in a medical setting with an estimated diagnosis of MDD.

 Specifically, the study will explore whether a) such an intervention can be effectively implemented in a primary care setting and b) patients originally seeking medical attention for an orthopedic problem will be willing to seek psychological treatment and, c) improvement in depression symptoms will lead to improvement in upper and lower extremity functioning.
