(fifthQuint)Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T Immunotherapy for CD19 Positive Lymphoma.

 This is an open, single-arm,multicenter 2 phase clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) in the treatment of CD19 positive lymphoma.

 The study will be conducted using a phaseI/IIdesign the study will have the following sequential phases: part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and part B (treatment and follow-up).

 The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion.

 The total duration of the study are expected to be approximately 3 years.

 A total of 24 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.

 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T Immunotherapy for CD19 Positive Lymphoma@highlight

This open, single-arm,multicenter 2 phase clinical study will treat the patient who have CD19 positive lymphoma with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour cells modified to express the CD19 protein on the cell surface.

 The study will determine if these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells .

The trial will also study the safety of treatment for CAR-T, how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact on this treatment for survival.
