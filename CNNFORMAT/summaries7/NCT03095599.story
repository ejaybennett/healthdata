(firstQuint)Seasonal Trivalent Inactivated Split Virion Influenza Vaccine Clinical Trial (IVACFLU-S) - PHASE 2/3.

 This is a phase 2/3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 888 adults, ages 18 to 60 years old randomized to receive vaccine or placebo in a 5:1 vaccine:placebo randomization.

 Phase 2 will be conducted at 1 site of Long An (252 subjects).

 Following a determination of safety of vaccine in phase 2 study by Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) review and with approval from Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH), Phase 3 enrollment will commence at 2 sites, Long An (252 subjects) and Dong Nai (384 subjects).

 Safety will be assessed in all Phase 2 and 3 participants through Day 91.

 Safety data till Day 8 post-vaccination from the phase 2 study will be presented to Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) for evaluation and an interim report will be filed with local institutional review board (IRB) and MOH.

 Immunogenicity will be assessed only in Phase 3 participants.

 Blood samples will be collected in a subset of 252 individuals randomized at one of the study sites to get evaluable samples from at least 200 vaccine recipients (100 each from both age groups) and 40 placebo recipients (20 each from both age groups) 21 days after vaccination.

 Approximate participant distribution based on age, study arm and study will be as follows: Age group: Phase 2 will have 2 age groups (18-45; 46-60).

 In each age group, 105 subjects will receive IVACFLU-S and 21 subjects will receive Placebo, resulting in 126 subjects total per age group.

 Phase 3 will have 2 age groups (18-45; 46-60).

 In each age group, 265 subjects will receive IVACFLU-S and 53 subjects will receive Placebo, resulting in 318 subjects total per age group.

 Hypotheses: Safety: A single dose of seasonal trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine (IVACFLU-S) will be safe and well tolerated in adults 18 to 60 years of age.

 Immunogenicity: A single dose of seasonal trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine (IVACFLU-S) will induce immune responses to each of the three vaccine antigens to meet one or both age group specific Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH) licensure requirements.

 The criteria for 18-45 year olds for HAI seroprotection (HAI 1:40) is 70%; for 46-60 year olds is 60%.

 The criteria for seroconversion for 18-45 year olds is 40%; for 46-60 year olds is 30%.

 The criteria for HAI GMT increase for 18-45 year olds is 2.

5 times; for 46-60 year olds is 2.
