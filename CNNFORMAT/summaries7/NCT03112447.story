(firstQuint)Treatment of Medial Humeral Epicondyle Fractures in Children With Absorbable Cartilage Nails.

 From August 2007 to January 2012, 32 patients undergoing surgery for medial humeral epicondyle fractures in our hospital were randomized into group A (traditional Kirschner wire) or group B (absorbable cartilage nail).

 The same surgical team performed the operations, and patients were followed for over a year.

 Group A had open reduction with K-wire fixation, and group B was fixed with absorbable cartilage nails.

 The Bede scoring system was used to evaluate elbow function at follow-up.
