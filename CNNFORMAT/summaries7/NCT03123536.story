(thirdQuint)Use of Point-of-care Ultrasound in High Risk Surgical Patients.

 Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly established as a useful bedside tool when performed by the anesthesiologist for evaluation of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other emergent situations.

 However, it remains unclear whether use of perioperative point-of-care ultrasound can reduce the worse postoperative outcomes in high surgical risk patients.

 Patients were randomly allocated to two groups.

 In the point-of-care ultrasound group, treatment was oriented by the findings of point-of-care ultrasound, while in the control group the decisions about the management of patients were made by the experience of the clinical team.

 The primary outcome measures were hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcome measures were the complications and length of hospital stay.

 Use of Point-of-care Ultrasound in High Risk Surgical Patients@highlight

There is currently a lack of evidence to support the use of perioperative point-of-care ultrasound to assess the outcomes in high risk surgical patients.

 Thus, the purposes of this study were to evaluate whether perioperative use of point-of-care ultrasound can reduce the worse postoperative outcomes in high surgical patients.
