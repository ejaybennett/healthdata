(thirdQuint)Vein Fitness System vs Compressive Therapy for Venous Ulcers: a Bayesian Adaptive Trial.

 This is a Bayesian adaptive, randomized, controlled, parallel, two-armed Bayesian adaptive trial.

 Patients diagnosed with varicose ulcers through Doppler ultrasonography will be recruited at the Pro Circulation Clinic of Angiology and Vascular Surgery, Brazil.

 The active group will be the Vein Fitness system, a multimodal intervention comprising exercise, lymphatic drainage, and compressive therapy, while the control group will be standard compressive therapy and regular wound care.

 The researchers will measure closure of the wounds and the closure rate as the primary outcomes.

 The study was designed in accordance with the CONSORT statement.

 Vein Fitness System vs Compressive Therapy for Venous Ulcers: a Bayesian Adaptive Trial@highlight

The objective of this Bayesian Adaptive trial is to compare a control group versus a comprehensive ulcer healing protocol.

 The latter involves a combination of compressive therapy, miokinetic drainage and muscle strengthening for the entire lower extremity pump among patients with lower extremity venous ulcers.

 The investigators hypothesized that the combined therapy will have a higher closure rate as well as lower time to closure.
