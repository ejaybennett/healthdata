(secondQuint)Olanzapine for the Treatment of Chronic Nausea and/or Vomiting in Advanced Cancer Patients.

 Patients with advanced cancer experience a variety of physical and psychosocial symptoms that significantly affect the patients' quality of life.

 Chronic nausea is a particularly distressing symptom present in >60% of patients with advanced cancer.

 A number of palliative care studies have evaluated treatments of nausea with limited success.

 Olanzapine with its unique formulation and decreased drug interactions compared to many other drugs appears to be a reasonable candidate for further evaluation.

 Olanzapine has significant potential for use in the prevention and treatment of nausea in a palliative care setting with a once-daily dosing.
