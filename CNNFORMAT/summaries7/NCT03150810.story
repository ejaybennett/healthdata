(firstQuint)Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Clinical Activity of BGB-290 in Combination With Temozolomide (TMZ) in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

 This is an open-label study of BGB-290 and temozolomide (TMZ) with a dose escalation and dose expansion phase.

 Dose escalation will evaluate safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for the two drug combination.

 It is a modified 3+3 dose escalation scheme with a fixed dose of BGB-290 in combination with escalating doses of TMZ.

 Dose expansion will evaluate the safety, PK profile and anti-tumor activity of BGB-290 and TMZ at a dose/schedule selected from the dose escalation phase.

 Five different solid malignancy types (n=100) will be evaluated.
