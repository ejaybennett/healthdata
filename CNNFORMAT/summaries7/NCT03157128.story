(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Study of LOXO-292 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, RET-Fusion Lung Cancer and Medullary Thyroid Cancer.

 The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).

 During Part 1, patients with advanced NSCLC, advanced MTC or other advanced solid tumors are initially eligible if the tumor has progressed following or has not adequately responded to standard therapy, or if the patient is intolerant of, unlikely to benefit from or refuses standard therapy.

 During Part 2, patients with NSCLC, MTC or other advanced solid tumor that harbors a RET gene alteration or other evidence of increased RET activity are eligible.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LOXO-292 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors, including RET-fusion non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other tumors with increased RET activity.
