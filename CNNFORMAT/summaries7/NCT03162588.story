(thirdQuint)Multiple Burrhole Therapy With Erythropoietin for Unstable Moyamoya.

 This is a investigator led, single-center, single arm, interventional trial in prospective Moyamoya disease (MMD) and Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) registry.

 MMD or MMS patients with acute neurological presentation such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are eligible.

 After inclusion, initial evaluation including transfemoral angiography is performed.

 A 3 day pre-procedure IV erythropoietin (120000 international units[IU] #3) is given for promotion of arteriogenesis, than multiple burrhole procedure is performed.

 Arteriogenesis is evaluated by 6 month transfemoral angiography.

 Multiple Burrhole Therapy With Erythropoietin for Unstable Moyamoya@highlight

In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the indirect revascularization outcomes of a new combination therapy of multiple burrhole procedure with promotion of arteriogenesis by intravenous (IV) erythropoietin (EPO) pretreatment on Moyamoya patients with acute neurological presentation, and outline the clinical and vascular factors associated with revascularization through the burrholes.
