(secondQuint)Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Long-Acting Injectable Cabotegravir Compared to Daily Oral TDF/FTC for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in HIV-Uninfected Women.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting injectable integrase inhibitor cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a population of sexually active HIV-uninfected women at risk for HIV.

 This study will take place in three steps.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm A: Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB and TDF/FTC placebo for 5 weeks.

 Step 2: Participants will receive injections of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter and daily TDF/FTC placebo beginning at Week 5.

 Arm B: Step 1: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and oral CAB placebo for 5 weeks.

 Step 2: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and intramuscular (IM) placebo injections at two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter beginning at Week 5.

 Step 2 will continue until the last enrolled participant reaches approximately 76 weeks on Step 2 (Week 81 for the last enrolled participant).

 In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily TDF/FTC for up to 48 weeks, starting no later than 8 weeks after the last injection.

 At the end of Step 3, all participants will then transition to locally available HIV prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available.

 Study visits will occur at Day 0 and at Weeks 2 and 4 during Step 1.

 During Step 2, participants will attend up to 24 visits, depending on when they enroll in the study.

 Study visits will occur every 12 weeks during Step 3.

 Study visits may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and vaginal swab collection; risk reduction, adherence counseling, and contraception counseling.
