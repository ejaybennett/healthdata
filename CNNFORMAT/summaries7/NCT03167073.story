(fifthQuint)Impact of a Smartphone Application on Postpartum Weight Loss and Breastfeeding Rates Among Low-income, Urban Women.

 Breastfed babies have fewer childhood infections than formula-fed babies, and women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and increased rates of postpartum weight loss.

 Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends six months of exclusive breastfeeding after birth.

 Nationally, 75% of women initiate breastfeeding, but only 59% of Black women, 53% of teenagers, and 66% of women in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children breastfeed.

 Unpublished internal data suggest that, while the breastfeeding initiation rate for women receiving prenatal care at Barnes-Jewish Hospital's Medicaid clinic is higher than the national average (89%), by postpartum day #2, only 34% exclusively breastfeed.

 Reasons for this precipitous decline in breastfeeding are not fully understood but include misconceptions about breastfeeding benefits and poor social support.

 This study would be the first-ever randomized controlled trial describing the impact that a smart phone application (app) has on breastfeeding rates and thus postpartum weight loss among low-income women.

 In this study's first phase, a previously well-validated questionnaire was used to identify barriers that low-income urban women perceived as preventing breastfeeding initiation or continuation.

 In the second phase, these data-as well as input from neonatologists, certified lactation consultants, and focus groups of low-income pregnant women-were used to create a smart phone application (app) to promote breastfeeding called Breastfeeding Friend (BFF).

 The investigators chose an app to provide breastfeeding support for two reasons.

 First, nearly two-thirds of American adults, and 90% of those under the age of 29, have smart phones.

 Second, more than two-thirds of Americans with smart phones use them to obtain health information via new media (blogs, websites, and apps).

 Among low-income women, physician-designed new media have improved intrauterine device uptake rates and decreased rates of postpartum smoking.

 BFF will serve as a virtual lactation consultant, increasing breastfeeding knowledge while providing interactive assistance and access to in-person resources.

 By providing women with more breastfeeding support, this app could increase postpartum weight loss by decreasing a significant health disparity.

Breastfed babies have significant health benefits extending beyond infancy, including lower rates of childhood obesity and infection.

 Mothers who breastfeeding also have health benefits, including increased rates of postpartum weight loss.

 Low-income women are less likely to breastfeed comparatively; this disparity may be due to misconceptions about breastfeeding benefits or poor social support.

 Based on survey results and focus groups of low-income women, the investigators designed a novel smart-phone application to confront barriers women perceived prevented them from breastfeeding and propose the first-ever randomized controlled trial describing the impact a smart phone app has on postpartum weight loss and breastfeeding rates among low-income women.
