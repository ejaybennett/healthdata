(firstQuint)Study of the Safety and Efficacy of MIW815 With PDR001 to Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors or Lymphomas.

 This is a Phase Ib, multi-center, open-label study to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of MIW815(ADU-S100) in combination with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor PDR001.

 Two different schedules will be explored in two dose escalation groups in accessible cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions, as well as an optional dose confirmation group exploring intratumoral injection of viscerally located lesions.

 Group A will include patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas.

 This group will receive a fixed dose of PDR001 i.

v.

 on day 1 of every 28 day cycle and intratumoral injections of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 day cycle.

 Group B will include patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas.

 This group will receive a fixed dose of PDR001 i.

v.

 on day 1 of every cycle and an intratumoral injection of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on day 1 of every cycle.

 Once the dose and dose schedule has been confirmed, the dose expansion part of the study will open.

 The main purpose of the expansion part is to further assess the safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity, of the study treatment at the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for expansion.
