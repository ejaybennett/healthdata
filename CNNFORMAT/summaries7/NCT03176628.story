(thirdQuint)Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of Basis in Acute Kidney Injury Study.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common, growing in incidence, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

 Sirtuins are anti-aging enzymes that play a diverse role in cellular energy metabolism and gene regulation.

 Mice deficient in SIRT1 are more susceptible to developing AKI and sirtuin activation is a potential treatment for AKI.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stepwise study of escalating doses of Basis (NR/pterostilbene) in patients with AKI.

 The study will potentially comprise up to four Steps.

 The purpose of the stepwise approach is to identify the dose of Basis that achieves at least a 50% and up to 100% increase in white blood cell (WBC) content of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) without side-effects.

 During each Step, Basis (5 patients) or placebo (1 patient) will be given twice a day for 2 days.

 Patients will have frequent blood sampling performed for a 24 hour period following dosing on Day 1 and then at 48 hr.

 The measurements in blood will include NR/pterostilbene blood concentrations and NAD+ and NAAD (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) concentrations in WBCs.

 Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of Basis in Acute Kidney Injury Study@highlight

This study will determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of escalating doses of Basis following twice daily oral administration in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

 Basis is a commercially available nutritional supplement consisting of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and pterostilbene that acts to increase sirtuin activity.
