(fifthQuint)High-Intensity Parent Intervention Program in Improving Learning and School Functioning in Latino Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the effectiveness of an enhanced parenting intervention, high-intensity intervention program (HIP), on pediatric cancer survivors' learning and school health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes up to 12 months post enrollment.

 II.

 Determine the effectiveness of HIP on the "pro-learning" efficacy of parents of pediatric cancer survivors up to 12 months post enrollment.

 III.

 Examine the extent to which the parent's increases in personal efficacy and use of "pro-learning" behaviors correlate with the child's school HRQOL and academic performance.

 OUTLINE: Parents or caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Parents or caregivers attend standard of care lower intensity intervention program (LIP) consisting of a meeting to review results of a neurocognitive evaluation and to discuss recommendations for optimal learning and school performance for 1 session.

 ARM II: Parents or caregivers attend HIP consisting of individual parental skill training sessions with a bilingual therapist over 60-90 minutes every 2 weeks for a total of 8 sessions.

 After study enrollment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

 High-Intensity Parent Intervention Program in Improving Learning and School Functioning in Latino Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Lymphoblastic Lymphoma@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies how well a high-intensity intervention parenting program works in improving learning and school functioning in Latino children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or lymphoblastic lymphoma.

 A high-intensity intervention program may help doctors to see whether training parents or caregivers in specific parenting skills and "pro-learning" behaviors will result in better learning and school outcomes for Latino children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or lymphoblastic lymphoma.

 It is not yet known if a high-intensity intervention program is more beneficial than a standard of care lower intensity parenting intervention.
