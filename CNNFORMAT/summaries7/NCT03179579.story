(fifthQuint)Efficacy of HIPEC Combined With Systemic Chemotherapy and CRS on Peritoneal Metastases From Gastric Cancer.

 Peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer are considered as terminal disease with poor prognosis, the median survival time of this kind of patients is less than 1 year and even worse in China.

 Recently, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in patients with peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer.

 Even though the REGATTA trial demonstrated that the removal of the primary tumor is not necessarily beneficial, the role of operation aiming at R0 resection combined with new regimens like HIPEC and new chemotherapeutic agents is still confusing.

 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prolonged OS of patients received macroscopically radical (CC0) surgery.

 Compared to systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC promotes chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue, which needed multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to comfirm.

 Therefore, we has conducting prospective phase III trial of HIPEC combined with systemic chemotherapy and CRS for gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.

 Efficacy of HIPEC Combined With Systemic Chemotherapy and CRS on Peritoneal Metastases From Gastric Cancer@highlight

This project is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical observation the safety and efficacy that stage IV limited peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer patients accept hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CRS and systemic chemotherapy.

 With advanced-stage gastric patients of confined to the peritoneal as the research object, with median progression-free survival and overall survival, adverse events as the end points.
