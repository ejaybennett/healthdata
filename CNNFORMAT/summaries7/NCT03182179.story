(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Ondansetron in LARS Treatment.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study aimed at testing the efficacy of Ondansetron in the low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) occurring as a consequence of surgery for rectal cancer.

 Patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either 4 weeks of Ondansetron followed by 4 weeks of placebo (O-P sequence) or 4 weeks of placebo followed by 4 weeks of Ondansetron (P-O sequence).

 Neither the investigator nor the patient will be aware of the sequence (O-P or P-O) assigned to the patient.

 One week will elapse between the end of the first treatment and start of the second treatment.

 The hypothesis to be tested is that 4 weeks of oral Ondansetron at the dose of 4mg BID induce a variation of the LARS Score at least 7 points (20%) greater than the variation occurring after 4 weeks of placebo.

 The sample size calculated for the primary analysis is 38 evaluable patients.

 Considering an expected attrition rate of about 20%, it is expected to enrol approximately 46 patients in total.

Patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either 4 weeks of Ondansetron followed by 4 weeks of placebo (O-P sequence) or 4 weeks of placebo followed by 4 weeks of Ondansetron (P-O sequence).

 It will be one week of washout between the two treatments.

 During the treatment questionnaires will be completed by the patients to evaluate the efficacy of the study treatment and the quality of live.
