(fifthQuint)iLook Out for Child Abuse: An Innovative Learning Module for Childcare Providers.

 This 5-year study will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative educational intervention, iLook Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut) for increasing rates of accurate child abuse reporting.

 Grounded in an Experiential Learning conceptual model, iLookOut is a multi-media, online intervention that engages learners emotionally and intellectually through an interactive, video-based story-line that provides education, challenges learners with decision-points, and gives critical feedback.

 iLookOut uses "gamification" strategies to promote experiential learning through simulation, problem-solving, and practice opportunities to apply new information and understanding.

 It also will include follow-up activities that promote retention and integration of new knowledge, as well as help CCPs to remain aware and engaged.

 Prior studies have demonstrated that iLookOut significantly improves CCP knowledge and attitudes about reporting suspected child abuse, and is very well received by CCPs.

 To evaluate its impact on actual reporting behavior, the proposed research will randomize CCP sites in southern Maine (total = ~1,300) to receive iLookOut, Standard training, or Control (no intervention).

 The primary goal is to increase the number of CCP reports for which either child abuse is confirmed or social services (e.

g.

, therapeutic services, nutritional assistance) are recommended -as these are the kinds of reports that are likely to actually benefit a child.

 The secondary goal is to decrease the proportion of reports that don't offer such benefit, and in particular to decrease costs to the state associated with intake and investigation of non-beneficial reports.

 iLook Out for Child Abuse: An Innovative Learning Module for Childcare Providers@highlight

This five-year study aims to improve childcare provider (CCP) reporting of suspected child abuse by means of an online learning module, iLook Out for Child Abuse.

 Using an interactive, video-based story-line (along with follow-up activities), iLookOut engages CCPs emotionally and intellectually to take the first step in addressing the epidemic of child abuse -which in the U.

S.

 claims >680,000 confirmed victims annually.

 The consequences of child abuse can be devastating and long-lasting.

 The purpose of this study is to establish an evidence-based intervention that can help those who care for young children recognize and report suspected child abuse before irreparable harm occurs.
