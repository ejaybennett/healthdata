(firstQuint)The Effect of Chlorohexidine Gel on Tissue Healing Following Surgical Exposure of Dental Implants.

 Patients who received implants in our department, and scheduled for surgical uncovering of the implants will be asked to participate in this clinical trial (40) Patients from Department of periodontology, Rambam Health campus, Haifa in Israel will be recruited to Randomized clinical trial; patients will be divided randomly in to 2 groups: 1.

 Control: following uncovering of the implant a 4 mm height healing abutment will be screwed to the implant (the standard treatment modality) without using Chlorohexidine gel or any other gel.

 2.

 Test group: following implant exposure this group will receive Chlorohexidine 1% gel (Corsodyl(R)) the gel will be applied on the abutment as well as on the implant internal hex and then a 4 mm healing abutment will be connected.
