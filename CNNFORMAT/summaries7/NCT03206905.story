(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Sustained Weight Loss of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty With Diet Modification and Exercise.

 This is a single center, prospective randomized case control study with an additional non randomized case arm.

 This study includes two research interventional groups.

 Groups A: ESG with diet and exercise modules.

 Group B: Diet and exercise modules only.

 We propose to compare ESG to behavioral modification including diet and exercise for patients who have a BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 with 1 or more obesity related co-morbidity and who cannot undergo conventional bariatric surgery(or decline the surgical option).

 We will also compare the effects of ESG to diet and exercise on comorbidities such as diabetes, sleep apnea and high cholesterol as well as the various obesity related hormones.

 Safety, Tolerability, and Sustained Weight Loss of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty With Diet Modification and Exercise@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) with diet and exercise, to diet and exercise alone, to see which is better in weight loss reduction.

 We will also compare the effects of ESG to diet and exercise comorbidities such as diabetes, sleep apnea and high cholesterol as well as the various obesity related hormones.
