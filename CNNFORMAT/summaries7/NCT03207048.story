(firstQuint)A Study of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Bipolar Patients.

 Cognitive deficits are core features of bipolar disorder.

 Preliminary evidence shows that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) might have positive effects in enhancing cognition and improving clinical symptoms in patients with depression.

 This study will investigate the effect of rTMS on cognition and long-term outcomes (12 month) of bipolar patients.
