(secondQuint)Reliability of Fluorescent Camera in Diagnosis of Occlusal Carious Lesion.

 A total of 43 volunteer patients will be assigned in this study.

 Each patient must have at least two occlusal carious lesions.

 Each lesion will be evaluated by three diagnostic methods (D), where D1 represents light induced fluorescence camera, D2 represents Caries detection dye.

 And D3 represents visual assessment method (ICDAS criteria).
