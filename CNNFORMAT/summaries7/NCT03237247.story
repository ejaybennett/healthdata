(fifthQuint)Role of Complete Blood Picture in Predicting the Etiology of Extrahepatic Cholestasis.

 Extrahepatic cholestasis has various etiologies including benign causes (benign stricture, chronic pancreatitis, choledochal cyst, mirizzi syndrome, etc.

), choledocholithiasis, malignant causes (cancer pancreas, gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, etc.

.

.

.

), parasitic infestations (fasciola hepatica, ascaris lumbricoides, etc.

) and other causes.

 it is essential to detect the exact cause of extrahepatic cholestasis in order to determine treatment options.

 diagnosing such conditions depends on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, biopsy and even surgical intervention.

 some of these investigations are expensive, not available, or carry risk to the patients.

 moreover non of them is accurate 100%.

 Complete blood count is already available, easy to obtain, not invasive investigation.

 In these study we are trying to evaluate the role of complete blood count parameters namely RDW, MPV, PDW, PCT, NLR, PLR in the differential diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis.

 Role of Complete Blood Picture in Predicting the Etiology of Extrahepatic Cholestasis@highlight

Cases with extrahepatic cholestasis are common and faced during day to day clinical practice, however reaching the final etiology is sometimes challenging and needs investigations which are usually expensive, may carry hazards to the patients, or inaccessible so we are in need for a method which is easily available, affordable and safe for aiding in the differential diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis.

 our study aiming to evaluate the role of complete blood count in predicting the etiology of extrahepatic cholestasis.
