(fifthQuint)Clinical Evaluation of the OncAlert RAPID in Subjects Presenting for Evaluation and/or Initial Biopsy; Impact on Decision-Making.

 Overview The OncAlert Oral Cancer RAPID Test (OncAlert RAPID) is a qualitative point-of-care lateral flow assay to aid in the decision to biopsy in patients with clinical features associated with oral potentially malignant disorders and or oral/oropharyngeal cancer (i.

e.

 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma).

 Proposed Intended Use Statement The device measures soluble CD44 and total protein in saliva samples collected in saline.

 The test is an adjunct to the biopsy decision process, and not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay.

 To be used in adults 23 years and older.

 Not intended for use in pregnant women.

 STUDY OBJECTIVES The principal objectives of this study are to: - Validate the OncAlert RAPID Test, with an NPV (1-prevalence), - Evaluate OncAlert RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), to assess impact on outcome, - Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical variables including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and alcohol use with the biopsy and test results.

 STUDY OVERVIEW Study Approach Prospectively collect 5cc of normal saline after a combination of swish, gargle and spit into the provided collection specimen cup.

 1cc will be removed and sequestered for subsequent downstream analyses (Section 7).

 Specimens will be collected at baseline (time of biopsy) as per standard practice at each site.

 The OncAlert RAPID Test cassette is inserted into the specimen cup and read directly from the cassette in 10 minutes.

 In addition, acquire comprehensive clinical - pathology and patient demographic features including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and all pathology biopsy results.

 Also, obtain any pertinent additional clinical data including HPV status, socioeconomic status, smoking, drinking history, and pertinent features related to oral health.

 It is presumed that some patients within the current biopsy protocol will undergo treatment as a result of the biopsy diagnosis.

 The clinical-pathology data, when accessible, for these patients will be collected for subsequent secondary analyses.

 A central pathology review for all biopsy results will be performed and incorporated into the final analyses.

 Study Duration Cohorts 1a and 1b patients will be followed until pathology of clinically directed incisional / diagnostic biopsy pathology report is received.

 Cohort 2 patients not having an initial incisional / diagnostic biopsy will have an additional OncAlert RAPID test performed within 1-3 months of initial visit as per clinical indications and followed as per 7.

2.

1, specifically if a biopsy is performed.

 It is anticipated that the study will continue up to 1.

5-years to collect all pertinent clinical information on enrolled subjects.

 Clinical Evaluation of the OncAlert RAPID in Subjects Presenting for Evaluation and/or Initial Biopsy; Impact on Decision-Making@highlight

Objectives Validate the OncAlert RAPID Test, with an NPV (1-prevalence).

 Evaluate the independent and associated contribution of readily available clinical variables including age, race, gender, HPV status, socioeconomic level, tobacco, and alcohol use with the biopsy and test results.

 Evaluate OncAlert RAPID Test results in patients without immediate biopsy, both at baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), to assess impact on outcome.

 Planned Number of Subjects 800 patients will be followed until pathology of clinically directed incisional / diagnostic biopsy pathology report is received.

 An additional 200 'non-biopsy subjects' will be followed then re-evaluated during a 1-3 month clinic visit.

 Additional follow up of subject data may continue for up to 2 years.

 Patient Population Cohorts 1a and 1b: Subjects with a clinical suspicion of oral potentially malignant disorders, oral or oropharyngeal cancer, or both based in part on clinical examination, symptoms, clinical history, suspicious lesion(s) in mouth without history of a prior biopsy.

 - Cohort 1a: oral cavity - Cohort 1b: oropharynx Cohort 2: Subjects with clinically indicated suspicion of disease but without immediate biopsy, both at baseline and scheduled follow-up visit (approximately 1-3 months), Screen Fail Rate A 20% Screen Fail Rate is anticipated.
