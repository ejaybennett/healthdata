(fifthQuint)A Pancreatic Cancer Screening Study in High Risk Individuals Including Those With New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus.

 Individuals between 50-80 years of age who have developed diabetes mellitus within the preceding year or who have a family history of pancreatic cancer will be recruited through the offices of primary care physicians and endocrinologists.

 Those meeting initial criteria will meet with a research nurse and will undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility.

 Individuals enrolled in the study will undergo a ten-minute psychological survey and donation of a blood sample for bio-bank analysis every 6 months for 3 years.

 MRI will be performed annually for 3 years (4 in total).

 Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed with the participant.

 The costs of MRI will be covered by the study.

The main goal of this study is to explore the relationship between new-onset diabetes mellitus and a subsequent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions.

 Individuals with a strong family history or genetic predisposition to pancreatic cancer will also be included.

 Participants will be asked to donate a blood sample at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the development of a blood based screening test for Pancreatic Cancer.
