(fifthQuint)GoalTracker: Comparing Self-Monitoring Strategies for Weight Loss.

 This study will examine whether a digital health intervention (GoalTracker) can promote weight loss among adults who are overweight or obese.

 Engagement in self-monitoring often declines over time, which is then associated with suboptimal weight loss.

 Finding ways to improve self-monitoring engagement, particularly in the first month of treatment, is needed.

 Promoting mastery, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory skills may help with maintaining high engagement.

 The investigators aim to enroll 105 participants.

 All groups are asked to self-monitor daily on their smartphone using the free commercial mobile application MyFitnessPal over the course of the 12-week intervention.

 Specifically, the study aims to.

.

.

 1.

 Determine the effect of a Sequential self-monitoring intervention, compared to a Simultaneous self-monitoring intervention on weight change, caloric intake change, and proportion of individuals achieving 5% weight loss.

 2.

 Determine the effect of the Sequential self-monitoring intervention, compared to the Control, on the same variables.

 3.

 Compare self-monitoring engagement by intervention arm.

 4.

 Examine the relation between self-monitoring engagement and weight loss.

 5.

 Investigate theoretical mediators (self-efficacy, mastery, and self-regulation) on the relation between treatment arm and weight change.

 GoalTracker: Comparing Self-Monitoring Strategies for Weight Loss@highlight

This study is a randomized controlled trial that compares 3 self-monitoring approaches for weight loss.

 GoalTracker is a standalone, technology-based intervention using a commercial smartphone app (MyFitnessPal) and email.

 The investigators hypothesize that the group that delays diet tracking and receives additional intervention components (weekly personalized feedback, skills training, and action plans) will have greater weight loss at the end of the 12-week intervention and at 6-month followup, compared to (a) an intervention group that simultaneously tracks weight and diet for all 12 weeks and receives the same additional components, and (b) a control group that tracks only diet.
