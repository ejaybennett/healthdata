(thirdQuint)ICT-based Monitoring for Arrhythmia Detection After AF Ablation.

 This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study in patients who are capable of using and consent to use a smartphone-based ECG monitoring after ablation for atrial fibrillation.

 The patients will be randomly assigned to either the Holter monitoring or ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system group in a 1:1 ratio and will undergo monitoring from immediately after the procedure to 12 months after discharge.

 ICT-based Monitoring for Arrhythmia Detection After AF Ablation@highlight

To compare the efficacy and stability of an ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system against the efficacy and stability of an existing outpatient-based electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitoring system for arrhythmia detection after atrial fibrillation ablation, and to test whether such continuous monitoring can better detect arrhythmia that is undetectable by existing methods and how this may affect treatment outcomes
