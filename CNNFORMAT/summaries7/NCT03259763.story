(fifthQuint)EUS-GE vs ES for Palliation of GOO.

 In recent years, Enteral Stenting (ES) has commonly been used as the first line management of unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction.

 On the other hand, Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) is the most recently described technique for palliation of malignant GOO, which has the theoretical potential to minimize the risk for stent occlusion while maintaining the less invasive endoscopic approach.

 This novel endoscopic treatment entails creating a gastroenterostomy under EUS-guidance thereby bypassing the occluded lumen.

 This endoscopic technique has been performed to treat patients with GOO since 2014, and recent retrospective studies have shown that EUS-GE was comparable to ES in terms of efficacy and safety; however, EUS-GE was associated with a significantly decreased risk of recurrent GOO and reinterventions.

 Based on the investigator's clinical experience for the last three years and the above-mentioned study results, the goal of this study is to prospectively compare EUS-GE with ES in the management of unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction.

 The investigators hypothesize that EUS-GE is associated with comparable technical and clinical success and safety profile while requiring fewer re-interventions.

 EUS-GE vs ES for Palliation of GOO@highlight

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a common complication of luminal malignancies which is associated with substantial morbidity.

 Palliation of GOO has traditionally been through the surgical bypass of the obstructed lumen by creating an opening between the stomach and small intestine.

 However, In recent years, a less invasive approach, i.

e.

 endoscopic stenting, has gained wide acceptance to treat unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction.

 In this study, the investigators are going to compare the safety and efficacy of the two different endoscopic techniques including Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) and enteral stenting (ES).
