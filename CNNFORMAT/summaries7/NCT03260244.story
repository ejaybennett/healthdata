(thirdQuint)EnSite Precision Observational Study.

 The EnSite Precision cent Cardiac Mapping System is a newly developed system that introduces features such as Delayed Enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DE-MRI) image integration, lesion marking automaticity, automatic mapping, and workflow flexibility to aid in the success of complex ablation procedures.

 Utilization of this system in the treatment of complex ablation procedures and its impact on patient outcomes is not well characterized.

 This clinical study is designed to collect a broad range of usage scenarios, therefore this clinical study has limited patient selection criteria and data collection is focused on EnSite Precision cent Cardiac Mapping System usage and patient outcomes.

 The data collected from the procedure (performed per Instructions For Use (IFU) and per standard practice of the physician) as well as the 12 month follow up period enables the Sponsor to review the system's standard practice usage.

 This information will be added to the current knowledge and understanding of treatment options for patients with arrhythmias, which can assist the Sponsor to provide future recommendations for best practices to improve patient outcomes.

 EnSite Precision Observational Study@highlight

This document is a clinical investigation plan (CIP) for the EnSite Precision Observational Study.

 This clinical study is intended to quantify and characterize the usage of the EnSite Precision cent Cardiac Mapping System (Software version 2.

0.

1 or higher) in a real-world environment.

 This study will be conducted in patients who are indicated for a cardiac electrophysiological (EP) mapping and radio frequency ablation procedure using a three-dimensional system.
