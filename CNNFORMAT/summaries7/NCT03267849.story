(firstQuint)Lamina Cribrosa Depth Change With Change in Eye Pressure.

 Glaucoma patients and control subjects will have their internal eye structure (lamina cribrosa) imaged by optical coherence tomography (OCT) standard images at two different eye pressures.

 In some participants, the eye pressure will be changed by having the subject drink one liter of tap water quickly with imaging 30 minutes later.
