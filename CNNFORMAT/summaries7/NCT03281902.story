(fifthQuint)Genetic Analysis in Blood and Tumor Samples From Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive and HER2 Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Palbociclib and Endocrine Therapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Identify novel genomic variants and pathways associated with early progression (progression within 12 months) among women with advanced hormone positive breast cancer treated with palbociclib and endocrine therapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess whether time to progression differs with respect to SNAIL expression and other markers of EMT.

 II.

 To assess whether time to progression differs with respect to genetic alterations known to be associated with endocrine monotherapy resistance (e.

g.

 ESR1 mutations/fusions, AKT, HER2, estrogen receptor [ER]alpha, etc.

).

 III.

 To tabulate the number of patients who have targetable mutations found in the baseline tumor and assess their subsequent treatment regimen following progression on palbociclib and endocrine therapy.

 IV.

 To assess whether time to progression differs with respect to biomarkers associated with the CD44high/CD24/low/ERlow cancer stem cell-like phenotype, ERalpha downregulation and resistance to endocrine therapy and palbociclib [expression of total and phosphorylated AURKA, breast cancer stemness biomarkers (CD44, CD24, ALDH1) EMT transcription factors (SMAD5, SOX2), cyclin E, cyclin A and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb)].

 V.

 To generate patient derived xenograft (PDX)s from the baseline tumor biopsy (Rochester only) test novel endocrine therapy combinations in PDXs generated from the baseline tumor biopsy.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare and contrast the spectrum of ESR1 mutations identified in tissue, circulating cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA), and circulating tumor cell (CTC) derived DNA.

 II.

 To compare and contrast the actionable genomic alterations found in cfDNA or CTC derived DNA that are not found in tumor tissue.

 III.

 To assess whether genetic alterations known to be associated with endocrine monotherapy resistance is seen in cfDNA and CTC derived DNA.

 IV.

 To examine shifts in the populations of epithelial like CTCs and stem cell like CTCs during the course of endocrine therapy with palbociclib.

 V.

 To assess CTC expression of ER, HER2, and other markers of endocrine resistance.

 VI.

 To explore the proteomics of ER-positive breast cancer and identify biomarkers associated with early progression and neutropenia.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of blood at baseline and on day 1 of each treatment cycle.

 Patients also undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and 2 months.

 Biopsy samples are analyzed for genetic profile via next generation sequencing and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing.

 Biopsy samples are also used for the generation of xenograft mice model.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 years.

 Genetic Analysis in Blood and Tumor Samples From Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive and HER2 Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Palbociclib and Endocrine Therapy@highlight

This research trial studies genetic profiles in blood and tumor samples from patients with estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body who are receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.

 Examine the genetic changes associated with the cancer and comparing the genetic material from the cancer tissue with the genetic material found in the blood may help doctors to develop customized treatment for breast cancer.
