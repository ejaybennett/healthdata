(thirdQuint)Detection of Motor Seizures Using WBAN.

 The key of the project is digital signal processing of the movement data collected.

 The medical application sensors from Analog Devices will be worn around the wrist and legs of the participants.

 These sensors will continuously collect the motor movement data.

 The data will be send to the cloud from where it will be collected at a central hub for digital signal processing and detection.

 The data analysis results will be compared with the standard EEG results for Tonic Clonic seizures and results will be verified.

 Detection of Motor Seizures Using WBAN@highlight

This study aims to collect the motor movement data using sensors to detect Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures .

 Wearable sensors similar to smart watches will be used to detect seizures.

 The proposed system will consist of 3-4 wearable wireless sensor worn on the hands and legs.

 The data from these sensors will be send to the clod and collected to a central hub for analysis and detection of GTC Seizures.
