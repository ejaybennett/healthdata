(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Multiple EPO Injections in Children With Cerebral Palsy.

 Cerebral palsy is mostly caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy from preterm birth, involving inflammatory and apoptotic cellular response.

 Erythropoietin (EPO) has shown neuroprotective effects via activation of anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and anti-apoptotic pathways.

 The safety and feasibility of EPO in children were proven in previous clinical trials.

 In addition, the efficacy of EPO is actively being investigated and some reports have shown potential benefits in cerebral palsy.

 To confirm the safety and efficacy of multiple injections with expected effect, retrospective review on medical records was performed.
