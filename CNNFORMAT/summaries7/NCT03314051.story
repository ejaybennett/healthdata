(secondQuint)Long-term Treatment Outcome for Stage III NPC Patients and Risk Grouping by Plasma EBV DNA.

 The stage III NPC patients were the majority group of the patient population of NPC.

 But most clinical trials focused on the treatment of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition stage IVA/IVB treatment for high risk of recurrence or metastasis.

 No previous study reported the treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients.

 The investigators tried to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients and do risk grouping by plasma EBV DNA assay for future therapy improvement.
