(fifthQuint)Intraoperative Detection of Residual Cancer in Breast Cancer.

 For breast cancer lumpectomies, the presence of residual cancer cells left in the tumor bed after initial resection in inferred by post-operative margin assessment of the resected tissue by a pathologist.

 Phase C enrollment will include 5 patients per surgeon, with 2-3 surgeons per site and up to 11 sites.

 The assessment for completing the training will be done in collaboration between Lumicell and each surgeon and will be documented.

 Subjects undergoing a lumpectomy procedure to treat primary breast cancer will be injected with a single dose of LUM015 4 2 hours prior to surgery at a dose of 1.

0 mg/kg.

 The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care used by the surgeon.

 Patients will receive at a minimum the standard of care practices for each site.

 Lumicell-guided shaved cavity margins will be removed only after the surgeon has attempted to remove the main specimen with grossly negative margins.

 After Lumicell-guided therapeutic shaves are removed, the surgeon will continue to perform the lumpectomy procedure according to his or her institution's standard of care practice.

 Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed.

 All patients will continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required.

 Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.

 Intraoperative Detection of Residual Cancer in Breast Cancer@highlight

This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-site study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 imaging agent in conjunction with the LUM imaging device), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer patients.

 During the study, study physicians and clinical staff will complete hands-on training in anticipation of the upcoming pivotal study.

 Site-specific or user-specific issues related to the use of the device will be identified and addressed.

 Additionally, the data collected in the study will be used to continue training the tumor detection algorithm of the device.

 In this study, patients will be injected with LUM015 prior to surgery.

 The study physicians will perform lumpectomy procedures according to his or her institution's standard of care practice.

 After the main specimen removal is completed, the study physician will use the LUM Imaging Device to image the tumor bed.

 Therapeutic shaves will be removed based on the recommendation of the LUM Imaging System.

 Patients will be followed until their first standard of care post-operative follow-up visit.
