 Effect of Mini Implants Supported Over Dentures Versus Conventional Implant After Bone Expansion@highlight

The better form of ridge will provide using wider implants that can have better abilities to with stand forces and to prevent alveolar bone loss as much as possible.

 Ridge expansion gained some popularity due to easiness compared to any other procedure that can gain bone.

 However, this treatment modality needs to be evaluated as compared to Mini Dental Implants (MDIs) over denture in thin mandibular ridge.

 In mandibular edentulous patients having thin ridge, does the mini implant supported over denture, compared to the conventional implant supported over denture after bone expansion affect bone height around implants?
