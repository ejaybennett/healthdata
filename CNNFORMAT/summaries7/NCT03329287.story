(secondQuint)Simplified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression.

 The investigators have developed a simplified but standardized set of cognitive behavioral treatment (including the therapist's manual and patient self-help manual) for the patients of generalized anxiety disorder and depression, known as Simplified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SCBT).

 SCBT is the main psychological intervention of this study.

 The aim of this study is to verify its efficacy and applicability using a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled and single-blind design, and to optimize the treatment program.

 The investigators hypothesize that SCBT is effective in patients with depression or anxiety, and the manual is easily-operated for the therapists.
