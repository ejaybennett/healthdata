(thirdQuint)Biomechanical Effects of Wearing a Sacroiliac Belt in Women.

 SacroIliac (SI) joint dysfunction (also called pelvic girdle pain) has been associated with impaired load transfer across the lumbopelvic region.

 This can result in lower back pain as well as poor biomechanical adaptation during walking.

 Sacroiliac (SI) belts have typically been prescribed in order to mitigate pain and improve load transfer in individuals with SI joint dysfunction.

 It has been speculated that SI belts have the ability to instantaneously increase joint stability, and as a result improve load transfer and muscle activation and recruitment.

 However, this speculation is primarily based on anecdotal evidence; there is little biomechanical research supporting the effects of wearing an SI belt.

 In order to gain an improved understanding of the biomechanical effects of wearing an SI belt, the investigators propose to conduct a study with the following key objectives: 1.

 Determine if there are differences with respect to neuromuscular, kinematic, or pressure patterns during walking and/or standing between healthy stable individuals and individuals with SI joint dysfunction 2.

 Determine if wearing an SI belt affects neuromuscular, kinematic, or pressure patterns during walking and/or standing in women with sacroiliac instability Variables measured will include: 1.

 Kinematics will be collected to quantify posture and joint angles 2.

 Kinetics will be collected to quantify ground reaction forces 3.

 Plantar pressure will be collected to quantify force distribution and center or pressure 4.

 Joint moments (Lumbar-pelvic and Hip) will be added as variables.

 The investigators will use inverse dynamics to calculate various joint moments during walking.

 Biomechanical Effects of Wearing a Sacroiliac Belt in Women@highlight

Women with pelvic girdle pain PGP) often get relief from using a sacroiliac belt.

 The study will explore if there are differences and in the changes of lower body movement in stability with the belt on and with the belt off.

 Women with PGP will be matched with women without to explore if there is a difference between these two groups.

 This will be looked at in standing and in walking.
