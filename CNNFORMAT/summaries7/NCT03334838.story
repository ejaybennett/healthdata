(secondQuint)Study to Assess the Food Effect on the Pharmacokinetics of Nifurtimox Tablets in Chronic Chagas' Patients - Dietary Habits Study.

 Primary objective is to evaluate the effect of various food compositions on the PK of nifurtimox after a single oral dose (120 mg) administered under 3 types of fed conditions (low fat, dairy products, and high calorie and high fat), as well as fasted conditions, to assess relative bioavailability.

It was chosen to allow a direct inter-study comparison of PK data obtained in previous studies.

 A secondary objective of the study is to assess the relative bioavailability of 2 different dose levels of nifurtimox, given as a single oral dose, in a second group of patients.

The second treatment group addresses a biopharmaceutical aspect for which no study data have been obtained to date.

 In order to assess the relationship between dose and exposure (linearity of PK), an analysis of the dose range of 120 mg to 240 mg was chosen to close the knowledge gap for this dose range.
