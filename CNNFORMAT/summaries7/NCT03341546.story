(fifthQuint)Estimating Patient Size From a Single Radiograph.

 A non-commercial computational model has been developed in-house to estimate the patient's anterior-posterior or lateral depth using the radiographic image and the known exposure factors with which it was undertaken.

 This model has been tested using single composition phantoms and found to be accurate.

 If it was found to be accurate for real clinical examinations, this would automate the measurement of patient size and give institutions the estimate of patient size required for local paediatric patient dose audit.

 In turn, this would provide the national data required to propose national reference values for paediatric x-ray examinations, which would give all institutions an important comparator for their performance.

 This would lead to optimisation in those sites most requiring it; nationally, paediatric x-ray imaging would improve in time.

 This pilot study is necessary to determine if the computational model is accurate enough to be relied upon.

 Accuracy will be determined by comparing the estimate made by the computational model for each patient with an actual measurement of the patient's anterior-posterior abdomen depth made at the time of the examination.

 Estimating Patient Size From a Single Radiograph@highlight

A computational model has been created to estimate the abdominal depth of a patient from a single x-ray image.

 The model has been tested using phantoms and found to be accurate; this study aims to test the accuracy of the model with patients and in a clinical setting.

 This will be achieved by enrolling patient's who have already been referred for an anterior-posterior abdomen x-ray examination to the trial, taking a physical measurement of their anterior-posterior abdominal depth and then comparing this measured value with a value as estimated using the computational model based on the patient's x-ray image.
