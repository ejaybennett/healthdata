 This is a Phase I, first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, vehicle and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study in subjects with single-level, symptomatic lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (>6 months) and unresponsive to conservative therapy for at least 3 months.

 The study will compare single intradiscal injections of high and low dose IDCT with two control groups (saline, Sodium Hyaluronate).

 7 study visits will be completed by all subjects; screening, day 1 (injection day), week 4, week 12, week 26, week 72 and week 104.

 The subject will be assessed for safety and efficacy utilizing VAS and ODI questionnaires alongside radiographic evaluations.
