(firstQuint)Embryonic Ploidy Status in the Oncofertility Population.

 The study involves oncofertility patients--individuals who are undergoing or have undergone therapy for a malignancy--who are interested in pursuing or preserving fertility.

 In particular, it investigates chromosomal abnormalities or aneuploidy in the embryos of those individuals as compared to the general infertility population.

 Embryonic aneuploidy is largely due to reproductive senescence.

 As such the investigators will discuss oncofertility prevalence and treatment as well as reproductive senescence and assessment of embryonic aneuploidy.

 The study will seek to determine if there are changes in embryonic aneuploidy rates in oncofertility patients that differ from simple age related risks.
