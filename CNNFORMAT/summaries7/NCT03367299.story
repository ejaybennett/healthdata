(firstQuint)Sequential Chemotherapy and Blinatumomab to Improve Minimal Residual Disease Response and Survival in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

 Eligible patients with CD19+ Ph- BCP ALL (Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia) will receive homogeneous supportive care, chemotherapy and blinatumomab immunotherapy, and will be homogeneously analyzed for response at prefixed time points from induction day 1.

 For risk-oriented therapy, patients in complete remission (CR) will be stratified by risk class according to the diagnostic characteristics and MRD (minimal residual disease) study results during early consolidation.
