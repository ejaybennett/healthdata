(thirdQuint)Theater in School Sex Education - a Randomized Controlled Study.

 The spread of chlamydia indicates that current preventive work with condoms is insufficient.

 Research shows that reasons behind increased chlamydia include youths taking more sexual risks, due to altered attitudes and sexual behaviors.

 Since only condoms protect against both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancy, the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) chlamydia prevention program is to increase condom use.

 Research suggests that school is the most important arena for sex education, reaching all youths early in life, when many values on sex and relationships are instilled.

 International studies on theater in sex education indicate effects like increased knowledge on the topic, and partially changed attitudes and behaviors among youths.

 Furthermore, several studies show that youths feel theater is a good method for sex education and a supplement to standard education.
