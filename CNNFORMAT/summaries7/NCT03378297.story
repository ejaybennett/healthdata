(fifthQuint)IMPACT: A Non-randomized WOO Study of Novel Therapeutic Agents in Women Triaged to Primary Surgery for EOC.

 The women in Arm I will be included in the WOO trial, and will be treated with the study agent for 10-14 days prior to tumor reductive surgery, starting the day of laparoscopic surgery (+1 day).

 The treatment will be discontinued at the time of tumor reductive surgery.

 As the aims of the study include identification of changes in specific biomarkers and the cancer immunogram, it is a prerequisite of this study to also identify which biological changes are correlated with the laparoscopic surgery and postoperative procedures, and which are related to the study agents given.

 The first 16 women included in the WOO trial will therefore not receive any study agent, but will constitute the laparoscopic control group.

 Currently four agents are evaluated as of particular interest, as well as feasible to introduce, in the WOO study set up: metformin, acetylsalicylic acid, olaparib, and letrozol.

 The first agent listed in the protocol, metformin, will be given to 32 consequtive women, and drug related analyses will thereafter be performed.

 The next 32 women included in the study will receive the next agent on the list, acetylsalicylic acid, while analyses for the metformin group is ongoing, and after the acetylsalicylic acid study group has been included the next agent on the list is introduced.

 Should any of the included women be non-eligable to receive one study drug, they will either receive the next agent on the list of the four study drugs, if eligable, or be included as control.

 The women in Arm II who agree to participate in the study will not receive the study medication, but standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy until having decreased tumor load radiologically estimated and scheduled for optimal debulking procedure according to standard treatment of this group of patients.

 Samples from these women will be used as control in the translational part of the where we aim to identify potential molecular pathway(s) and cell type(s) that may be responsible for suboptimal debulking.

 During the cancer-directed surgical procedure in participants in both Arms additional tissue samples from matching sites, preferably from tissues removed as part of the operation, as well as blood and urine samples, are obtained for comparative analysis.

 By use of the collected samples we can evaluate the clinical and molecular impact of the study agents among those triaged to primary cytoreductive surgery.

 Promising therapeutic targets identified might later be explored separately in one of the consequtive treatment study groups.

 After the debulking surgery all women will follow the recommended standard of care, including chemotherapy and consolidating bevacisumab where indicated.

 IMPACT: A Non-randomized WOO Study of Novel Therapeutic Agents in Women Triaged to Primary Surgery for EOC@highlight

The study will be conducted in women with advanced (stage IIIa-IV) ovarian cancer of the histologic subtype high grade serous carcinoma (HGSOC) who are going through a diagnostic laparoscopy.

 They will recieve treatment with a study agent for 10-14 days before surgery.

 They will be allocated to different study groups according to the diagnostic evaluation performed as standard of care at the department.

 The study is non-randomized and unblinded.

 The primary investigational agents are: 1.

 Metformin tablets, 850 mg x 2 orally.

 2.

 Acetylsalicylic acid tablets, 160 mg x1 orally 3.

 Olaparib capsules, 300 mg x 2 orally 4.

 Letrozol tablets, 2.

5 mg x 1 orally
