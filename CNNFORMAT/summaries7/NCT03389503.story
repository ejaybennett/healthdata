(firstQuint)Comparison of Left and Right Transradial Approach for CAG and PCI.

 The three operators who are proficient in the left radial approach for coronary angiography and coronary intervention will be assigned to the right radial approach for 3 months (phase 1).

 After then, these three operators will switch approach site to the left radial for another 3 months (phase 2).

 Procedural success, time of the procedure, use of contrast agent, and fluoroscopic data will be compared between right radial approach (phase 1) group and left radial approach (phase 2).
