 The primary objective of the study is to assess whether an educational intervention aimed at increasing the caregiver's skills is able to reduce hospital admissions for any cause in patients with heart failure assisted at home.

 The General Practitioners who agree to participate are randomized in two groups: a) intervention group, whose patients are assisted in accordance with the procedures established by the project; b) control group, whose patients continue to be assisted in the usual modality.

 The intervention consists of an educational session for each caregiver aimed at improving his ability to recognize early symptoms and signs of heart failure.
