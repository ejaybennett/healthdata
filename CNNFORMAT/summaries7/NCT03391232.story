(thirdQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity of PolyPEPI1018 Vaccine in the Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (OBERTO).

 This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of PolyPEPI1018 as an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in approximately 10 subjects with mCRC.

 The study is composed of a 3-week Screening Period, the administration of a single dose vaccine (Day 1, Week 0), and a 12-week Follow-up Period.

 The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis.

 Screening should be performed in parallel with the subject's completion of the standard-of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the standard-of-care maintenance treatment.

 The single dose of PolyPEPI1018 will be administered after the subject initiates the maintenance regimen, and within 3 weeks after the eligibility CT scan was performed (should be performed at the completion of the first-line treatment).

 Subjects will be monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks after administration of PolyPEPI1018 (i.

e.

 Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12).

 Safety and Immunogenicity of PolyPEPI1018 Vaccine in the Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (OBERTO)@highlight

TREOS' Phase I clinical trial will investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single dose of PolyPEPI1018 CRC Vaccine as an add-on treatment to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

 This study will also explore the accuracy of prediction of pre-existing and newly induced CD8+ T cell responses in each patient using the PEPI Test and T lymphocyte infiltration detected in accessible biopsy sites.
