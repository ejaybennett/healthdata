(thirdQuint)The Therapy Effect of Azathioprine Initial or 14 Weeks After Combined With Infliximab on CD.

 Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents were widely used for many years and were proved to be most reliable drugs in Crohn`s disease (CD).

 About one-third of the patients would develop a secondary lost of response after initiating IFX therapy in one year follow-up.

 Immunosuppressor was thought to be a useful agent to reduce loss of response rate of infliximab.

But It remain unclear when should us add immunosuppressor during infliximab therapy.

This study aim to find the most valuable timepoint to initiate combination therapy to maximize therapeutic effect and minimize the adverse effect.
