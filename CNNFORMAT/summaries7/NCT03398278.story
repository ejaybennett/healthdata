(firstQuint)OTR Tablet 40 mg Fasted-state Bioequivalence Study.

 In this BE study, subjects with histories of chronic pain are chosen as the target population.

 Inclusion/exclusion criteria are strictly defined to reduce the potential variation of the PK data.

 Single dose design is chosen per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/WHO guideline on bioavailability (BA)/BE studies for modified-release products.

 As a general rule, cross-over design is applied in the study to decrease the inter-individual variations between the two cohorts.

 A washout period lasting for at least 7 half-lives of the investigational medicine is needed to eliminate the drug residual from the previous period7.

 The elimination half-life of oxycodone from OTR is 4.

5 hours, and a 6-day washout period is sufficient to achieve the aim.
