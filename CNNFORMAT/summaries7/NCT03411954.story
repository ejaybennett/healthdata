(secondQuint)Hippocampus Avoidance During Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for T4 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients.

 All patients received intensity modulated radiotherapy or Tomotherapy with or without chemotherapy.

 Before radiotherapy, the patients will receive brain MRI scanning and the brain MRI images will be fused with the head and neck CT scan images.

 The investigators develop the treatment plan with hippocampus avoidance.

 Cognitive function are evaluated before,during and after radiotherapy.

 Dose-volume Histograms are got to analyze the associated factors.
