(thirdQuint)Safety and Effectiveness of SOFIA/SOFIA PLUS for Direct Aspiration in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

 Several publications describing the use of aspiration as a first line treatment technique in AIS patients have shown superior technical results with similar clinical outcomes to those seen when using a traditional stent retriever.

 They have also shown decreased procedure time and cost.

 The aim of this study is to show similar results in terms of speed, Effectiveness and safety when SOFIA cent / SOFIA cent PLUS is the catheter used for first line aspiration thrombectomy.

 The SOFIA cent (Soft Torqueable Catheter Optimized For Intracranial Access) and SOFIA cent PLUS Catheter are single lumen, flexible catheters, designed with coil and braid reinforcement.

 The SOFIA cent / SOFIA cent PLUS catheters have a soft distal tip for easy navigation in tortuous vessels.

 The tip is steam shapable and the proximal shaft torquable to help steer around challenging bifurcations.

 The coil and braid construction provides enhanced kink resistance and 1:1 push / pull control.

 Once navigated to the site of the occlusion, the SOFIA cent / SOFIA cent PLUS catheters can be used in conjunction with an aspiration source, such as a pump or syringe, to facilitate aspiration thrombectomy of the occluded vessel.

 The SOFIA cent / SOFIA cent PLUS catheters have large lumens, developed to maximize aspiration power and capture of thrombus.

 SESAME is a multi-center, single arm, prospective, observational registry of the SOFIA cent / SOFIA cent PLUS Catheter in Europe.

 Consecutive patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset with an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (within the internal carotid artery and internal carotid terminus, middle cerebral -M1/M2 segments) will be treated using aspiration thrombectomy as first intention and site routine practice.

 Devices received CE-mark and will be used according to the 'Instructions For Use'.

 The follow-up visits will occur at 24 +/- 12 hours, at patient discharge, and 90+/-14 days post-procedure.

 Furthermore the study design is adaptive, prospectively stating interim analyses with specified stopping rules, which allow for the possibility of the study to terminate early based on either a determination of study success or of the futility to continue further enrollment.

 Safety and Effectiveness of SOFIA/SOFIA PLUS for Direct Aspiration in Acute Ischemic Stroke@highlight

Sesame is a European, multi-center, single arm, prospective, observational registry.

 Sesame aims to demonstrate that use of SOFIA cent /SOFIA cent PLUS catheter for direct aspiration as a first line treatment technique is fast, safe and effective in patients suffering an Acute Ischemic Stroke when assessed at 24 hours, discharge and 90 days after treatment.

 250 patients will be enrolled.

 All patients will be followed for 90 days or until death.
