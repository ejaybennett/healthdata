(thirdQuint)Protein Intake Associated With Physical Activity Related to Specific Outcomes.

 Surgical cancer patients will be categorized by their nutritional risk using a specific screening toll.

 During the hospital stay some measurements will be done.

 Such as resting energy expenditure (REE) before and after surgery; physical function evaluation; strength and quality of life.

 The proposed intervention is a post operative diet with a different amount of protein (diet with a standard amount of protein and a diet with high amount of protein) associated to an institutional protocol of physical activity.

 Protein Intake Associated With Physical Activity Related to Specific Outcomes@highlight

This is a Randomized Controlled Trial .

 The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis that whether a high protein diet combined with a physical activity protocol in surgical cancer patients admitted to the ICU in the post operative period is associated with better physical function at the hospital discharge as well as a better quality of life.
