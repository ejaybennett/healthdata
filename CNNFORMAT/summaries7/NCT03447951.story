(secondQuint)A Phase II Study of PTS100 in Primary HCC Patients.

 BCLC stage B patients who are ineligible for operational or current locoregional therapy.

 Enrolled patients are randomly assigned to either of the two total doses, 20% or 30% of total tumor volume.

 PTS100 is administrated via intratumoral injection.

 The required total dose is given in separate injection days, with maximal daily dose up to 10 mL at first IP administration, and is adjusted based on each patient's tolerability along the treatment.

 The treatment course lasts up to completion of the total dose, and the efficacy is evaluated 28 days afterwards.
