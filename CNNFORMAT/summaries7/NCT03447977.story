(fifthQuint)The Effect of Manual Treatment on Respiratory Parameters, Pain, Posture and Quality of Life in Chronic Neck Pain.

 Manual therapy and exercises are evidence-based methods for improving pain, muscle strength, range of motion, function and quality of life in individuals with neck pain.

 These physiotherapy approaches have been shown to improve respiratory functions in patients with neck pain and also in pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

 Studies show that to improve respiratory parameters in patients for chronic neck pain, mobilization of thoracic region and exercises for endurance of deep neck muscles are beneficial.

 Despite the proposal given in this study, there are few studies evaluating the relationship between respiratory functions and the strength of respiratory muscles in patients with neck pain in detail, and also the effectiveness of different physiotherapy-rehabilitation methods on respiratory functions on neck pain.

 In a single study on this subject, thoracic region manual therapy, stretching exercise program and both of these applications were applied for the subjects.

 At the end of the treatment, respiratory functions developed in all three groups; but both applications group have been shown to more effective than thoracic manual therapy group for increasing respiratory functions.

Exercises and manual therapy for cervical and/or thoracic region frequently used for chronic neck pain but there are no studies that compare manual therapy for different region on respiratory parameters.

 Therefore, our aim is to determine the effects of exercises with manual therapy methods for cervical and/or thoracic region in chronic neck pain patients on pain, posture, quality of life, as well as on respiratory parameters.

 The Effect of Manual Treatment on Respiratory Parameters, Pain, Posture and Quality of Life in Chronic Neck Pain@highlight

Neck pain which is common musculoskeletal system problem in all populations, negatively affects functional status and quality of life.

 Muscle spasms, postural problems in cervical and thoracic regions and impairment on respiratory parameters (respiratory functions and respiratory muscle strength) is seen with neck pain.

 Manual therapy and exercise are widely preferred in the treatment of neck pain for improve pain, posture, muscle strength, range of motion, functional status and quality of life.

 There are some studies showing that manual therapy improves respiratory parameters in pulmonary diseases but studies are lacking for neck pain.

 Our aim is to indicate that effects of manual therapy, manual therapy for different regions (cervical and/or thoracal region) and exercises for pain, posture, quality of life and also respiratory parameters in patients with chronic neck pain.
