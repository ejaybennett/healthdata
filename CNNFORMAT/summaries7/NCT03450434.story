 XC8 in the Treatment of Patients With Bronchial Asthma@highlight

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparative Phase II clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of XC8 vs Placebo in patients with partly controlled bronchial asthma receiving stable treatment with low doses of inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta2-agonists during 12-weeks treatment period.

 Study design was developed by Pharmenterprises LLS, Russia in cooperation with Eurrus Biotech GmbH, Austria and FGK Clinical Research GmbH, Germany.

 The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of XC8 on change in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (% of predicted value) at Week 12 as compared to baseline at Week 0 vs.

 Placebo in patients with partly controlled bronchial asthma (BA).
