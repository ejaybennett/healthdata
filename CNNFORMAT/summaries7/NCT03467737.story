(fifthQuint)Assessment of Starch Digestibility and Amylase Sufficiency in Children.

 The purpose of this research is to test the hypotheses that: 1.

) Moderately malnourished stunted children have low pancreatic -amylase activity; and 2.

) Modified starchy food preparations will have better (higher) digestibility than the commonly given foods for both moderately malnourished stunted and healthy non-stunted children.

 A noninvasive breath test was used to assess amylase insufficiency in moderately malnourished and stunted children in Mali, as well as in healthy children in Mali and the United States.

 Moderately malnourished and healthy children in Mali were fed sorghum porridges, which are commonly consumed in Mali.

 Porridges contained a 13C-labeled substrate (algal starch or octanoic acid) for assessment of amylase insufficiency and gastric emptying rate.

 In a follow-up study, healthy children in the United States were also assessed for amylase sufficiency.

 Assessment of Starch Digestibility and Amylase Sufficiency in Children@highlight

Research has demonstrated that there is a relationship between malnourishment and insufficient production of pancreatic enzymes, such as -amylase which digests starch into glucose.

 Starchy foods that can be easily digested into glucose are critical to the development child for energy and proper growth.

 This study investigated the use of a noninvasive breath test for the assessment of amylase sufficiency, digestibility of normal and modified sorghum porridges and gastric emptying rate of a sorghum porridge in Malian and U.
