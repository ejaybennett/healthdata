(thirdQuint)Effect of Kinesiotaping on Force Irradiation.

 Fourty healthy subjects with no history of neurological or recent musculoskeletal injury will participate the study.

 Healthy subjects are arranged in two groups of stimulation: kinesiotaping group (kinesiotaping and force irradiation) and control group (only force irradiation).

 The electromyographic response of the resting arm (non-dominant) will be assessed during the dominant arm movement for all subjects.

 Additionally, in kinesiotaping group, kinesiotaping will be applied 24 hours before the experiment.

 The electromyographic response of the resting arm will be assessed under three contraction type movement (isometric, eccentric and concentric contractions) The SEMG signals are analysed by using MATLAB(R), suitable signal proccessing techniques (linear envelope, Root Mean Square etc) are chosed.

 The statistical analysis are done by using SPSS(R), according to data distribution, "Independent Sample T Test" or "Mann-Whitney U Test" is utilized for comparing outcomes of control and KT groups.

 Effect of Kinesiotaping on Force Irradiation@highlight

The study is assessed the electromyographic activity response of non-dominant biceps brachii muscle during unilateral-dominant concentric, eccentric and isometric biceps brachii muscle contractions under kinesiotaping and non-taping conditions.

 The aim of the study is to determine the synergistic effect of kinesiotaping which is applied on non-dominant biceps brachii muscle on force irradiation.
