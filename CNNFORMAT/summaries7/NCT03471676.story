(thirdQuint)Study of the Correlation Between Muscle Oxygenation and Motor Function in Children With Neuromuscular Disease.

.

 Preliminary data underline the fact that muscular deoxygenation during training happens earlier in adult patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders in comparison to controls, as it was demonstrated in Becker muscular dystrophy patients and fascioscapulo humeral muscular dystrophy.

 Moreover, the deoxygenation kinetics was positively correlated to the functional status and the muscular deficiency severity.

 However, no pediatric study has been conducted on this topic up to date.

 The aim of the study is to determine if a correlation exists in children suffering from neuromuscular diseases: - between muscular oxygenation and the percentage of the 6 minutes walking test performed in the routine medical care - between muscular oxygenation and the total and D1 motor function measure value.

Preliminary data underline the fact that muscular deoxygenation during training happens earlier in adult patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders in comparison to controls.

 Up to date, pediatric data are lacking.

 The study aims at demonstrating if a correlation exists between the motor deficiency and the muscular deoxygenation in children suffering from neuromuscular disorders.
