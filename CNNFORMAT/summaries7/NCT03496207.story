(fifthQuint)A Study of Sotatercept for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).

 This is a Phase 2, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of sotatercept plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC in participants with PAH of WHO Group 1, functional class II-III.

 Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sotatercept 0.

3 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) every 21 days, sotatercept 0.

7 mg/kg SC every 21 days, or placebo every 21 days for a period of 24 weeks in the double-blind Treatment Period of the study while on standard of care therapy.

 Evaluations will include changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), six-minute-walk distance (6MWD), quality of life questionnaires, echocardiographic parameters, and safety.

 Participants who have not discontinued early from the Treatment Period and have had their post-Treatment Period PVR assessment will be eligible (per investigator assessment) to continue into the 18-month Extension Period in which sotatercept-treated participants will receive their latest dose level of sotatercept SC every 21 days and placebo-treated participants will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive sotatercept 0.

3 mg/kg SC every 21 days or sotatercept 0.

7 mg/kg SC every 21 days while on standard of care therapy.
