(thirdQuint)F18 DCFPyL PET/CT in Imaging Participants With Recurrent Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate fluorine F 18 DCFPyL (18F-DCFPyL) PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

 OUTLINE: Participants receive fluorine F 18 DCFPyL intravenously (IV).

 After 60-120 minutes, participants undergo whole body PET/CT.

 Immediately after the first scan, participants may undergo a second PET/CT without receiving fluorine F 18 DCFPyL.

 After completion of study, participants are followed up at 24-72 hours.

This study provides fluorine F 18 DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to participants with prostate cancer that has come back.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 DCFPyL PET/CT, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.
