(thirdQuint)Ultrasound Guided Quadratus Lumborum Block for Post Operative Analgesia After Hip Arthroplasty.

 Sensory innervation of the hip region involves branches of the lumbar plexus and sacral plexus.

 Effective post operative analgesia can be approached by blocking the lumbar plexus at the level of the quadratus lumborum muscle.

 Quadratus lumborum block has several approach methods (anterior, lateral, posterior, and intramuscular).

 Anterior quadratus lumborum block also known as transmuscular QL block or QL3, the local anaesthetic (30ml of bupivacaine 0.

375%) is injected between the psoas major muscle (PM) and the quadratus lumborum muscle (QL).

 Therefore, the anterior quadratus lumborum block may generate analgesia from T10 to L4 covering the sensory innervation of the hip region.

The study evaluates the effectiveness of anterior quadratus lumborum block for post operative analgesia after hip arthroplasty.

 Half of the participants will receive ultrasound guided anterior quadratus lumborum block using 30ml bupivacaine 0.

375%, while the other half will not receive the block ( control group).
