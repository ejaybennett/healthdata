(fifthQuint)Efficacy of Extremely Low Magnetic Field (ELF) in Fibromyalgic Patients.

 In the first part of the protocol the group true-sham received 6 twice a week sessions of true ELF therapy of 1 hour, following the antinflammatory, analgesic and biorhythm settings of the device "LIMFA Therapy(R)".

 The sham-true group patients received 6 twice a week sessions of sham therapy (no therapy).

 During the second part of the protocol, the true-sham group received the sham therapy twice a week for 3 weeks and the sham-true group received the actual true therapy twice a week for 3 weeks.

 For the assessment of pain, sleep quality and global quality of life, a set of questionnaires were administrated at specific stages of the protocol.

 Questionnaires were administrated every three weeks: before the first therapy, after the first course of therapy, after the washout period, after the second course of therapy, and 3 weeks after the end of treatment.

 Efficacy of Extremely Low Magnetic Field (ELF) in Fibromyalgic Patients@highlight

This is a randomized double-blind crossover study.

 The investigators applied ELF with a device named "LIMFA Therapy(R)" to 48 fibromyalgic patients, assigned in two groups (true-sham and sham-true).

 Fibromyalgia severity was assessed with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), quality of sleep with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and global quality of life with Short Form-12 of Physical and Mental Health Summary (SF-12) questionnaire.
