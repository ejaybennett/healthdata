(firstQuint)Silent Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Mitral Stenosis and Sinus Rhythm and Its Correlation Left Atrial Thrombus.

 Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) continues to be a serious health problem in the developing countries, where it causes most of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in young people, leading to about 250 000 deaths per year worldwide.

 Unlike other valvular lesions, which might be attributed to multiple etiologies, Mitral stenosis (MS) alone or in combination with other valvular lesions is almost exclusively attributed to RHD.

 Incidence of rheumatic MS parallels that of acute rheumatic fever.

 Approximately 25% of all the patients with rheumatic heart disease have pure MS and an additional 40% have combined MS and Mitral regurgitation (MR).

 Mitral stenosis is the most noteworthy valvular heart disease to cause atrial fibrillation(AF), The incidence of AF in mitral stenosis has been estimated at 4O%.

 Approximately 60% of patients with MS older than 50 years have AF due to increased left atrial (LA) pressure and left atrial enlargement.

 All people with AF are initially in the category called First detected AF.

 These patients may or may not have had previous undetected episodes.

 If a first detected episode stops on its own in less than 7 days and then another episode begins, later on, the category changes to Paroxysmal AF.

 Although patients in this category have episodes lasting up to 7 days, in most cases of paroxysmal AF the episodes will stop in less than 24 hours.

 If the episode lasts for more than 7 days, it is unlikely to stop on its own, and is then known as Persistent AF.

 Silent AF (SAF) is an asymptomatic form of AF incidentally diagnosed during routine examination or manifesting as an AF-related complication, such as ischemic stroke or tachycardiomyopathy.

12 The real incidence of SAF in general population is still unknown, and this can be considered a major healthcare problem since the SAF paroxysms have been correlated with the same increased risk of ischemic stroke as symptomatic episodes.

 The preferred methods for identifying SAF recurrences are single 12-lead ECG recordings at outpatient visits and 24 hours Holter ECG recordings.

 Atrial fibrillation is associated with the development of left atrial and LA appendageal thrombi, which are the main source of stroke and systemic embolism.

 80% of the patients of MS in whom systemic emboli develop are in AF.

 Also thrombus formation is seen in 33% of patients with rheumatic MS in AF.

 Various studies, involving a small group of patients (<150) with MS in sinus rhythm (SR) have reported LA thrombus formation in 2.

4-13.

5% of patients.

 Due to the serious implications of LA thrombus, it is mandatory to search the LA in every patient of MS for any evidence of thrombus especially if it is presenting with AF.

 Echocardiography is the best noninvasive method for detecting the LA thrombus.

 However there are well-recognized limitations in detecting LA thrombus by 2-D trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) especially those in the LA appendage.

 Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been shown to overcome this problem and has proved to be highly sensitive for detecting LA thrombi.

 Once a thrombus is detected in LA the treatment plan, strategies, surgical and interventional techniques are greatly altered.

 Anticoagulant therapy is indicated in patients who have MS and either paroxysmal or persistent AF.

 But In patients with sinus rhythm, anticoagulation is indicated when there has been prior embolism, or a thrombus is present in the left atrium (recommendation class I, ESC guidelines).

 There is, however, a strong consensus regarding the decision for oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with SAF, as most responders consider that identifying a single episode of the arrhythmia is sufficient to recommend oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with high thromboembolic risk.

 This is important because data collected by Holter electrocardiograms reinforce the assumption that even short episodes of SAF convey increased risk of stroke.

 Regarding all previous facts our study aims to detect prevalence of silent atrial fibrillation by 48 hours Holter monitoring in patients with Mitral stenosis and sinus rhythm and its correlation with the presence of left atrial thrombus in trans-esophageal echocardiography.
