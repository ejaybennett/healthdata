(fifthQuint)The EndRAD Trial: Eliminating Total Body Irradiation (TBI) for NGS-MRD Negative Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With ALL.

 A Phase II pilot trial will estimate survival after a non-TBI based conditioning regimen in patients diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are pre-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) next-generation-sequence (NGS) minimal residual disease (MRD) negative.

 The relationship of NGS-MRD status to survival in children, adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL undergoing any approach to allogeneic HCT will be explored in a larger cohort (treatment [phase II] and observational arms of the study).

 The primary objective is to estimate 2-year event free survival (EFS) in pre-HCT NGS-MRD negative patients with B-ALL undergoing a non-TBI based conditioning regimen through a multi-center prospective trial.

 The accrual period is 3 years.

 Patients that are NGS-MRD negative with B-ALL may be eligible for the Treatment Arm, which is myeloablative non-TBI conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa followed -matched related, unrelated, and umbilical cord blood transplants.

 Patients that are NGS-MRD positive will be followed on the observational arm for outcome.

 Study sampling will include NGS-MRD bone marrow (BM) aspirate and peripheral blood (PB) samples collected [same day when possible] pre-HCT (within 4 weeks), and post-HCT on days 42 14, 100 20, and 365 60; PB samples only will also be collected day 180 60 and 270 60; day +30, day +100, and 1-year post-HCT.

 NGS-MRD peripheral blood sample only at 6 months and 9 months post-HCT; (Blast specimen at time of diagnosis or relapse is required for NGS-MRD testing).

 The EndRAD Trial: Eliminating Total Body Irradiation (TBI) for NGS-MRD Negative Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With ALL@highlight

This study will evaluate the use of non- TBI (total body irradiation) conditioning for B-ALL patients with low risk of relapse as defined by absence of NGS-MRD (next generation sequencing minimal residual disease) before receiving a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

 Patients diagnosed with B-ALL who are candidates for HCT will be screened by NGS-MRD on a test of bone marrow done before the HCT.

 Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD negative will be eligible to receive a non-TBI conditioning regimen as part of the treatment cohort of the study.

 Subjects who are pre-HCT NGS-MRD positive will be treated as per treating center standard and will be followed in an observational cohort (HCT center standard of care).
