(fifthQuint)Community Development and Nutrition Education in Banke District, Nepal: Effect on Child Health and Growth.

 Child health and survival remain significant challenges in Nepal.

 Nepal is ranks 63rd highest in the world for "under 5 mortality" rate, with 54/1000 children dying before their 5th birthdays and 46/1000 infants dying before their first birthdays.

 Annually, more than 47,000 children die before reaching age 5 years.

 At these mortality levels, one in every 22 Nepalese children dies before reaching age 1, and one in every 19 does not survive to his or her fifth birthday.

 Nutritional status of children is extremely poor, with ~29% of children underweight and 41% stunted (respectively, weight and height <-2 SD from median) (UNICEF, 2011) (Ministry of Health and Population et al.

, 2012).

 Heifer Project International is a globally active NGO with more than 400 projects in over 30 countries.

 The organization uses the introduction of livestock and related training in the development of social capital as tools for poverty alleviation, citizen empowerment, and community development.

 Heifer International recognizes the links between poverty, child malnutrition, and disease.

 However, improving economic indicators is not always sufficient to improve child outcomes.

 Thus, the organization now wishes to conduct a systematic assessment to evaluate the effects of introducing a child health and nutrition component into their work, and to clarify the links (if any) between social capital training and child growth and health.

 In doing so, Heifer International expects to develop a model which could be adapted for use in other regions of the world.

 The interaction of Heifer community development activities, specific child and family characteristics, and child health and nutritional status will also be explored.

 Community Development and Nutrition Education in Banke District, Nepal: Effect on Child Health and Growth@highlight

Heifer Project International is a globally active NGO with more than 400 projects in over 30 countries.

 The organization uses the introduction of livestock and related training in the development of social capital as tools for poverty alleviation, citizen empowerment, and community development.

 In a pilot project conducted in 2009-2012, these activities were found to promote some improvement in child health and nutritional status.

 However, robust enhancement of these important indicators was not observed.

 Heifer now intends to investigate the efficacy of a nutrition and child health education program in amplifying these effects.
