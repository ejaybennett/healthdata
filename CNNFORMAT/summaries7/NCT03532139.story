(thirdQuint)Pilot Study of Rosuvastatin and Enoxaparin Thromboprophylaxis Following Ovarian Cancer Surgery (O-STAT Study).

 Data from clinical trials show that drugs called "statins", which is a family of drugs that includes rosuvastatin, can prevent blood clotting in both cancer and non-cancer participants.

 Rosuvastatin is currently approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of blood clotting in the arteries of individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease.

 With this trial, the investigators hope to determine if it is reasonable to conduct a study in the future that determines the efficacy of blood clot prevention (prophylaxis) using rosuvastatin in combination with enoxaparin following surgery for ovarian cancer.

 Surgery and cancer are both known to increase the risk of blood clots.

 This study is being conducted to determine if there are better ways to reduce this risk.

 This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining how rosuvastatin in combination with enoxaparin affect certain factors in the participant's blood, which have been identified as having a link to increased risk of blood clotting.

 Rosuvastatin is an anti-cholesterol medication that is FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) approved to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of arterial blood clots.

 There is evidence that rosuvastatin can lower the risk of venous blood clots in healthy individuals but the FDA has not approved rosuvastatin for prevention of blood clots following ovarian cancer surgery.

 The FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has approved enoxaparin for prevention of blood clots following abdominal or orthopedic surgery and in medical patients with restricted mobility during acute illness.

 In this research study, the investigators are looking at differences between the levels of certain small particles that are thought to cause blood clots (thrombosis) in participants who receive a combination of rosuvastatin and enoxaparin compared with enoxaparin alone (or standard of care therapy).

 A protein called tissue factor is commonly present on ovarian cancer cells and cancer cells are thought to release particles in the blood containing tissue factor.

 The levels of these particles circulating in the blood have been linked to an increased risk of blood clots in people with cancer.

 Pilot Study of Rosuvastatin and Enoxaparin Thromboprophylaxis Following Ovarian Cancer Surgery (O-STAT Study)@highlight

This research study is studying a combination of two drug interventions called rosuvastatin and enoxaparin as a possible preventative measure against developing venous blood clots (such deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

 The drugs involved in this study are: - Rosuvastatin, also known as Crestor - Enoxaparin
