(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Routinely Measured Patient-reported Outcomes in Hemodialysis Care.

 The overall aim of this study is to explore the usefulness of integrating PROMs assessment, implemented through an e-health application, in the clinical management of hemodialysis patients.

 The specific objectives are as follows: Primary objective: to determine the effects of routine measurement and reporting to care providers of PROMs specifically a chronic kidney disease-specific PROM and/or a generic PROM, on patient-reported experience, particularly patient-clinician communication, for patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis.

 Secondary objectives: - To determine if there is a difference in patient-reported experience and management induced by a condition-specific versus a generic PROM; - To determine the effects of routinely measuring and reporting the PROMs on the clinical management of symptoms; - To determine the effects of routinely measuring and reporting the PROMs on health outcomes and healthcare utilization; - To determine the cost-effectiveness of routinely measuring the PROMs for patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis; - To explore the perspectives and experience of patients and clinicians with routine measurement and reporting of PROMs in clinical practice.

 Study Design: The investigators propose the use of a cluster RCT design to avoid any potential contamination between the study groups.

 This study is a pragmatic RCT that will involve the random allocation of clusters (i.

e.

, dialysis units) into four groups: - Group 1: Completes disease-specific PROM - Group 2: Completes generic PROM - Group 3: Completes both PROMs - Group 4: Usual care; does not complete any of the PROMs (control) Treatment aids for symptoms assessed by the PROMs will be made available for all clinicians in all study groups.

 Details about intervention and treatment aids are provided below.

 Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the routine measurement and reporting of PROMs will lead to improvement in communication between CKD patients and clinicians in dialysis units in Canada compared to usual care.

 The investigators also hypothesized that this will lead to better symptom and disease management, and improvement in mental health and quality of life.

 Furthermore, the investigators anticipate that this intervention will be cost-effective and will be acceptable and feasible in the dialysis units' environment.

 Setting and Population: All available dialysis units from Alberta (Northern and Southern Alberta Renal Programs - NARP/SARP) and selected units in Ontario (Ontario Renal Network - ORN) will be invited to participate in this study.

 The unit of randomization will be the dialysis units within NARP/SARP/ORN, not dialysis programs or individual patients.

 Randomization will be done within each renal program (NARP/SARP/ORN) to ensure that units from all programs are represented in all study groups.

 Dialysis Unit Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion criteria: - Hemodialysis unit providing chronic in-center hemodialysis; - Hemodialysis care providers willing to review an individual patient's routinely collected PROMs as part of patient assessment.

 Exclusion criteria: - Hemodialysis unit unable or unwilling to administer the PROMs to in-centre hemodialysis patients as part of clinical workflow to all possible patients; - Hemodialysis unit already implementing PROMs measurements, and unable to withhold it during the trial period.

 Inclusion/exclusion criteria for individual patients: All patients undergoing hemodialysis who are 18 years or older at the start of the study, and are willing and able to complete the PROMs as part of the trial will be eligible to participate in this study.

 Interventions: Since blinding is not feasible in this trial, it will be conducted as an open trial.

 Consequently, research staff, clinicians, and all patients will be aware of group allocation; cluster randomization is intended to minimize potential biases associated with an open trial design.

 Eligible dialysis units will be randomly allocated to one of 4 study groups: 1.

 The disease-specific PROM group: The disease-specific PROM will be administered every 2 months to all patients able to complete the instrument for a period of 12 months.

 The PROMs results will be reported back to the patient, and patients will be prompted to follow-up with their care providers if they provide a positive response to any of the symptoms assessed by the PROM.

 The PROMs results will also be printed in a report form and added to the patient's medical chart for review by clinicians.

 The report will display each patient's most recent results in comparison with their previous results, and in comparison with the general dialysis population.

 The PROMs report will be accompanied by treatment aids for all symptoms.

 The proposed disease-specific PROM is the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale modified for renal patients (mESASr).

 2.

 The generic PROM group: The generic PROM will be administered every 2 months to all patients able to complete the instrument for a period of 12 months.

 The PROMs results will be reported back to the patient, and patients will be prompted to follow-up with their care providers if they provide a positive response to any of the symptoms assessed by the PROM.

 The PROMs results will also be printed in a report form and added to the patient's medical chart for review by clinicians.

 The report will display each patient's most recent results in comparison with their previous results, and in comparison with the general dialysis population.

 The PROMs report will be accompanied by treatment aids for all symptoms.

 The proposed generic PROM is the EQ-5D-5L.

 3.

 The disease-specific and generic PROM group: The disease-specific and generic PROMs will be administered every 2 months to all patients able to complete the instrument for a period of 12 months.

 The PROMs results will be reported back to the patient, and patients will be prompted to follow-up with their care providers if they provide a positive response to any of the symptoms assessed by the PROM.

 The PROMs results will also be printed in a report form and added to the patient's medical chart for review by clinicians.

 The report will display each patient's most recent results in comparison with their previous results, and in comparison with the general dialysis population.

 The PROMs report will be accompanied by treatment aids for all symptoms.

 4.

 The control or 'usual care' group: Patient in this group will follow usual care as provided in the dialysis unit and will not complete any PROM; however, all the treatment aids will be made available for clinicians in this study group during the trial period.

 Treatment aids: Treatment aids are clinical protocols developed by expert clinicians for the management of certain symptoms and disorders.

 Treatment aids specific to symptoms assessed by the disease-specific PROM (e.

g.

, itchiness, restless leg syndrome) and the generic PROM (e.

g.

, pain, anxiety/depression) will be developed and made available for all clinicians at all study sites.

 These treatment aids are intended to support clinicians in the management of symptoms identified by these PROMs.

 Treatment aids have been developed in the NARP, and are currently being piloted in an ORN PROMs pilot.

 For each symptom/problem area, a patient information sheet will also be developed and provided to patients, to better understand the reason why the symptom/problem may have developed, treatment options that might be considered, as well as self-care activities they can undertake to alleviate the symptom or problem.

 Study Period: The study will be implemented over 36 months.

 The first 6 months will involve the administrative approvals, completing ethics requirements, training of clinicians on the use of PROMs; the following 18 months will involve trial implementation including assessments and interventions.

 The last 12 months will involve compiling the data from all study sites, data analysis and reporting of results.

 REAIM Evaluation: The investigators will use the REAIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework to comprehensively evaluate the different components of the implementation of the EMPATHY trial.

 This will be done by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods.

 The main results (E-effectiveness) will be based on the traditional quantitative analysis of the cluster randomized trial for the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes.

 Elements of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation will be assessed through qualitative methods, including reviewing documents, charts, meeting minutes, and semi-structured individual interviews with samples of patients and clinicians who will be involved in the trial at different sites.

 These interviews will be conducted at baseline, 6-months and at the completion of the trial.

 Evaluation of Routinely Measured Patient-reported Outcomes in Hemodialysis Care@highlight

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are reports coming directly from patients about how they function or feel in relation to a health condition and its therapy, without interpretation of the patient's responses by a clinician or anyone else.

 PROMs capture patients' experiences of symptoms and impact of disease on functioning and can support clinicians to monitor disease progression and facilitate patient-centered care.

 The EMPATHY trial will determine the effects of routinely measuring PROMs on the experiences of patients undergoing hemodialysis in Alberta and Ontario.

 In this study, two kinds of PROMs will be used: a disease-specific PROM and a generic PROM.

 The disease-specific PROM focuses on health symptoms related to chronic kidney disease and the generic PROM focuses on general health.

 In the trial, patients will be invited to complete the PROMs, and results of the measures will be linked to treatment aids for clinicians, providing specific information on how symptoms can best be managed.

 These care pathways will also be available to patients not receiving PROMs.

 The main outcome of this study will be patient-clinician communication, which will be assessed using a questionnaire called the "Communication Assessment Tool".

 In addition to assessing the effect of using these questionnaires on patient-provider communication, this study will allow us to explore whether their use affects patient management and symptoms, use of healthcare services, and the overall cost of implementing these questionnaires in clinical practice.

 Each dialysis unit (including all patients) will be randomized to one of four study groups: 1) Patients will complete the disease-specific PROM; 2) Patients will complete the generic PROM; 3) Patients will complete both the disease-specific and generic PROM; 4) Patients will receive usual care.

 Clinicians (in dialysis units randomized to PROMs, groups 1-3) will receive the results of the questionnaires completed by the patients.

 This is intended to trigger the clinician to ask the patient about certain symptoms if any exist.

 All clinicians in all study groups will have access to the clinical "treatment aids", which are tools that help identify and manage certain symptoms that patients might have.

 For example, people with severe itching will be cared for based on a step-wise treatment algorithm.

 Patients will also receive a report of their questionnaire(s) results, with an explanation of what it means.
