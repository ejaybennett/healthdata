(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of the HF-ACP Website Study.

 Advance care planning is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health to understand and share their personal values, life goals and preferences in order to prepare for future decisions regarding medical care.

 Public awareness campaigns to promote ACP have been taking place for about 10 years without significant improvements in ACP completion rates.

 Content intended for use by the general public may be too vague for those living with a chronic illness.

 Framing ACP within the context of a specific disease may provide the impetus for a person to engage in ACP.

 The investigators believe the HF-ACP website will improve patient understanding of the life-limiting nature of HF, the ACP process and the need to plan ahead to help ensure the care they receive matches their treatment preferences.

 Effectiveness of the HF-ACP Website Study@highlight

This study evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive website on advance care planning for patients living with heart failure (HF-ACP website).

 The investigators will randomize patients to either the HF-ACP website or usual care to determine if the participants who use the HF-ACP website have higher advance care planning completion rates than participants assigned to usual care.
