(thirdQuint)Acupuncture on Anxiety and Inflammatory Events Following Surgery of Mandibular Third Molars.

 Studies using acupuncture have shown promising results in the control of pain, edema, trismus and anxiety control.

 The use of this technique is interesting considering the negative effects of excessive use of medicines and the side effects of medications which are the most common treatment used for the control of these complications.

 However, there are no reports in the literature that evaluated the effects of acupuncture on the control of these variables following mandibular third molar extraction, using the placebo-needle design and blinding the patients, operators, and evaluators.

 Therefore, the aim of this split-mouth randomized triple-blind clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture for the control of pain, edema, trismus and preoperative anxiety in the extraction of third molars.
