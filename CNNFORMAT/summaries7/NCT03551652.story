(fifthQuint)Comparison of Duration of Neuromuscular Block in Geriatric Patients Compared to Young Patients.

.

 Scientific justification Elderly patients, especially geriatric patients, represent an increasing percentage of patients receiving anesthesia.

1 Thus, among the population over 75 years old, the annual rate of anesthesia represents 16.

8 / 100 inhabitants.

6 / 100 in men.

 2 This is a growing population, but also the most fragile population with a mortality amounting to 44.

 After 85 years, one out of every two anesthetized patients is ASA 3 or higher.

 2 The first cause of mortality linked to anesthesia today remains respiratory complications, particularly those of infectious origin.

5 The care of this population presents a major public health challenge.

 Studies on the use of curare and especially rocuronium are relatively old and did not study a geriatric population, so in the group aged the average age was 70 years.

7 Several studies show an increase in the duration of neuromuscular blockade in patients over the age of 70, regardless of any renal failure, with extremes of persistent curarization more than 2 h after a single dose.

6,7,10, 11 However, no study to date has investigated the duration of deep-tissue neuromuscular blocking (train of four (TOF) 80 years old).

 Evaluation criteria Primary judgment criterion: Total curarization time (DCT, defined as the sum of the installation time + deep curarization time + recovery time The installation time (Dinstall) is defined as the time between the injection of rocuronium and the disappearance of the responses to the train of four (TOF = 0).

 The deep block duration (Dprof) is defined as the time between the disappearance of the responses to the train of four (TOF = 0) and the reappearance of the first response to a train of four (TOF = 1).

 The recovery time (Drecup) will be evaluated for both a T4 / T1 recovery 0.

 Research Methodology Patients will be anesthetized, as in clinical routine, with propofol in target controlled infusion anesthesia (TCI) according to the Schnider model at the effect site.

 Analgesia will be provided either by remifentanil or sufentanil.

 Neuromuscular block will be monitored using TOF-WatchSX (Organon), with accelerometry measurement at the adductor pollicis.

 The TOF-WatchSX will be calibrated in cal 2 mode, as defined by the manufacturer.

 (12) Neuromuscular blockade will be induced by a single dose of rocuronium 0.

6 mg / kg of actual weight.

 The intensity of the neuromuscular block will be measured by a train of four every 15 s from the curare injection to TOF = 0 (Dinstall): then every minute until TOF = 1 (Dprof); then every minute until T4/T1 0.

 Patient selection: inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, recruitment modality Criteria for inclusion: - Patient aged 18 to 50 or 80 years - Body mass index (BMI) between 18.

5 and 35 - Intervention requiring general anesthesia with intubation Criteria of non-inclusion: - Rocuronium allergy - Need for rapid sequence induction - Clinically apparent hepatocellular insufficiency - Renal insufficiency requiring dialysis - ASA> 2 in the group of 18 to 50 years Materials and techniques used Monitoring of the TOF-WatchSX monitor curarization at the level of the adductor pollicis.

 The electrodes are placed at the ulnar edge of the arm 2 cm apart.

12 Calibration in cal 2 mode of TOF-WatchSX Measurement of the neuromuscular block intensity every 15s from the neuromuscular blocking facility to TOF = 0, then measured every minute of the neuromuscular block up to TOF = 1(Dprof) and finally measured every minute until decurarisation spontaneous T4 / T1 0.

 Normothermia is maintained (temperature> 36 C) by the use of a forced air system (Bair Hugger) with temperature monitoring by oesophageal probe.

 Statistics Number of patients: To estimate the number of patients to be included in each group, we postulate that the DCT of patients 80 and over is, on average, at least 30% greater than the CSD of patients under 50 years of age.

 The mean DCT of the under-50 group is around 60 minutes and a standard deviation of 11 minutes.

 By setting the alpha risk at 5% and the expected power 80%, it will be necessary to include 14 patients per group, or 28 in total.

 Statistical analysis : Descriptive analysis: calculation of%, means, standard deviations, quartiles and extreme values Principal analysis: the mean DCT will be compared by a matched series average comparison test, then by a linear regression model with adjustment for potential confounders, excluding matching factors.

 Secondary analyzes: The secondary endpoints will be compared by a MacNemar test and a Student's t-test on matched series and possibly by conditional logistic and linear regression models to allow an adjustment for potential confounding factors.

 Threshold of significance: 5% Software: SAS v9.

 Comparison of Duration of Neuromuscular Block in Geriatric Patients Compared to Young Patients.

@highlight

Elderly people, especially geriatric patients, account for a growing share of patients receiving anesthesia (1).

 In patients over 75 years of age the annual rate of anesthesia represents 16.

8 / 100 inhabitants for women and 19.

6 / 100 for men (2).

 It is a growing population, but also the most fragile population with a mortality amounting to 44.

4 / 10000 anesthesia (3,4).

 After 85 years, one out of every two patients is ASA 3 or older (5).

 The first cause of death related to anesthesia today remains respiratory complications, particularly infectious (6).

 This is a major public health issue right now.

 The studies on the use of curare and particularly rocuronium are old and did not study a population of elderly people (with an average age of 70 years) (7).

 Several studies show an increase in the duration of neuromuscular blockade in patients older than 70 years irrespective of any renal failure (6,10,11), with sometimes persistent curarizations more than 2h after a single dose (6,7).

 But no study to date has studied the duration of deep-intensity neuromuscular block (TOF)
