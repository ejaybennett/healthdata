(firstQuint)A Comparison of Capnography Sampling Lines.

 The eight (8) Capnography CO2 Sampling Filterlines (CCSF) have different designs for obtaining a gas sample for measurement and delivering supplemental oxygen (O2).

 In this study awake, healthy volunteers will evaluate the 8 CCSF (Capnography CO2 Sampling Filterline) to determine their variability in detecting exhaled CO2 during scripted activities when altering the delivery of supplemental O2.
