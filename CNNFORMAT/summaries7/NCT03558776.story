(thirdQuint)Influence of the Background Diet on Metabolism of Land-based n-3 PUFA.

 The KoALA study focuses on the impact of variations in the background diet as a confounding factor.

 The intake of linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 n-6) has been suggested to diminish the metabolism of -linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3).

 In this context, the proposed study will be conducted to evaluate the influence of the background diet, in particular the impact of the simultaneous intake of LA on the conversion of ALA into their long-chain (LC) metabolites, the incorporation of n-3 LC-PUFA in human tissues and their metabolism into eicosanoids and docosanoids.

 Further, the influence of a regular intake of milk fat, in particular from free-grazing ruminants, on n-3 PUFA metabolism will be investigated, because short- and middle-chain fatty acids as well as the branched-chain fatty acids in milk fat may influence the conversion of ALA into n-3 LC-PUFA (hypothesis).

 Thus, validated nutrition concepts for increasing n-3 LC-PUFA status from plant sources will be developed to ensure an adequate intake of n-3 PUFA according to the guidelines of nutritional societies and as a contribution to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

 Influence of the Background Diet on Metabolism of Land-based n-3 PUFA@highlight

KoALA study - assessment of the influence of the background diet on the metabolism and the bioavailability of plant n-3 PUFA from linseed oil.

 In particular, the study design focusses on the impact of variations in the background diet as confounding factor (e.

g.

 variations in concurrently intake of linoleic acid (n-6)).

 Further, the influence of a regular intake of milk fat, in particular from free-grazing ruminants, on n-3 PUFA metabolism will be investigated.
