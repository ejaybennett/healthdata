(fifthQuint)The Effects of MBSR on Patients With TBI and Chronic Insomnia.

 Randomized, controlled trial with 1:1 randomization (n=50).

 The control group will receive the usual care for TBI through the clinical program with standard providers based on usual patient evaluation and needs.

 The intervention group will receive MBSR in addition to the usual care through the TBI program.

 The usual care pathway will include physician visits, rehabilitation therapies (PT/OT/ST/et al), and other providers as needed based on recommendations by his or her providers.

 Some variability will exist, but withholding standard of care would be unethical and standardizing care would be impossible.

 However, providers will be asked that medications, et al that could affect sleep remain unchanged during the trial period (maximum 12 weeks), which is reasonable given that patients have a chronic injury and no emergent/acute needs based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 Subjects in a control group will be offered complimentary MBSR after 6 month follow up visit is completed.

To evaluate the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as an adjunct to usual clinical care for treatment of stress and chronic insomnia for patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (MTBI).

 MBSR is a standardized protocol of meditation and yoga that has been studied extensively in other populations, however the effects of MBSR have not yet been well studied in the proposed population of service members with a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) who are experiencing insomnia.
