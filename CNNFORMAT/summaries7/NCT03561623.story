(secondQuint)Spinal Cord Gray Matter Imaging in Post Polio Syndrome.

 Post-Polio syndrome (PPS) is characterised by new muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue several years to decades after the acute polio infection.

 Pathomechanisms are not yet fully understood.

 This is a longitudinal, observational study.

 The aims are (a) to detect spinal cord gray (and possibly) white matter atrophy in patients with Post Polio Syndrome in comparison to healthy age and sex matched control subjects both cross-sectionally and longitudinally and (b) to correlate spinal cord gray and white matter atrophy to metrics of clinical disability.

 Investigators will assess 20 patients with Post-Polio syndrome and 20 control subjects at baseline and 48 weeks by MRI and clinically including quantitative muscle strength assessments.
