(fifthQuint)Immunological Measurement of Aspartate/Alanine Aminotransferase.

 Enzymatic analysis of aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) does not exactly represent the progression of liver fibrosis.

 Immunoassay for the AST (cytoplasmic [c] AST/mitochondrial [m] AST) and ALT (ALT1/ALT2) have been suggested as one of the alternatives for the enzy-matic analysis.

 We evaluated the efficacy of immunoassay in predicting liver fibrosis and in-flammation.

 A total of 219 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who underwent hepatic ve-nous pressure gradient (HVPG) and liver biopsy before antiviral therapy were recruited.

 Serum samples were prepared from blood during HVPG.

 The liver function test including enzymatic AST/ALT and immunological cAST, mAST, ALT1 and ALT2 were checked with sandwich ELI-SA immunoassay with fluorescence labeled monoclonal antibodies, and were compared with the METAVIR stage of live fibrosis and the Knodell grade of inflammation.

Previous reports have suggested that ALT-immunoglobulin complex was increased according to the severity of the liver disease, and high concentration of mAST and this might indicate a severely damaged liver.

 Immunoassay might be useful as a screening method in the differ-ential diagnosis of liver fibrosis according to patients.

 In this study, the efficacy of immunoas-say in the prediction of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was evaluated.
