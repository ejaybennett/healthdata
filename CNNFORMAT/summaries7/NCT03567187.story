(thirdQuint)Cryoneurolysis for Improvements in Pain, ADL and QOL in Patients With Ankle Osteoarthritis.

 The aim of this study is to assess clinically significant long-term symptomatic relief with cryoneurolysis in people with unilateral ankle osteoarthritis (OA).

 The investigators will treat the Superficial Fibular Nerve (SFN), Sural Nerve (SN) and Saphenous Nerve with cryoneurolysis using the iovera device.

 The primary study endpoint, clinically significant improvement in pain 12 weeks after treatment, will be assessed using the FAOS pain subscale.

 The secondary outcomes will be improvement in quality of life (FAOS-QoL), activities of daily living (FAOS-ADL) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain.

 The tertiary outcome will be improvement in physical performance measures (40m fast-paced walking test, standing balance test).

This will be an open-label trial to describe the effects of cryoneurolysis with iovera on symptom relief in patients with painful Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2-4 ankle osteoarthritis (OA).

 The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscales will be used to assess outcomes at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment.
