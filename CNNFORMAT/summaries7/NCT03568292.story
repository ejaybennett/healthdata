(secondQuint)Virtual Reality in Reducing Pain and Anxiety in Cancer Participants Undergoing Painful Procedures.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the feasibility of VR in patients undergoing procedural intervention.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate differences between the two arms in terms of pain and anxiety.

 II.

 To document any adverse events that could possibly be attributed to the VR intervention.

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Explore the use of biomarkers as a tool to reflect the impact of intervention.

 OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Participants undergo VR intervention peri-procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar puncture) lasting until completion of the procedure.

 ARM II: Participants receive standard of care during procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar puncture).

 Virtual Reality in Reducing Pain and Anxiety in Cancer Participants Undergoing Painful Procedures@highlight

This trial studies how well virtual reality (VR) works in reducing pain and anxiety in cancer participants undergoing bone marrow biopsy or lumbar puncture.

 Virtual reality may impact pain and anxiety during and after the procedure.
