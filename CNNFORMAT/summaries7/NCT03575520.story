(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Pegteograstim in Korean Breast Cancer Patients.

 Pegteograstim is a novel monoPEGylated recombinant human G-CSF.

 In this prospective study, the incidence of febrile neutropenia during four cycles of dose dense (DD) doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) with pegtoegrastim support is being investigated.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of febrile neutropenia during four cycles of DD AC with pegteograstim support (8 weeks).

 Patients received four cycles of DD-AC (60 mg/m doxorubicin and 600 mg/m cyclophosphamide administered intravenously on day 1 every two weeks).

 A fixed dose of 6.

0 mg pegteograstim was administered subcutaneously on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle (between 22 and 26 hours after the completion of chemotherapy).

 Clinical, hematological, and biochemical assessments were done before the start of each cycle.

 Adverse events (AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTCAE version 4.

03).
