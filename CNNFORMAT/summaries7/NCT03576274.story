(fifthQuint)Effect of Exercise on Cancer-Related Fatigue.

 With the advancement of cancer diagnosis and treatment, localized cancer patients have nearly 100% 5-year survival rate.

 Approximately 40% of these cancer survivors experienced severe fatigue up to 2 years post-treatment, which impact the quality of life of these individuals.

 To date, there are no US FDA approved medications to treat cancer-related fatigue (CRF).

 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN; 2015) recommends five non-pharmacological interventions to manage CRF, physical activity is one of the most effective interventions for CRF.

 The American cancer society recommended 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (exercise performed at 60-80% of maximum heart rate) for cancer survivors with no physical limitation.

 The aerobic moderate-intensity exercise program significantly improved fatigue among cancer patients.

 Cancer survivors are less likely to exercise due to the limitation in access to an exercise facility and scheduling conflict.

 To overcome these barriers, a home-based exercise intervention was used.

 Studies suggested a significant effect of home-based exercised on fatigue severity.

 Most home-based exercise programs were challenged by the lack of motivation and low adherence rate to the exercise regimen.

 This proposed study will use the goal setting by using step count from the physical tracker, which will be easier to implement and require no additional equipment and space for exercise.

 The integrated physical activity tracking device and mobile phone application will be used.

 This integrated system will allow the incoming data from an activity tracking device (e.

g.

, physical activity, heart rate, sleep) to trigger the mobile Ecological Momentary Assessment (mEMA) application to launch an immediate feedback and momentary survey on the phone.

 This new feature is promising as it will 1) allow the continuous monitoring of physical activity and heart rates and adherence, 2) increase motivation by providing immediate feedback and 3) measure outcomes (fatigue, steps) in the participants' home environment.

 The feasibility of this system will be tested in cancer survivors.

 Moreover, to enhance the effectiveness of exercise on fatigue, this study will examine the feasibility and effectiveness of the combined home-based exercise and others non-pharmacological interventions such as auricular point acupressure (APA) and the mindfulness-based intervention (MBI).

 These two non-pharmacological interventions can significantly decrease cancer-related fatigue and improve physical function.

 The effectiveness of these combinations is unknown.

 The investigators hypothesize that the combination of interventions are feasible and have a greater effect on fatigue and physical function.

 In addition to fatigue, the preliminary studies reported that patients with chronic fatigue had a high level of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

 HSPs are known as stress proteins that maintain proper protein folding for cell growth and survival against stress.

 BDNF is a member of the neurotrophic family of proteins that plays a significant role in neuronal survival.

 Both BDNF and HSPs can be modulated by oxidative stress during physical and psychological stressful events (e.

g.

, inflammation, extreme exhaustion).

 During stressful events, HSP90's function related to protein folding is altered leading to cell death, and BDNF is activated to enhance neuroprotective mechanisms.

 BDNF has been proposed to influence change in behaviors like depression.

 In cancer, high HSP90 is believed to support a malignant transformation and is currently a new anti-cancer treatment target.

 High HSP90 levels are associated with advanced stage of cancer and poor treatment prognosis.

 Studies in prostate cancer have shown that the HSP-based chaperone mechanism is involved in prostate cancer progression.

 Both HSP90 and BDNF levels can be changed by interventions such as rigorous exercise.

 No studies have investigated the effect of home exercise and combination of exercise with other nonpharmacological interventions on HSP90 and BDNF level in CRF patients.

 Information about the relationship among HSP90, BDNF, and CRF is highly important, for it may also trigger a discussion on the potential of CRF as a predictor of cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes.

 The organizing framework for this study will be guided by the biopsychosocial model, which incorporates biological influences, social influences, and psycho-behavioral influences on CRF.

 Investigators' hypothesis is that CRF is influenced by social (e.

g.

, interpersonal relationships with caregivers), psycho-behavioral (e.

g.

, depressive symptom, anxiety, physical activity and sleep disturbance), and biological factors (HSP90 and BDNF levels).

 Eligible participants will be asked of interest to participate and to sign the informed consent.

 Participants will complete the questionnaire package.

 The physical activity tracker (Microsoft Band 2) and the mEMA application will be installed on the participants' smartphone with written instructions on how to use both devices.

 Participants will be asked to wear the Microsoft Band 2 on the non-dominant arm and respond to the mEMA daily for 6 weeks.

 Participants' peripheral blood will be drawn at week 1 and week 6 by a registered nurse or certified phlebotomist.

 Participants will then be randomly assigned to the control group and experimental groups (TEHE only, TEHE + APA, TEHE +MBI groups).

 Participants in the experimental groups will receive an instruction and text message to remind participants to increase physical activity and to achieve the daily step goals, while the participants in the control group will continue with participants' daily usual physical activity.

 By participating in the study, participants will spend 6 weeks, with 6 study visits.

 Participants will continue to receive routine care and current treatment even when the study ends or if the participation end prematurely.

 Effect of Exercise on Cancer-Related Fatigue@highlight

A 6 weeks technology enhanced home exercise (TEHE) program using mobile technologies that provide immediate feedback and send reminder messages to improve exercise motivation is developed.

 Investigators combine this TEHE program with techniques including auricular point pressure (APA) and brief mindfulness body scan (MBI).

 The APA and MBI may enhance the effect of exercise on fatigue; however, the combination of these methods has not be tested.

 This study will examine the feasibility of the TEHE program and combined programs, and ascertain the effect of TEHE program alone, the combined programs on fatigue and biological markers among cancer survivors.

 Conceptual Framework: The biopsychosocial model Main Research Variable(s): The independent variables are the 6-week program of TEHE alone, combined APA and TEHE and combined MBI and TEHE.

 Outcome variables are fatigue, physical activity, contributing factors of fatigue and biomarkers.

 Design: Repeated measures randomized controlled trial design.

 Setting: Participants will be recruited through the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University.

 Sample: Participants diagnosed with breast and prostate cancer who have completed cancer treatment, aged 21 years or older, experiencing fatigue in the past 7 days on average of 3/10, able to participate in a moderate-intensity exercise training program, can complete the 6 min walk test with a perceived exertion of 3 or below, and can communicate in English.

 Methods: Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the TEHE only or APA +TEHE or MBI+TEHE or control group.

 All exercise groups will be offered a six-week, 60 min group exercise training program.

 Steps will be monitored using the Microsoft Band 2.

 Reminders to exercise will be sent to the patient daily.

 In additional to the TEHE, the APA+TEHE group will receive an instruction on how to apply the pressure on the ear points.

 The MBI+TEHE group will perform 15 min mindfulness body scan daily.

 The control (usual care) group will report participant's fatigue level daily and attend weekly meetings with the researcher to discuss fatigue.

 At the end of week 6, participants will answer open-ended questions about participant's opinions on the programs.

 Fatigue will be assessed and blood will be drawn before and after the program.
