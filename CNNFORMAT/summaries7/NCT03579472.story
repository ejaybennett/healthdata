(fifthQuint)M7824 and Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Participants With Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of eribulin mesylate (eribulin) when in combination with the fixed dose of M7824 in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

 II.

 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 when in combination with eribulin in patients with metastatic TNBC.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine the best overall response (BOR) rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.

1.

 II.

 To determine the overall response rate (ORR).

 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic TNBC patients treated with M7824 in combination with eribulin.

 II.

 To assess immunologic/molecular responses to M7824 in combination with eribulin in patients with metastatic TNBC, by performing correlative studies on tissue samples to evaluate systemic and tumor biomarkers of response and resistance to M7824 and eribulin.

 OUTLINE: Participants receive anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 intravenously (IV) over 50-80 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29, and eribulin mesylate IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 29.

 Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 90 days.

 M7824 and Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Participants With Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer@highlight

This phase Ib trial studies best dose and side effects of eribulin mesylate when given together with anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824) in treating participants with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as M7824, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

 Giving eribulin mesylate and M7824 may work better at treating triple negative breast cancer.
