(fifthQuint)A Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With a Panel of Subunit Recombinant HIV Envelope Vaccines.

 In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines, the evidence suggested that administration of a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.

 Seventy healthy volunteers are randomized to one of four groups.

 Groups A and D receive one initial immunization with HIVAC-1e followed by two boosts with subunit gp120 and Env 2-3, respectively, at months 8 and 12.

 Group B receives two immunizations with HIVAC-1e at months 0 and 8 followed by a single boost with subunit gp120 at month 12.

 Group C receives three doses of subunit gp120 only at months 0, 8 and 12.

 (Per 10/01/92 amendment, boosts with VaxSyn (gp160) have been eliminated.

) Subjects are followed for 18 months.

 A Phase I, Multicenter, Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With a Panel of Subunit Recombinant HIV Envelope Vaccines@highlight

Primary: To determine in healthy volunteers whether priming with a vaccinia HIV-1 gp160 envelope gene recombinant vaccine (HIVAC-1e) followed by boosting with one of two subunit recombinant HIV-1 envelope vaccines (Env 2-3 and gp120) provides enhanced immunogenicity compared to vaccination with the gp120 subunit vaccine alone.

 (Per 10/01/92 amendment, boosts with VaxSyn (gp160) were eliminated.

) To evaluate the immunogenicity of one versus two priming doses of HIVAC-1e prior to a boost with gp120.

 To compare the relative immunogenicity of the three subunit vaccines when administered as boosters.

 Secondary: To examine the safety of administering the individual subunit vaccines in combination with HIVAC-1e and the safety of administering the gp120 subunit vaccine alone.

 In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines, the evidence suggested that administration of a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.
