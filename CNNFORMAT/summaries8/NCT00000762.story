(fifthQuint)A Placebo-Controlled, Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Envelope Proteins of HIV-1 gp160 and gp120 in Children >= 1 Month Old With Asymptomatic HIV Infection.

 The initiation of this immunotherapy trial will provide multiple benefits by assessing in asymptomatic HIV-infected children a therapy currently being tested in their adult counterparts, in the hope of forestalling the progression of HIV immunosuppression and clinical disease.

 Patients are randomized to receive one of three vaccines (9 patients/vaccine) or the adjuvant placebos (3 patients/vaccine).

 The vaccines will be studied at both low and high doses.

 When three of four patients at the low dose of a vaccine have received two immunizations without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, dose escalation to the higher dose of that vaccine is initiated in subsequent patient cohorts, provided all low dose arms are filled.

 A total of six immunizations are given, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks.

 Patients are followed for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

To determine the safety and immunogenicity of gp160 (MicroGeneSys), rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech), and rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) and their adjuvants in HIV-infected children 1 month to 18 years of age.
