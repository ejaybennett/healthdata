(thirdQuint)Kidney-Sparing Surgery Compared With Kidney Removal in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare time to recurrence and survival of patients with single, low stage, nonmetastatic, well localized, and well delineated renal cell cancer treated with partial vs radical resection.

 - Establish the side effects of kidney-sparing tumor resection in terms of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

 - Study the relationship between tumor size, histologic grade, histologic type, and the extent of local control following partial resection.

 - Determine which prognostic factors are important in selecting candidates for conservative surgery.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to undergo radical nephrectomy and limited lymphadenectomy (arm I) or conservative surgery (arm II).

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1300 patients will be accrued for this study over 8 years.

 Kidney-Sparing Surgery Compared With Kidney Removal in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Kidney-sparing surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for kidney cancer, and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

 It is unknown whether kidney-sparing surgery is more effective than kidney removal in treating kidney cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to completely remove the kidney with kidney-sparing surgery in treating patients with resectable kidney cancer.
