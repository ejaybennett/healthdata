(fifthQuint)T4N5 Liposome Lotion Compared With Placebo Lotion for Preventing Actinic Keratoses in Patients With Xeroderma Pigmentosum.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Compare the safety and efficacy of T4N5 liposome lotion vs.

 a placebo lotion in reducing the incidence of actinic keratoses and protecting against other ultraviolet skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

 OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study.

 Groups of 6 patients are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to Arms I and II, respectively.

 Arm I: Chemoprevention.

 Lotion composed of T4 endonuclease V protein encapsulated in liposomes and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, T4N5 Liposome Lotion, T4N5.

 Arm II: Control.

 Liposomes suspended in phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, Placebo, PLCB.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6-30 patients will be entered in this multicenter study.

 T4N5 Liposome Lotion Compared With Placebo Lotion for Preventing Actinic Keratoses in Patients With Xeroderma Pigmentosum@highlight

RATIONALE: Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum are more likely to develop skin lesions in sun-affected areas.

 These skin lesions, such as actinic keratoses, can develop into skin cancer.

 T4N5 liposome lotion may reduce actinic keratoses or other sun-induced skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

 PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare treatment using T4N5 liposome lotion with treatment using placebo in reducing actinic keratoses and other sun-induced skin damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.
