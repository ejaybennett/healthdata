(thirdQuint)Liver Resection and Floxuridine Plus Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the efficacy of hepatic resection followed by portal vein infusion of floxuridine plus systemic fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

 - Study the toxic effects of adjuvant chemotherapy following hepatic resection.

 - Evaluate mRNA expression of enzymes that may be important to the cytotoxicity of fluoropyrimidines in tumor cells, including thymidylate synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, and folylglutamyl synthetase, by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.

 OUTLINE: Following resection of the liver and all extrahepatic colorectal cancer, patients receive floxuridine via portal vein infusion from days 1-14.

 Systemic chemotherapy consists of leucovorin calcium on days 8-14 and fluorouracil on days 9-13.

 Courses repeat every 4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks.

 If biopsy-proven metastatic disease develops, treatment may be stopped at the investigator's discretion.

 Continuation of regional therapy should be considered for extrahepatic failure.

 No concurrent radiotherapy is permitted.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6 months for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 50 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of surgery followed by floxuridine plus systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
