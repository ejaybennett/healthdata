(fifthQuint)Interferon Alfa Plus Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Estimate the rate of major cytogenetic responses to sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interferon alfa in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.

 II.

 Estimate the dosing, schedule, and toxic effects of GM-CSF plus interferon alfa in these patients.

 OUTLINE: All patients are in hematologic remission on subcutaneous interferon alfa upon entering the study.

 Once a complete hematologic response is achieved and the interferon alfa dose has been stable for 14 days, patients receive subcutaneous sargramostim (GM-CSF) daily for 6 months.

 Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Interferon Alfa Plus Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia@highlight

RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

 Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of therapy.

 Combining sargramostim with interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim in treating patients who are receiving interferon alfa for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is in remission.
