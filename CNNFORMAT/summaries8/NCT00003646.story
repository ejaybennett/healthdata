(thirdQuint)Gene Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Demonstrate an objective clinical response (partial or complete) with a median duration of at least 4 months in 15% of patients with stage III or IV melanoma treated with Allovectin-7.

 Allovectin-7 is a direct gene transfer immunotherapeutic agent.

 II.

 Determine the benefits, risks, and side effects of Allovectin-7 in this patient population.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive an intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 once weekly for 6 weeks.

 At week 9, a complete disease status assessment is performed.

 Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of 6 injections.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Gene Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Injecting allovectin-7 into a person's melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response that will kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment.
