(firstQuint)Phase III Randomized Study of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody (cA2) for Patients With Enterocutaneous Fistulae as a Complication of Crohn's Disease.

 PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to investigational site and number of fistulae (single vs multiple).

 Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an infusion of chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) on weeks 0, 2, and 6.

 Arm II: Patients receive an infusion of cA2 on weeks 0 and 2, and an infusion of placebo on week 6.

 Arm III: Patients receive an infusion of placebo on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, and 6.

 Patients are followed every month for 3 months, then every 6-12 months for up to 2 years.
