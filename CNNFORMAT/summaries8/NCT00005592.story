(secondQuint)Radioimmunotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the efficacy and safety of rituximab and ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy in patients with refractory or relapsed, low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8 immediately followed by IDEC-In2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 1.

 Patients also receive ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 8.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver radiation to them without harming normal cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and ibritumomab tiuxetan in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
