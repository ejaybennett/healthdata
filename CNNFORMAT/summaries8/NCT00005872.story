(secondQuint)Nitrocamptothecin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the response rate, time to progression and overall survival of patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer when treated with nitrocamptothecin.

 II.

 Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5.

 Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
