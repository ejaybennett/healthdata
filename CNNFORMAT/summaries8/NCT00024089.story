(secondQuint)Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the disease control rate, in terms of complete response, partial response, and stable disease for at least 4 months, in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck treated with gefitinib.

 II.

 Determine the effect of this drug on epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and expression of selected genes in these patients.

 III.

 Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
