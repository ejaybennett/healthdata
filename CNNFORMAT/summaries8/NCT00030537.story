(secondQuint)Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether a change in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation is detected in tumors of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with erlotinib.

 - Determine whether a change in other parameters of signal transduction that are downstream of EGFR (ERK and AKT) is detected in tumors of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 - Determine the response duration and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Correlate EGFR phosphorylation level with clinical findings and time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Correlate the pharmacokinetics of this drug with a change in EGFR phosphorylation in tumor biopsies of these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed within 4 weeks.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months.

 Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
