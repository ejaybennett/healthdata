(thirdQuint)Mistletoe in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Receiving Palliative Chemotherapy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether supplemental treatment with mistletoe increases immune function (as determined by total lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and lymphocyte subset analysis) in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.

 - Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

 - Correlate immune function and quality of life in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

 Patients receive mistletoe subcutaneously three times a week for 15 weeks.

 Dose of mistletoe is increased at weeks 2 and 3 and then every 3 weeks until a maximum response is seen, dose-limiting toxicity occurs, or the study ends.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.

RATIONALE: Mistletoe may help the body build an immune response and may improve quality of life to help patients live more comfortably.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying mistletoe to see how well it works in treating patients who are receiving palliative chemotherapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
