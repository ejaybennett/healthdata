(firstQuint)Cerebril in Patients With Lobar Hemorrhage Related to Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.

 Hemorrhagic Stroke due to CAA represents approximately 7% of all strokes.

 The current phase II clinical study investigates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the drug candidate in patients who have suffered lobar hemorrhages.

 The initial phase of the study is also aimed at determining the optimal dosing regimens for subsequent drug candidate efficacy trials.

 The trial is also evaluating the appearance of new cerebral hemorrhages on gradient-echo MRI scans, the amyloid ss (Ass) protein levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and the neurological and cognitive functions.
