(fifthQuint)Triptorelin With Either Exemestane or Tamoxifen in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer when treated with triptorelin and exemestane vs triptorelin and tamoxifen.

 - Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to planned use of concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of positive lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more).

 Treatment duration is 5 years.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.

 Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for 3 years.

 Triptorelin With Either Exemestane or Tamoxifen in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells.

 Hormone therapy using triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen.

 It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.
