(thirdQuint)Ro 50-3821 in Treating Anemia in Patients Receiving Antineoplastic Therapy for Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the hemoglobin dose response of anemic patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving antineoplastic therapy treated with 6 different regimens of Ro 50-3821.

 Secondary - Compare the safety profile of these regimens in these patients.

 - Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of these regimens in these patients.

 - Determine additional pharmacodynamic characteristics of these regimens in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multicenter study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms.

 In all arms, patients begin study therapy on the first day of a course of antineoplastic therapy.

 - Arm I: Patients receive a lower dose of Ro 50-3821 subcutaneously (SC) once weekly.

 - Arm II: Patients receive a medium dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once weekly.

 - Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once weekly.

 - Arm IV: Patients receive a lower dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks.

 - Arm V: Patients receive a medium dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks.

 - Arm VI: Patients receive a higher dose of Ro 50-3821 SC once every 3 weeks.

 In all arms, treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed at 1 week.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Ro 50-3821 may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients who are receiving antineoplastic therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying six different regimens of Ro 50-3821 to compare how well they work in treating anemia in patients who are receiving antineoplastic therapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
