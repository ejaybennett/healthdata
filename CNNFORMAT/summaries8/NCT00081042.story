(secondQuint)ABI-007 in Treating Patients With Inoperable Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Melanoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of ABI-007 in patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

 - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

 Secondary - Determine the time to disease progression, in terms of the rate and duration of response or stable disease, in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the effects of this drug on biomarkers of melanoma in these patients.

 - Correlate biomarker levels with response in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

 Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts according to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (previously treated vs chemotherapy-naive).

 - Cohort I (previously treated): Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 - Cohort II (chemotherapy-naive): Patients receive a higher dose of ABI-007 as in cohort I.

 In both cohorts, courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-70 patients (12-35 per cohort) will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ABI-007 works in treating patients with inoperable (unresectable) locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma.
