(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIB, Stage III, or Stage IV Colorectal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 causes an immune response in patients with stage IIB, III, or IV colorectal cancer.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, and 15.

 On day 22, patients undergo removal of the lymph node into which the vaccination site drains to determine whether the immune system is responding to the vaccine.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIB, Stage III, or Stage IV Colorectal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV colorectal cancer.
