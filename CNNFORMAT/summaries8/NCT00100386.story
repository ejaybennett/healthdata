(fifthQuint)Strategies to Reduce Transmission of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria in Intensive Care Units (STAR*ICU) Trial.

 This study will determine if rates of colonization and infection with 2 resistant Gram positive bacteria-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) among patients in adult intensive care units (ICUs) are lower in ICUs that use an intensive infection control strategy plus standard care compared to ICUs that use standard care alone.

 The intensive control strategy involves: 1) identifying patients who are colonized with MRSA or VRE by reporting the results of surveillance cultures of the anterior nares and stool or perianal area; 2) Universal Gloving (use of gloves during interactions with the patient or the patient's environment) until the patients are discharged or their surveillance culture results show they are not colonized with MRSA or VRE (whichever happens first); and 3) Contact Precautions (use of gloves and gowns during interactions with the patient or the patient's environment) during care of patients who are colonized with MRSA or VRE.

 Standard care involves proper hand hygiene (handwashing or use of a waterless hand antiseptic) and use of Standard Precautions (use of gloves and other barriers as needed for interactions involving contact with mucous membranes, wounds, and body fluids) and collection of surveillance cultures, but not reporting of results to these sites.

 The surveillance cultures will be performed by obtaining swabs of the nose and stool or perianal area from patients upon admission to the ICU, at weekly intervals thereafter, and upon discharge from the ICU.

 The results of the surveillance cultures will be used to compare the rate of colonization with MRSA and VRE in ICUs using the intensive control strategy with those that use standard care alone.

 Strategies to Reduce Transmission of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria in Intensive Care Units (STAR*ICU) Trial@highlight

Primary Outcome Measures:Incidence density of colonization with MRSA or VRE (number of new colonization events per 1000 patient days at risk) during the intervention phase.

 Secondary Outcome Measures:The effect of the 2 strategies on the incidence density of colonization with MRSA and VRE individually will be determined and compared descriptively.

 The effect of the strategies on the cumulative incidence of bacteremia caused by MRSA and VRE will be determined to assess the clinical relevance of the strategy in preventing infection.

 The trial will evaluate the frequency of hand hygiene and the use of gloves and gowns by healthcare workers to substantiate whether the effect of the intensive control strategy is mediated, as expected, by an increase in the use of gloves and gowns due to an increase in the number of patients cared for using Contact Precautions.
