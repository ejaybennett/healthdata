(thirdQuint)Low-risk Fever and Neutropenia in Children With Cancer: Safety and Efficacy of Oral Antibiotics in an Outpatient Setting.

 Details on antimicrobial therapy - At presentation with FN (fever and neutropenia) and during an initial inpatient observation period of 8 to 22 hours, empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics are given.

 Type and dosage are chosen by the treating physician.

 - Patients randomized to continued intravenous antibiotics continue with these antibiotics.

 - Patients randomized to oral antibiotics receive a combination of oral ciprofloxacin (25 to 30 mg/kg/day, top dose 1500 mg/day) plus oral amoxicillin (65 to 80 mg/kg/day, top dose 2250 mg/day), both given in two doses per day.

 - In both groups, the study gives guidelines (for certain situations) and rules (for other situations) when to change and when to stop antibiotics.

 Details on clinical and laboratory controls - During antibiotic therapy, patients are seen daily, either as inpatients or as outpatients according to randomization.

 Complete blood counts are performed at least every second day.

 - After stopping antibiotic therapy and until resolution of severe neutropenia (if applicable), patients are seen every other day, with a complete blood count.

 - Patients randomized to outpatient management have the possibility to contact at any time of the day (and night) a pediatric oncologist in case of problems, in order to discuss necessity for emergency control and/or rehospitalization.

 Low-risk Fever and Neutropenia in Children With Cancer: Safety and Efficacy of Oral Antibiotics in an Outpatient Setting@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in children with cancer presenting with fever in severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia at low risk for medical complications, oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting after an initial phase of intravenous antibiotics and in-hospital observation for 8 to 22 hours, is not inferior as to safety and efficacy compared to continued intravenous antibiotics given in-hospital.
