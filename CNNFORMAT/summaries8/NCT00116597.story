(fifthQuint)Active Specific Intranodal Immunotherapy of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus in Locally Advanced to Metastatic Melanoma.

 The investigators have conducted a phase I/II clinical trial based on the intradermal administration to stage III/IV melanoma patients of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding tumor associated antigens and costimulatory epitopes for the priming of immune responses, followed by boosts with corresponding synthetic peptides (Zajac P et al in Human Gene Ther 2003).

 Specific cytotoxic T cells could be induced in a majority of patients following priming, but sustained responsiveness could not be maintained by peptide boosting on a long term basis.

 Emerging evidence supports the notion that expansion of specific T cells requires trafficking of antigen presenting cells loaded with specific determinants to lymphatic nodes, as induced, among others, by pro-inflammatory stimuli.

 Therefore, we now adopt the intranodal injection of the immunogenic formulations.

 As for the former melanoma active specific immunotherapy trial, GM-CSF is used as a supporting cytokine.

 The epitopes considered are expressed, either all or some of them, in over 90% of the melanomas in Western countries; namely, we immunize with Mart-1/Melan-A epitope 27-35, Gp-100 epitope 280-288 and tyrosinase epitope 1-9.

 As a consequence, HLA-A2 positivity is mandatory for inclusion in the trial.

 The 2 costimulatory molecules expressed by cells infected with our replication-incompetent recombinant vaccinia virus are B7.

1 (CD80) and B7.

2 (CD86).

 Active Specific Intranodal Immunotherapy of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus in Locally Advanced to Metastatic Melanoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to assess intranodal immunotherapy in locally advanced to metastatic melanoma patients (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stages IIb to IV).

 For this, the investigators capitalize on their previous melanoma clinical trial (published by Zajac P et al in Human Gene Ther 2003) and take advantage of a proprietary recombinant vaccinia virus (replication inactivated) expressing 5 minigenes: 3 melanoma associated antigens and 2 costimulatory molecules.

 Immunization with the recombinant vaccinia virus is followed by 3 boosts with soluble, synthetic melanoma associated antigens.

 The patients are immunized intranodally (groin lymph node) under ultrasonographic guidance in an outpatient clinic.

 The protocol foresees 2 cycles of immunotherapy for alternate weeks and lasts 15 weeks.
