 II.

 Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

 III.

 Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

 IV.

 Determine the pharmacokinetic predictors of response to this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28.

 Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.

 Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
