(thirdQuint)Virological and Clinical Anti-Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Efficacy of Tenofovir and Emtricitabine in Patients With HIV/HBV co-Infection.

 This is a randomized multicentre trial of FTC vs TDF/FTC in antiretroviral naive subjects with HIV/HBV co-infection over 48 weeks (Clinical Trial A).

 Plus, a 12 week viral kinetic substudy comparing a subgroup of patients on Clinical Trial A is being conducted.

 (Substudy A1) Primary Objectives: - To compare the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA levels below the limit of detection (5x ULN) - To compare suppression of HIV-1 RNA and changes in CD4/CD8 counts over 48 weeks - To compare the effect of therapy on histological changes in the liver and the presence of ccc-DNA Enrollment: - 24 patients in Clinical trial A (of whom 16 enter substudy A1).

 Clinical Trial A: - Patients with HIV/HBV co-infection who are naive to HIV/HBV therapy, have detectable HBV viraemia and are willing to start antiretroviral therapy.

 Inclusion Criteria: - Written informed consent - Documented HIV infection - Age 18 - 70 years - HBV DNA > 106 copies/ml Randomization: - Arm 1: Zidovudine (AZT), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV) - Arm 2: Tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV).
