(thirdQuint)High-Dose Esterified Estrogens in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Failed Previous Hormone Therapy.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical response rate in postmenopausal women with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer that has failed prior sequential endocrine therapy treated with high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^(R)).

 Secondary - Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^(R)) 3 times daily.

 Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

 High-Dose Esterified Estrogens in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Failed Previous Hormone Therapy@highlight

RATIONALE: High doses of esterified estrogens may stop the growth of breast cancer cells that no longer respond to hormone therapy.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose esterified estrogens work in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that has failed previous hormone therapy.
