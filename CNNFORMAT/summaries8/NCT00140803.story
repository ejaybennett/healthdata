(fifthQuint)Study Of Combined VISUDYNE Therapy With Kenalog In CNV Secondary To Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

 This is a randomized, single-masked (VA examiners, angiographic graders), multi-center, Phase 2 study with 3 arms comparing VISUDYNE therapy in combination with intravitreal injection of either a 1 mg or 4 mg of triamcinolone with VISUDYNE therapy without intravitreal triamcinolone in a 1:1:1 ratio.

 Re-treatment may be administered at 3 month intervals ( 14 days) if evidence of CNV leakage is detected by fluorescein angiography.

 At baseline and at 3 month (+ 14 days) intervals patients will undergo the following assessments: ophthalmic examination, best corrected visual acuity, fluorescein angiography, and color fundus photography.

 The eligibility criteria for inclusion into the study and re-treatment of patients will be based on fluorescein angiography.

 Patients receiving treatment at day-1, week-3, and week-6 following the treatment will have best corrected ETDRS visual acuity testing and ophthalmic.

 Those patients not being re-treated will have will have best corrected ETDRS visual acuity testing and ophthalmic examination at week-6 following the re-treatment evaluation visit.

 Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study.

 Expected time for recruitment is 6 months; all patients will be followed for the period of 12 months in the study.

 Study Of Combined VISUDYNE Therapy With Kenalog In CNV Secondary To Age-Related Macular Degeneration@highlight

To determine whether VISUDYNE therapy in combination with 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone will reduce the average loss from baseline of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as compared with Visudyne therapy without intravitreal triamcinolone at 12 months in subjects with occult subfoveal and minimally classic subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD.

 The intravitreal triamcinolone will be given as either a 1 mg or 4 mg dose.

 This study will also evaluate the safety of Visudyne therapy in combination with intravitreal triamcinolone.

 An interim statistical readout will be performed when the first 60 patients have completed 6 months of follow-up evaluation.
