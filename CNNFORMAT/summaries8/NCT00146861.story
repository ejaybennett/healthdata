(firstQuint)LIFE Study - Limiting Chronotropic Incompetence for Pacemaker Recipients.

 The LIFE Study will estimate the prevalence of CI among a general sample of pacemaker patients and compare changes in quality of life and physical activity between patients randomized to receive rate response driven by either blended sensor or accelerometer.

 Changes in chronotropic response between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or accelerometer will be compared.

 A sub-study will evaluate changes in functional capacity between CI patients randomized to either blended sensor or accelerometer.

This study will compare how two different sensors inside the pacemaker may affect patients' quality of life.
