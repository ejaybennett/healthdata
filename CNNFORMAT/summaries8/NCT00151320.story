(fifthQuint)Phase I/II Trial of VELCADE + CHOP-Rituximab in Untreated DLCBL or Mantle Cell NHL.

 Standard CHOP chemotherapy administered every 21 days (full dose) for six cycles Rituximab administered (375 mg/m2) day 1 of each cycle (with usual premedications) VELCADE is administered prior to rituximab and CHOP on day 1 of each cycle.

 The dose of VELCADE will be determined by the following dose escalation schedule: Once completed six cycles of therapy (~18 weeks), patients will be evaluated every 3 months for the first year post treatment, then every 6 months until disease progression or death for years 2 through 5 post treatment.

 Patients who have disease progression will be contacted every 6 months until death to assess for survival status.
