(secondQuint)The Pharmacokinetics of Sirolimus When Combined With Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus in Renal Transplant Patients.

 The dose and pharmacokinetic of an immunosuppressant may differ in different ethnics, and different combinations.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-level relationship of sirolimus through pharmacokinetic study.

 The dose-level relationship of cyclosporine and tacrolimus was also assessed.

 From clinical outcome and blood level of sirolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus, we can design the most appropriate cyclosporine/sirolimus/steroid or tacrolimus/sirolimus/steroid dose regimen for Taiwanese.
