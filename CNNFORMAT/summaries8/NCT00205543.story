(firstQuint)Study of Effects of Sutures on Results of Palate Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, is the most common surgical procedure performed for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

 The procedure involves removal of redundant tissue from the lower palate (roof of mouth), including the uvula, and then suturing the cut edges of the remaining tissue together.

 However it is frequently noted by surgeons that sutures placed in the roof of the mouth do not stay intact.

 Also, in standard tonsillectomy, which involves removal of the tonsils and thus creation of a wound near the palate, no suturing is used, which does not seem to affect how the area heals.

 Previous studies have shown no significant differences in complication rates, post-operative pain, or symptom outcomes in patients undergoing tonsillectomy either with or without suture repair of the tonsillectomy wound.

 In this study we will examine whether suture repair following UPPP has any effect on post-operative pain, healing, or treatment success in terms of symptom resolution or post-operative sleep study results.
