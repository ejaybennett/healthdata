(thirdQuint)Improving Executive Functions After Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): A Clinical Trial of the "Executive Plus" Program.

 This is a randomized clinical trial comparing two approaches to post-TBI comprehensive day treatment.

 Executive Plus offers systematic treatment of post-TBI executive function deficits, through a focus on problem solving and emotional self-regulation, as well as systematic treatment of post-TBI attention deficits.

 It relies on modular, contextual, and embedded approaches to treatment.

 It will be compared to Mount Sinai's currently operating day treatment program.

 The 26-week programs will run concurrently and potential participants will be randomly assigned to Executive Plus or the standard program, using rolling admissions.

 Program staffs will be separate.

 Outcomes will be assessed using measures that focus on functioning within cognitive domains, across domains and in everyday life, and that assess long-term outcomes.

 Detailed manuals will be developed to guide the implementation of each program's operation.

 Improving Executive Functions After Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): A Clinical Trial of the "Executive Plus" Program@highlight

This is a randomized clinical trial which compares a standard day treatment program for individuals with TBI with the "Executive Plus" program; the latter emphasizes training of attention, emotional self-regulation and problem solving.

 The goal of the Executive Plus program is to maximize executive functioning, as well as the long-term outcomes of community participation and satisfaction with daily life.
