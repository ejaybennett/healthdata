(thirdQuint)The Study of the BX VELOCITY Stent In Patients With De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.

.

 This is a multicenter (up to 35 centers), prospective, randomized double blind study.

 This study has a 2-arm design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY stent to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY stent, both mounted on the Raptor Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery System.

 A total of 350 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis.

 Patients will be either randomized to the sirolimus coated or uncoated BX-VELOCITY stent.

 Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months.

 Medical resource use during the 5 years follow-up period will be collected and analyzed.

 The Study of the BX VELOCITY Stent In Patients With De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.

@highlight

The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY cent stent in maintaining minimum lumen diameter in de novo native coronary artery lesions as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY balloon-expandable stent.

 Both stents are mounted on the Raptor(R) Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery System.
