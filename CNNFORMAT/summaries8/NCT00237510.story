(secondQuint)Pilot Study of Terazosin in Treatment of Antidepressant Induced Excessive Sweating.

 Sweating is a common and bothersome side effect of treatment with antidepressants.

 Most or all antidepressants have been clearly shown to cause excessive sweating.

 It is unclear to what extent excessive sweating caused by antidepressants becomes less or goes away with time.

 In many instances, it continues to be a problem even after 6 or more months on the antidepressant.

 There is no generally accepted treatment for excessive sweating.

 This study has been designed to study whether terazosin is effective in reducing antidepressant-induced sweating, and whether it is well-tolerated and acceptable to patients.

 In addition, secondary objectives of this study are to determine the time taken for patients to respond to terazosin, the usual doses needed for improvement, and the extent of reduction in sweating.

 This information will not only help doctors in using terazosin for this purpose in their patients, but will help in designing further studies of this treatment.

This study is based on the hypothesis that terazosin, a blocker of alpha-1 receptors, will be effective in reducing excessive sweating caused by antidepressant treatment, and will have minimal adverse effects.
