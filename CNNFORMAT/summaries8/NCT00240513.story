(secondQuint)Study Comparing Acne in Patients Taking Oral Minocycline to Patients Taking Minocycline Plus Topical Tretinoin.

 Although oral antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment of inflammatory acne for 30 years, studies comparing their efficacy have little scientific value.

 Evidence-based dermatology proves minocycline to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris while the patient remains on the medication; however, the relapse rate of acne after a course of antibiotics has never been established.

 The relapse rate would appear to be significant, as repeated courses and long-term antibiotic use are commonly prescribed in practice.

 The increasing problem of drug resistance has raised issues of the suitability of such long term antibiotic treatment and this overuse is probably a contributing factor of multiple drug resistance in our society.
