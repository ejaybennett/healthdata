(secondQuint)Imaging Trial of the Distribution of Topical Gel in the Human Vagina: Enhanced MRI Techniques to Increase Resolution.

 This study will assess the distribution of topical gel in the human vagina, using enhanced MRI techniques.

 The number and size of uncovered areas will be studied, and the upper genital tract will be examined for the presence of topical gel using MRI.

 MRIs will be performed with both a standard pelvic coil and an enhanced resolution endo-rectal coil in order to obtain maximal resolution.

 MRI images will be acquired before and after simulated coitus.
