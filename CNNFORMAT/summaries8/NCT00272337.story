(firstQuint)Aspirin Dose and Atherosclerosis in Patients With Heart Disease.

 Aspirin reduces risks of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths from cardiovascular causes in patients who have survived a prior event as well as during an acute heart attack.

 Low dose aspirin is sufficient to achieve complete inhibition of platelet aggregability, or stickiness, and this is the mechanism whereby aspirin prevents formation of blood clots.

 Our research is designed to explore whether higher doses of aspirin provide additional benefits on markers of atherosclerosis.
