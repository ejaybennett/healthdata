A 6-month, observational, post authorization safety study for the collection and evaluation of additional safety data on topiramate as a prophylactic treatment for migraines in adult patients.

 According to current European and international guidelines the safety and efficacy of drugs will be continuously monitored even after their approval and market circulation.

The applicable methods of monitoring include: Observational studies, voluntarily reported adverse events, clinical trials of IV phase and Post Authorization Safety Studies ( PASS).

 Post Authorization Safety Studies (PASS) during the use of a product are a significant source of information regarding the action of the drug or a therapeutic method under the circumstances of every day clinical practice.
