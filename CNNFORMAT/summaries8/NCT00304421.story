(secondQuint)Comparison of the Nighttime Effects of Two Different Drugs on Subjects With GERD.

 Gastric acid secretion can be divided into two phases: the daytime phase and the nocturnal phase.

 Nocturnal acid reflux is presumably more damaging because of loss of salivary neutralization.

 The present study is designed to measure effects of rabeprazole and pantoprazole on post-prandial and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and intragastric pH in H.

 pylori-negative volunteers with gastroesophageal reflux disease.

 These measurement will be used to compare the degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion between the two drugs.
