(thirdQuint)Quality of Life in Female Breast Cancer Survivors and Their Spouse, Partner, or Acquaintance.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the quality of life (physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, and spiritual functioning) of female breast cancer survivors who were age 45 or younger at the time of diagnosis with the quality of life of female breast cancer survivors who were age 55 to 70 at time of diagnosis (considering type of surgical treatment [lumpectomy vs mastectomy], hormonal treatments, and time since diagnosis as covariates) and age-matched (to the younger group) females with no history of breast cancer.

 - Compare the quality of life (physical functioning, psychological functioning, social functioning, and spiritual functioning) of partners of breast cancer survivors who were age 45 or younger at time of diagnosis with the quality of life of partners of breast cancer survivors who were age 55 to 70 at diagnosis and partners of age-matched (to the younger group) females with no history of breast cancer.

 - Test and compare quality of life models that identify the variables that mediate between antecedent variables of personal characteristics, diagnostic and treatment characteristics, and quality of life outcomes in order to determine where interventions to improve quality of life should be targeted.

 - Explore the relationship of partner antecedent, mediating, and outcome variables as predictors or mediators of outcome variables for breast cancer survivors.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients, spouse or partner of patients, age-matched acquaintances of patients, and partner of acquaintances complete questionnaires over 60-90 minutes about personal characteristics, self-efficacy, coping, social support, health care provider communication, physical, psychological, social, and spiritual functioning, and quality of life.

 After completing the study questionnaires, patients and age-matched acquaintances of patients are interviewed via telephone over 30 minutes for cognitive function assessment.

 A random subset of patients and spouses/partners of patients are interviewed via telephone over 45-60 minutes, using data-generating and open-ended questions, regarding physical functioning, sexual and reproductive issues, psychological issues, social impact, and methods used to deal with breast cancer survivor concerns.

 Disease and treatment characteristics of patients are obtained from medical records.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,697 patients, spouse or partner of patients, age-matched female acquaintances of patients, and partner of acquaintances will be accrued for this study.
