(secondQuint)Effect of Betablocker or Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy on Patients With Liver Cirrhosis.

 Cardio-pulmonal complications to patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension determine the patients' prognosis.

 Most patients have hemodynamical changes in circulation with increased cardiac output and decreased systolic function in stress.

 Endothelial dysfunction is a parameter for bad prognosis in cardiovascular disease.

 The Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system plays an important role in natrium and volume regulation.

 Descriptions of changes in the peripheral circulation and oxygenation have been deficient up to now.

 Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are betablockers and/or aldosterone antagonists routine treatment - effects on peripheral hemodynamics and oxygenation in relation to central hemodynamic changes are deficient.

 Effect of Betablocker or Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy on Patients With Liver Cirrhosis@highlight

The studys purpose is to investigate the effect of beta blockade or aldosterone antagonist therapy on oxygenation, peripheral and cardiac hemodynamics and humoral systems, in patients with liver cirrhosis.
