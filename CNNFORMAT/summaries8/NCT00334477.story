(firstQuint)Efficacy and Safety of Tadalafil in Hemodialysis Patients.

 In our country, the number of patients in hemodialysis for the treatment of renal chronic dysfunction is very huge.

 As we know this group has a greater prevalence of sexual dysfunction than the general population, and among these dysfunctions erectile disfunction(ED) occupies maybe the most important position.

 With the advent of the increase aging of the nations population and the small number of organ donations, the number of men suffering from ED in hemodialysis surely will be very significant causing a very important problem for our health system.

 Up to now theres little indexed publications supporting the use of tadalafil in this special group of men.

 Another PDE 5 inhibitor, sildenafil, was used in this patients with success and safety but obviously we need other options with the same efficacy.

 We intend this study to give us more background to treat ED in this already unfortunate ones.
