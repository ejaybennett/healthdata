(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of CF101 to Treat Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca.

 At a Screening Visit, patients who provide written informed consent will have screening procedures performed, including a complete medical history, medication history, physical examination, including height, weight, sitting blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature, and clinical laboratory tests.

 Disease activity will be assessed using tear meniscus (TM) height, tear break-up time (BUT), fluorescein staining (FS), Schirmer test, and the Dry Eye Symptom Score (DESS).

 Doses of artificial tears must be stable for >2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

 Eligible patients will begin a 2-week run-in period, during which time they will be instructed to discontinue use of all topical ophthalmic medications except for lubricant eye drops.

 Patients who successfully complete the 2-week run-in period will be randomized to their assigned medication (CF101 1 mg or matching placebo) to be taken orally every q12h for 12 weeks.

 Patients will return for assessments and a new supply of study medication at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, and at Week 14 for a final follow-up assessment.
