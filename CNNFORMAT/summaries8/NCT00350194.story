(fifthQuint)The Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Metabolic Syndrome.

 This translational pilot study will have a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design.

 We will enroll one hundred subjects who meet at least 3 of the 5 criteria for metabolic syndrome as per NCEP guidelines/WHO guidelines and who do not have known cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

 They will receive either placebo or omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish oil capsules for a two-year period.

 Assessment of, C-IMT, serum lipoprotein profile, LDL- buoyancy, adiponectin, CRP, SAA, apolipoprotein B and A-1, fasting glucose, fasting insulin levels, and plasma fatty acids will be measured at baseline, one year, and two years.

 The Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish oil supplementation (approximately 2 grams per day) on the carotid intima-media (CIMT)progression (primary objective) and 2)(Secondary objective) lipid markers such as LDL, apo-B, and LDL buoyancy, on inflammatory burden as measured by CRP, on oxidative stress as measured by urinary isoprostanes, urine microalbumin/creatinine, and serum adiponectin a fat derived hormone in subjects with metabolic syndrome.
