(fifthQuint)A Study of the TAXUS Libert Stent for the Treatment of de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions in Small Vessels.

 TAXUS ATLAS Small Vessel is a global, multi-center, single-arm, trial of patients receiving the TAXUS Liberte-SR 2.

25 mm paclitaxel-eluting stent.

 The results will be compared with two different historical control groups.

 The first control group consists of a subset of lesion-matched TAXUS V patients treated with a 2.

25 mm TAXUS Express-SR paclitaxel-eluting stent.

 The objective of this analysis is to evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes of TAXUS Liberte-SR 2.

25 mm stent in de novo lesions versus the TAXUS Express-SR stent.

 The hypothesis is that the TAXUS Liberte-SR stent has non-inferior safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express-SR stent in the treatment of de novo lesions in small coronary vessels.

 The second control group consists of a subset of lesion-matched TAXUS V patients treated with either a 2.

5 mm or a 2.

25 mm bare metal Express stent.

 The objective of this analysis is to evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes of TAXUS Liberte-SR 2.

25 mm stent in de novo lesions versus the Express bare metal stent.

 The hypothesis is that the TAXUS Liberte-SR stent has superior safety and efficacy to the Express bare metal stent in the treatment of de novo lesions in small coronary vessels.

 A Study of the TAXUS Libert Stent for the Treatment of de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions in Small Vessels@highlight

TAXUS ATLAS Small Vessel is a global, multi-center, single-arm, trial of patients with coronary arteries less than 2.

5 mm in diameter who are treated with the TAXUS Liberte stent versus an historical TAXUS Express control derived from a subset of lesion-matched TAXUS V patients treated with a 2.

25 mm stent.

 The objective of the study is to evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes of TAXUS Liberte-SR 2.

25 mm stent in de novo lesions.

 The hypothesis is that the TAXUS Liberte-SR stent has non-inferior safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express-SR stent in the treatment of de novo lesions in small coronary vessels.
