(secondQuint)Extrapleural Intercostal Catheter vs.

 Thoracic Epidural for Thoracotomy Pain.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of thoracic epidural vs.

 continuous extra-pleural intercostal local anesthesia for the treatment of post thoracotomy pain in adult patients.

 Study patients will be randomized between the thoracic epidural and continuous extrapleural catheter groups[Figure 1].

 Because thoracic epidural anesthesia is the gold standard but continuous extrapleural intercostal local anesthesia is potentially easier and less prone to complications, the study will be structured as an "equivalence study".

 The null hypothesis (Ho) is that continuous intercostal nerve blockade is worse than epidural for post-thoracotomy pain management.

 Therefore, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is then that continuous intercostal nerve blockade is equal to or better than epidural for post-thoracotomy pain management.

 Extrapleural Intercostal Catheter vs.

 Thoracic Epidural for Thoracotomy Pain@highlight

We will compare thoracic epidural anesthesia which is presently used for management of pain after thoracotomy to an intra-operatively placed extrapleural intercostal catheter.

 The study wil be double blinded and prospective.
