(fifthQuint)Heparin or M-EDTA in Preventing Catheter-Related Infections and Blockages in Patients at High Risk for a Catheter-Related Infection.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the incidence of catheter-related infections (Staphylococcal and Candida) in patients at high risk for a catheter-related infection treated with heparin vs minocycline hydrochloride and edetate calcium disodium (M-EDTA).

 Secondary - Compare the incidence of catheter occlusions in patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to type of catheter (tunneled central venous catheter [CVC] vs nontunneled percutaneous CVC) and participating center.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive minocycline hydrochloride and edetate calcium disodium (M-EDTA) flush solution into the CVC once daily.

 - Arm II: Patients receive heparin flush solution into the CVC once daily.

 Treatment in both arms continues for up to 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or until the removal of the catheter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Heparin or M-EDTA in Preventing Catheter-Related Infections and Blockages in Patients at High Risk for a Catheter-Related Infection@highlight

RATIONALE: Heparin or M-EDTA may prevent catheter-related infections and blockages in patients at high risk for a catheter-related infection.

 It is not yet known whether heparin is more effective than M-EDTA in preventing catheter-related infections and blockages in patients at high risk for a catheter-related infection.

 PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying heparin to see how well it works compared with M-EDTA in preventing catheter-related infections and blockages in patients at high risk for a catheter-related infection.
