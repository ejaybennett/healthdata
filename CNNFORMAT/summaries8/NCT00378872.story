(firstQuint)Tranexamic Acid vs.

 Quixil - Reducing Blood Loss in Joint Replacement.

 This is a prospective randomised controlled trial to compare the benefits of Quixil vs.

 Tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss.

 Both medicines are used for the reduction of blood loss in major joint surgery; previous studies have shown each one to be effective and safe, but they have not been directly compared in this setting.

 We will compare the blood loss in each of 3 groups: tranexamic acid used, Quixil used, and control group (neither drug used).

 Blood loss is to be calculated from height, body weight and difference between pre and post-operation haematocrit.
