(thirdQuint)Carbon-11 Acetate and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET Scan of the Bone in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Spread to the Bone.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Correlate pre-treatment and 3-month post-treatment carbon-11 (^11C) acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (^18F-FDG PET) images with changes in clinical response measures in patients with bone-dominant metastatic prostate cancer.

 Secondary - Compare ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scanning results with bone scintigraphy in these patients to determine which best predicts clinical response.

 - Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with changes in prostate-specific antigen level.

 - Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with clinical symptom parameters (pain scale scores and analgesic usage scales).

 - Correlate ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scan response with clinical time to progression.

 - Determine if PET scan response can predict duration of progression-free survival.

 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

 Patients are stratified according to hormone response (sensitive [stratum 1] vs refractory [stratum 2]).

 Patients undergo carbon-11 acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography imaging prior to and 3 months after initiation of either androgen-deprivation therapy (stratum 1) or docetaxel (stratum 2).

 Pain and quality of life are assessed at baseline and at 3 months.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Carbon-11 Acetate and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET Scan of the Bone in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Spread to the Bone@highlight

RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as PET scan, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying carbon-11 acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan of the bone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to the bone.
