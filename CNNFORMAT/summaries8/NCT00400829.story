(thirdQuint)E7389 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate the antitumor activity of E7389 (eribulin mesylate), in terms of objective response rate, in patients with recurrent or progressive stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

 II.

 Evaluate the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 III.

 Evaluate the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed once monthly for at least 6 months and then periodically thereafter.

 E7389 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This phase II trial is studying how well E7389 works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as E7389, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
