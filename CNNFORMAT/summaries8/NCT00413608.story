(secondQuint)Influence of CYP2C19 Genetic Variants on Clopidogrel in Healthy Subjects.

 Thirty individuals genotyped for specific variants of 2C19 cytochrome and P2Y12 platelet ADP receptor will receive during one week a daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel.

 Depending on their pharmacodynamic response to this dose of clopidogrel, subjects will be affiliated to two groups, "good responders" and "bad responders".

 After a wash-out period, "bad responders" will receive a double dose of clopidogrel, while the "good responders" will receive 75 mg of clopidogrel, associated with a CYP2C19 inhibitor.

 Such study will allow to evaluate both the impact of raising daily dose of clopidogrel in patients with defected variants of 2C19 and potential interactions of clopidogrel with other drugs.
