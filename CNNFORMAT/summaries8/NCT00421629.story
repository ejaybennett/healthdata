(firstQuint)Experimental Study to Assess Interventions Aimed at Improving the Equity Impact of Community-Based Health Insurance.

 Community based health insurance is often cited as a means of improving access and financial protection in developing countries, but such schemes may not benefit the poorest.

 We evaluate alternative strategies for improving the uptake of benefits of a community based health insurance scheme by its poorest members.

 Comparisons: Three groups are compared to standard insurance scheme members (Control).

 One group is provided with after-sale service and supportive supervision (AfterSS).

 A second group is provided with prospective reimbursement (PR).

 A third group is provided with these two interventions together (Both).
