(secondQuint)CETRA: Neoadjuvant Caelyx and Trastuzumab in Her-2 Positive Breast Cancer.

 Chemotherapy in association with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, given before surgery, has been shown to reduce tumor size and permit better resection of HER-2 positive breast cancers.

 This study will evaluate the activity of a neoadjuvant treatment with docetaxel and trastuzumab given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by the combination of caelyx, cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.

 Patients will undergo breast cancer surgery 2-5 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

 Adjuvant therapy after surgery will be given according to existing guidelines, and will include an additional 10 cycles of trastuzumab.
