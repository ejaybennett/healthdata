(thirdQuint)Early Hospital Discharge or Standard Inpatient Care in Cancer Patients Receiving Antibiotics for Febrile Neutropenia.

 OBJECTIVES: - Identify cancer patients who are low-risk inpatients and meet criteria for early discharge (i.

e.

, symptomatic improvement and temperature 37.

8C) after receiving oral antibiotics for febrile neutropenia.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified by disease type (lymphoma vs solid tumor), duration of registration ( 48 hours), and participating center.

 Patients receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium 3 times daily and oral ciprofloxacin twice daily on admission to the hospital.

 Treatment continues for 7 days in the absence of clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients are assessed as inpatients after 24 and up to 72 hours after the first antibiotic dose.

 Patients showing clear response (i.

e.

, symptomatic improvement irrespective of neutrophil recovery, temperature 37.

8 C for 24 hours) and who continue to meet study eligibility criteria are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 - Arm I (early discharge): Patients are discharged home and instructed to remain in daily contact with hospital staff to report temperature and symptoms until completion of oral antibiotic regimen.

 - Arm II (standard management): Patients continue their antibiotic course in hospital and are discharged according to local guidelines and the following additional criteria: subjective improvement, afebrile ( 37C for 24 hours), and absolute neutrophil count 500/mm and rising.

 Patients in both arms complete a daily diary documenting daily temperature readings, symptoms, and toxicities.

 Patients also complete a Health Questionnaire and a Cancer Worries Inventory Booklet at baseline, in the hospital immediately after randomization, and at completion of oral antibiotics or resolution of neutropenic febrile episode.

 Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Finishing an antibiotic regimen at home may be as effective as receiving it in the hospital.

 It is not yet known whether early hospital discharge is as effective as standard inpatient care in cancer patients receiving antibiotics for febrile neutropenia.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying early hospital discharge and comparing it with standard inpatient care in cancer patients receiving antibiotics for febrile neutropenia.
