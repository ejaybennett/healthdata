(thirdQuint)The Effect of Training on Endothelial Function, Progression of Disease,Inflammation, Heart Rate Variability and Mental Health After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

 Pas er randomized to a 6 months training group or none training.

 At baseline and at 6 months patients are examined with blood tests to measure serum concentrations of inflammatory markers, a test for endothelial function, heart rate variability and a coronary angiogram.

 Further patients are asked to answer questionnaires concerning mental health (SF36, HADS).
