(firstQuint)Hemodynamic Changes After Aortic Aneurysm Treatment With Stent-Graft.

 This study will assess hemodynamic changes in aortas of patients after treatment of their abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with an FDA approved stent-graft (Zenith).

 This study does not require any change in clinical protocol to the the way the AAA procedures are currently done.

 Utilizing the catheters already employed in this procedure, intravascular blood pressure measurements will be documented at various times and at various anatomic levels prior to and after deployment of the stent-graft.

 As the compliant aortic aneurysm acts as a capacitor, expanding during systole and contracting during diastole, it is our hypothesis that endovascular AAA repair using a non-compliant stent-graft changes the aortic pulse profile.

To compare the aortic pulse profile before and after stent-graft implantation to prove that endovascular AAA repair using non-compliant stent-graft changes the aortic pulse profile.
