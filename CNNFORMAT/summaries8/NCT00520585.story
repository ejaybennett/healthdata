(thirdQuint)Study of Influence of Atorvastatin on the Repolarisation Phase of Cardiomyocytes.

 The group will consist of 40 healthy volunteers.

 The study will be mono-centric.

 The repolarisation phase of cardiomyocytes will be evaluated using long - term 12-lead digital ECG monitoring.

 There will be 3 single ECG recordings - randomly after 20 mg of atorvastin, 80 mg of atorvastatin and placebo, respectively.

 Study of Influence of Atorvastatin on the Repolarisation Phase of Cardiomyocytes@highlight

The aim of this study is to evaluate influence of atorvastin on the repolarisation phase of cardiomyocytes.

 If there is any, it could be a part of positive "non-lipid" effect of statins in therapy of ischaemic heart disease.

 Study hypothesis: atorvastin will decrease heterogeneity of repolarisation of cardiomyocytes in comparison with placebo
