(fifthQuint)Bortezomib, Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome, and Thalidomide as First-line Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I, II, or III Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients previously untreated stage I, II, or III multiple myeloma.

 Secondary - To evaluate the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

 - To determine the time to disease progression from the start of this therapy in patients treated with this regimen.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose oral thalidomide once a day on days 1-28, bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 15, and 18, and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

 Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients with residual disease who continue to show response after completion of 6 courses may receive 2 additional courses for a total of 8 courses.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

 Bortezomib, Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome, and Thalidomide as First-line Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I, II, or III Multiple Myeloma@highlight

RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Thalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

 Giving bortezomib together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and thalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and thalidomide works as first-line therapy in treating patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma.
