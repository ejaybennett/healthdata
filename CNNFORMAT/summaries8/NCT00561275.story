(firstQuint)Safety Study of Multiple Peptide Vaccine to Esophageal Cancer.

 LY6K (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus K) was identified as a new target of tumor associated antigen using cDNA microarray technologies combined with the expression profiles of normal and cancer tissues.

 On the other hand, anti-angiogenic therapy is now considered to be one of promising approaches to treat of cancer.

 In this clinical trial, we evaluate the safety and immune responses of multiple peptide cocktail including LY6K and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) together with IFA and GM-CSF as immunoadjuvants in patients who had LY6K expressed primary esophageal cancer.

 Toxicity profiles will be monitored, and antigen specific T cell responses will be described.
