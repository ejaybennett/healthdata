(firstQuint)PPARgamma Activation by Losartan in Hypertensive Patients: The Importance of Losartan-Metabolites.

 The losartan metabolite EXP3179 potently induces the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-) as a partial agonist in vitro.

 PPAR- is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a regulator of lipid- and glucose metabolism.

 PPAR- ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

 Angiotensin II receptor 1-blocking and PPAR--activating properties of losartan metabolites in patients would markedly improve the pharmacological profile of losartan by combining anti-hypertensive and highly beneficial metabolic actions.

 We developed the following hypothesis: 1.

 Hypertensive patients chronically treated with losartan exhibit sufficient plasma levels of EXP3179 to activate PPAR.

 2.

 PPAR target genes are induced in monocytes from losartan-treated patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether losartan metabolites are effective in inducing PPAR target genes in monocytes in losartan-treated patients.
