(fifthQuint)Irinotecan, Radiation Therapy, and Docetaxel With or Without Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the dose limiting toxicity and recommended phase II dose of docetaxel when given at escalating doses with weekly irinotecan hydrochloride and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

 - To determine the dose limiting toxicity of cisplatin, once the recommended phase II dose of docetaxel is established, when given weekly with docetaxel, irinotecan hydrochloride, and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

 Secondary - To evaluate the clinical and pathological complete response rate in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel and irinotecan hydrochloride with or without cisplatin followed by concurrent docetaxel and irinotecan hydrochloride with or without cisplatin plus radiotherapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive one of the following regimens.

 Regimen 2 is for patients recruited after the recommended phase II dose has been determined in patients recruited (who receive regimen 1).

 - Regimen 1: - Induction chemotherapy (weeks 1-6): Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Chemoradiotherapy (weeks 8-13): Beginning in week 8, patients receive docetaxel IV over 15 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 (week 8) and 8 (week 9).

 Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, in weeks 8-10.

 Treatment with chemoradiotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Regimen 2: - Induction chemotherapy (weeks 1-6): Patients receive docetaxel IV and irinotecan hydrochloride as in regimen 1 induction chemotherapy.

 They also receive cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride, docetaxel, and cisplatin repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Chemoradiotherapy (weeks 8-13): Patients receive docetaxel IV, irinotecan hydrochloride IV, and undergo radiotherapy as in regimen 1 chemoradiotherapy.

 Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on days 1 (week 8) and 8 (week 9).

 Treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride, docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

 Irinotecan, Radiation Therapy, and Docetaxel With or Without Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Irinotecan may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

 Irinotecan and docetaxel may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

 Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when given together with irinotecan and radiation therapy with or without cisplatin in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
