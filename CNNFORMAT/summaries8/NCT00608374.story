(fifthQuint)Chlorambucil or Fludarabine as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Waldenstrm Macroglobulinemia, Splenic Lymphoma, or Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare the efficacy of first-line therapy comprising chlorambucil vs fludarabine phosphate in patients with previously untreated Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, or non-IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients are stratified according to disease (Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia vs splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes vs non-IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma).

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral chlorambucil on days 1-10.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 - Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate orally or IV on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients undergo quality of life assessment at baseline.

 Chlorambucil or Fludarabine as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Waldenstrm Macroglobulinemia, Splenic Lymphoma, or Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as chlorambucil and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 It is not yet known whether chlorambucil is more effective than fludarabine in treating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, splenic lymphoma, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chlorambucil to see how well it works compared with fludarabine as first-line therapy in treating patients with previously untreated Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, splenic lymphoma, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
