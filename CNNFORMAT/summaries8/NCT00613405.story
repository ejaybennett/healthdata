(firstQuint)Stress and Marijuana Cue-elicited Craving and Reactivity.

 Although use of marijuana is widespread, little research has focused on the treatment of marijuana use disorders or on predictors of relapse.

 Although several factors contributing to relapse have been explored in other dependencies (i.

e.

, alcohol, cocaine), little research has focused on drug cue-related or stress-induced relapse in marijuana-dependent individuals.

 Cue reactivity is a construct measured in a laboratory procedure where an individual's subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses are assessed following exposure to drug-related environmental cues or stressors.

 Investigating the effects of drug-related environmental cues and stress in marijuana-dependent individuals will be useful in guiding treatment development.
