TELEDIAB-1 is a national, multicenter, controlled, randomised trial.

 The Primary objective of the TELEDIAB-1 study is to demonstrate that the PDA-FIT system (PDA-Phone and/or telemonitoring) is able to improve metabolic control of chronically uncontrolled type 1 diabetic patients, despite intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections with basal-bolus insulin or insulin pump), as compared with conventional care.

 Main judgment criteria: comparison of HbA1c means between the 3 groups at 6 months
