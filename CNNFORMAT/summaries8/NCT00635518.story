 Health care workers of the intervention health care service sites received training based on the programme "Ten steps for healthy feeding for children from birth to two years old".

 Pregnant women, in their third term, were enrolled in the study.

 At 6 and 12 months of age, the mothers were interviewed at home using a semi-structured questionnaire with pre-coded close- and open-ended questions and the children were evaluated.
