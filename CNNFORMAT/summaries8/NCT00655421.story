(secondQuint)Oral Cancer Screening in Mumbai, India by Primary Health Care Workers.

 Oral cancer is the most common cancer among men in India mainly due to the habit of using smokeless tobacco.

 Pre-cancerous lesions like leukoplakia, melanoplakia, erythroplakia,oral submucous fibrosis and indolent ulcers can be easily detected by periodic examination of the oral cavity of the at-risk populations.

 Several methods of oral cancer screening have been tried over the past three-four decades with varying success.

 This study investigates the feasibility of application and compares the test characteristics of three oral cancer screening techniques: Unaided Visual Inspection, VelScope assisted examination and examination after application of Toluidine blue dye by primary health care workers among tobacco users attending a cancer early detection clinic, in Mumbai, India.
