(thirdQuint)ALK21-013: Efficacy and Safety of Medisorb Naltrexone (VIVITROL) in Adults With Opioid Dependence.

 Part A was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of monthly treatment with VIVITROL compared to placebo in opioid-dependent adults.

 Subjects who completed Part A could choose to continue to Part B, which was an open-label extension to assess longer-term safety, durability of effect, health economics, and quality of life (QOL) in the continuing study population for up to 1 year.

 At the conclusion of both parts, each completing subject will have received a total of up to 19 injections of study drug over approximately 1.

5 years.

 Dosing was performed by the principal investigator or designated study staff member.

 All subjects received standardized, manual-based psychosocial support at each scheduled visit.

 Opioid use was tracked through urine drug testing and subjects' self reports.

 Other evaluations for efficacy and safety, health economics, and quality of life were routinely conducted throughout the study.
