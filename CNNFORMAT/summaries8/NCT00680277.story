(thirdQuint)Vitamin A Value of Spirulina Carotenoids in Humans.

 By utilizing novel stable isotope dilution techniques recently developed in our laboratory, we will trace deuterium labeled ss-carotene in intrinsically labeled spirulina, which is harvested from a hydroponic system.

 In the mean time, we will track 13C10 labeled vitamin A in humans.

 In this way we will determine absorption of ss-carotene from spirulina matrix and the conversion of the spirulina ss-Carotene to retinol.

 This will enable us quantitatively determine the vitamin A equivalence of spirulina.

 The specific aims of this study are: 1.

 To determine labeled ss-C blood response kinetics following an acute dose of intrinsically labeled spirulina; 2.

 To determine labeled retinol blood response from the intrinsically labeled spirulina; 3.

 To determine 13C10 retinol blood response from the isotope reference material 13C10 retinyl acetate; 4.

 To determine s spirulina-vitamin A equivalence.

 Vitamin A Value of Spirulina Carotenoids in Humans@highlight

The goal of this protocol is to determine the vitamin A value (equivalence) of spirulina.

 The investigation will use intrinsically deuterium labeled spirulina and an isotope vitamin A reference dose, 13C10- retinyl acetate (13C10 RAc), in males (n=20).

 Up to 45 blood samples (10 ml/sample) will be collected from each subject over a two-month period to evaluate the bioavailability and bioconversion of spirulina ss-carotene to vitamin A.
