(secondQuint)Effects of Cranberry Extractive on the Lipid Profiles in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes.

 Hypercholesterolemia is a notorious risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

 It had been reported cranberry consumption increased nearly 8% of circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in non-diabetic subjects.

 Although characteristics of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL and high triglyceride, the benefits of concentrated powder of cranberry juice on lipid profiles were not evident in type 2 diabetic subjects with diet control alone.

 To the best of our knowledge, the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in type 2 diabetic subjects using oral anti-diabetic drugs have never been studied, especially total to HDL cholesterol ratio which is important in predicting cardiovascular diseases in Asian and/or diabetic population.

 Furthermore, cranberry has anti-oxidative effect which is associated with reduction of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol in non-diabetes.

 Therefore, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to assess the effect of cranberry on lipid profiles in type 2 diabetes.

Cranberry, containing flavonoids, is effective on improvement of lipid profiles in non-diabetic subjects.
