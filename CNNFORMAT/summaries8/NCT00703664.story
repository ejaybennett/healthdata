(thirdQuint)Bortezomib and Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma or Recurrent and/or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Estimate the response rates of mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas to bortezomib and vorinostat combination therapy.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess the safety and tolerability of the study regimen.

 II.

 Observe progression-free survival and response durations.

 III.

 Observe the relationship between pretreatment lymphoma cell nuclear v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (relA) and response.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12.

 Patients also receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

 Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

 Bortezomib and Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma or Recurrent and/or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well bortezomib and vorinostat work in treating patients with recurrent mantle cell lymphoma or recurrent and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

 Bortezomib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
