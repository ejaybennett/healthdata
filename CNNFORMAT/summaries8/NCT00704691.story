(thirdQuint)Lenalidomide Therapy for Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory, Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas.

 Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL's) represent a subgroup of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with poor prognostic features.

 Compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas, PTCL's often present with more advanced disease and sustain less durable remissions following treatment with chemotherapy.

 With standard anthracycline-based regimens such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), PTCLs achieve inferior 5-year overall survival rates of around 40% compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas whose 5-year overall survival rates reach 50-60%.

 While several salvage regimens have been established for B-cell lymphomas with moderate success, the guidelines for patients with relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's are less clear.

 Several reports suggest that the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs(R)) have clinical activity in this setting.

 The aim of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the activity of lenalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's.

The purpose of this study is to: - assess the effectiveness of lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with relapsed and or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphomas; and, - assess the safety of lenalidomide.

 There are reports suggesting a therapeutic benefit of thalidomide in patients with refractory and/or relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma's (NHL) which have led to the formal investigation of lenalidomide in the treatment of relapsed NHL's.
