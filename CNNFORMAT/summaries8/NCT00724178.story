 Measurements: Blood for measurement of serum 25(OH)D levels will be obtained from all HIV-infected children and adolescents by the participating clinical sites.

 Samples will be analyzed and the results known in advance of the cross-sectional study visit.

 Serum 25(OH)D levels will be used to select participants.

 The following measures will be performed: Medical history, including medications Pregnancy test for females of child bearing capacity Height and weight Assessment of pubertal stage Assessment of dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D Assessment of physical activity Determination of total body bone mineral content (TBBMC), total body bone mineral density (TBBBMD), spinal BMC and BMD, and bone age radiograph Fasting morning blood draw for indices of mineral metabolism: serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, total alkaline phosphatase activity, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, iPTH, urinary calcium and creatinine.

 Markers of bone turnover: Serum N-telopeptide (N-tx, a marker of resorption), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and osteocalcin (markers of formation) These measures will be performed in the SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit.

 Study design: The double-blind, randomized trial will compare the effect of 24 months of supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium to placebo on bone mineral accrual.

 Sixty HIV-infected children and adolescents, aged 8-16, will be randomized to receive vitamin D3 plus calcium or placebo.

 The primary outcome variables, BMC and BMD, will be measured before, and 1 and 2 years after randomization.

 Serial measurements of serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, markers of bone turnover will be assessed before and at defined intervals during the study.

b.

 Treatment arms: Eligible subjects will be assigned by randomization to receive either: 1.

 Vitamin D3 (100,000 IU or 2.

5 mg) administered orally every 60 days and elemental calcium 500 mg twice daily; or 2.

 Vitamin D3 placebo administered orally every 60 days plus calcium placebo twice daily.

 Entry and randomization visit: All eligible subjects will have the initial study entry evaluation performed at the SLRHC Pediatric Body Composition Unit by virtue of their participation in the cross-sectional study (Section D.

2.

f).

 As the qualifying serum 25(OH)D level will be known prior to the cross-sectional study visit, study participants eligible for the randomized clinical trial can be randomly assigned (see Methods) during the cross-sectional study visit to one of the two treatment arms; in such cases, the cross-sectional visit will also function as the entry/baseline visit.

 Each subject will be given the first dose of vitamin D3/placebo and the first 30 day supply of calcium/placebo will be dispensed.

 Follow-up Visits: Participants will be seen monthly during the first year of the study and every two months during the second year.

 Entry/baseline, 12-month and 24-month visits will take place at the SLRHC Body Composition Unit.

 All other visits will take place at the site where usual care is received.

 Vitamin D3/placebo will be administered during study visits every 2 months.

 At monthly visits during the first year and every 2 months during the second year after randomization, a 30 or 60 day supply of calcium/placebo will be dispensed.

 Adherence to calcium supplementation will be assessed at each visit.

5 mg/dl, albumin-corrected) develops, the dose of calcium will be reduced by 250 mg/day and the levels rechecked one week later.

 If the abnormality does not resolve, weekly stepwise reductions in oral calcium will be followed until a normal level is achieved or supplemental calcium is discontinued.

 Vitamin D3 or placebo will be withheld until serum calcium returns to normal.

 Subjects with persistent abnormality will be referred to the treating physician.

 Vitamin D3 or placebo will be withheld until serum calcium returns to normal.

 If severe hypercalcemia develops (>12.

0 mg/dl), all calcium supplements and Vitamin D/placebo will be discontinued immediately and the subjects will be withdrawn from the study.

 Hypercalceria If hypercalciuria develops (urinary calcium /creatinine ratio >0.

25 on spot urine specimens), the subject will have a 24 hour urine collection performed for confirmation.

 For confirmed hypercalciuria (>4mg/kg/24 hr), the dose of calcium will be reduced by 250mg and a spot urine repeated one week later.

 If the abnormality does not resolve, weekly stepwise reductions in calcium will be followed until hypercalceria resolves or supplemental calcium is discontinued.

 If necessary, vitamin D3 or placebo will be withheld until urine calcium returns to normal.

 If hypocalcemia develops (73 will be withdrawn from the study and referred to their medical provider for treatment and withdrawn from the study Monitoring for vitamin D deficiency During the first year on study, serum for measurement of 25-OH and iPTH will be drawn monthly and every 2 months during the second study year.

 Each subject's specimens will be frozen immediately after collection, and transferred to SLRHC where they will be stored at -70 degrees.

 At one year intervals the each subjects' samples will be assayed in "batched " fashion.

 On the basis of these annual determinations, subjects with persistent vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD73) that lasts throughout both winter and summer months, will be withdrawn from the study and referred to their medical provider.

 We anticipate low incidence of these particular abnormalities.

 In a prior study in which the same dose of vitamin D3 (100,000 IU) was administered every 60 days for 6 months, Guillemant et al.

 reported no instances of hypercalcemia in French adolescent males, ages 13-16, with seasonal vitamin D deficiency (Guillemant 2000).

 In addition, in an on-going study conducted by Dr.

 Shane (Prevention of Osteoporosis After Cardiac Transplantation, ROI AR 46124-04), among the 74 subjects receiving the metabolically active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol (0.

25 ug BID), there were only 4 episodes of urinary calcium excretion >400 mg/g creatinine.

 Besides being on calcitriol, these subjects were receiving corticosteroids, which also increase urinary calcium excretion.

 Corticosteroids are not a permitted co-administered medication in the present study.

 We do not anticipate Vitamin D3 will have an adverse effect on HIV infection or antiretroviral medications.

 However, HIV-infected subjects who experience an otherwise unexplained decline in immune status, based on CD4 count or CD4%, or an increase in measure of HIV viral load believed by the treating physician to be possibly related to study medications will be withdrawn from study participation.

 Measurements of CD4 count, CD%, and HIV viral load will be measured at the clinical care sites as per standard of care.

 Results will be monitored by the treating physician.

 Subjects who have decline in TBBMC z-score of >0.

5 from baseline at the one year on-treatment DXA will be discontinued from study and referred for additional clinical evaluation by the treating physician.

 In addition, if low impact or repeated fractures occur, a clinical evaluation by the treating physician, safety officer and Study PI will determine if the subject should remain on study.

Monitoring DXA scan results of study subjects will be performed by Dr.

 Horlick, a Co-Investigator and Director of the Pediatric Body Composition Laboratory at St.

 Luke's-Roosevelt.

 Finally, because this is a placebo-controlled trial involving children, we have elected to include an interim data analysis to be performed on 12 month on-treatment data (Human Subjects, Section E.

).

 A Data Safety and Monitoring Board comprised of experts in biostatistics, pediatric HIV disease, pediatric endocrinology, and pediatric bone acquisition will be established as per NIH guidelines to monitor study results for safety and efficacy, to establish criteria for early termination of the study in consultation with the Principal and Co-Investigators, and to determine if and when these criteria have been fulfilled.

n Data analysis and power calculations Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral accrual in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.

 The primary hypothesis of this study is that BMC and BMD will increase in HIV-infected subjects randomized to receive vitamin D3 plus calcium compared to subjects receiving placebo.

 We will test this hypothesis by comparing TBBMC, TBBMD, SBMC, and SBMD measured by total body and spine DXA scans performed at baseline and at 1 and 2 years post-randomization in the 2 study arms using an intention-to-treat analysis.

 A repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to analyze the bone accrual data.

 Differences in bone mineral content between the treatment and placebo groups will be compared at 1 and 2 years while controlling for any possible differences between the groups at entry to the trial.

 The between-group main effect (vitamin D3 and calcium versus placebo) will test whether there is an overall difference between the groups, while the within-group x time interaction effect will test whether the difference between the groups is constant over the two follow-up years.

 The magnitude of change in the vitamin D3 and calcium group will also be compared against normative data from the BMDCS to determine how many children in each group achieve levels within normal limits (95 % CI) using the algorithm presented in preliminary studies section C.

5.

 Based on our prior pilot data, the mean yearly change in TBBMC in 30 HIV-infected children between the ages of 7-14 years was 120 g with a standard deviation of 84.

 A difference in SD between boys and girls was noted.

 In order to maintain conservative estimates we chose SD observed in girls.

 This can be assumed to be the level of yearly change that will be observed in the placebo group.

 Based on data from the Pediatric Rosetta Project (NIDDK 37352), a cross-sectional study of >1300 children, the mean yearly change in TBBMC in healthy African-American and Hispanic children ages 7-14 years is 195 g.

 The effect size (d) comparing a mean yearly change of 120 g in the placebo group versus a change of 195 g in the Vitamin D3 and calcium group is therefore 0.

89.

 Twenty-one children in each group will be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with alpha = 0.

05 and beta = 80%.

 If the sample size is increased to 30 children in each group, power will be sufficient to detect a difference of 61 gm between the vitamin D3 and calcium group and the placebo group with alpha = 0.

05 and power = 80%.

 This is comparable to the difference observed in a clinical trial of healthy adolescent girls (mean age, 11.

9 years) who received either calcium (110% of RDA) or placebo (Lloyd 1996).

 Differences in the rate of sexual maturation during the study between treatment groups may "unbalance" the groups with respect to a factor of significance to the bone mass outcomes.

 To address this we have included a standardized measurement pubertal stage for use as a covariate in the analyses.

 Specific Aim #2: Determine the effect of HIV infection and vitamin D and calcium supplementation on indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone turnover.

 We hypothesize that indices of mineral metabolism are abnormal (low serum 25(OH)D and elevated PTH) and biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption are increased in HIV-infected children on HAART compared to normal controls and that indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone formation and resorption will return toward normal in HIV-infected children and adolescents who are randomized to receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

 We will test this hypothesis first by comparing markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin, BALP and N-Tx) in HIV-infected and healthy children and adolescents enrolled in the cross-sectional study using independent samples t-test to compare means.

 Longitudinal changes in bone turnover markers in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and calcium supplement will also be compared to those receiving placebo.

 Levels of vitamin D metabolites and markers of bone turnover ((osteocalcin, BALP and N-Tx) taken at intervals will be analyzed using a mixed model regression to model trends in these measures over time to evaluate dependent inter-relationships between these variables.

 Specific Aim #3: Evaluate vitamin D stores in HIV-infected children and adolescent receiving HAART.

 We hypothesize that vitamin D stores are decreased in children with HIV infection compared to healthy controls.

 We will test this by comparing serum levels of vitamin D metabolites and indices of mineral metabolism (25(OH)D 1,25(OH)2D) and PTH) in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART compared to healthy controls.

 Data for testing this will be obtained from the cross-sectional study.

 The HIV-infected group will consist of a sample of HIV+ children screened for recruitment into the study while the healthy group will consist of similar aged children recruited from the same neighborhood (including healthy siblings of the HIV positive children).

 Screening levels of serum vitamin D metabolites and PTH in the HIV-positive children will be compared with levels in the healthy children using an independent samples t-test.

 The main variable of interest is 25(OH)D as it best reflects vitamin D stores.

 Based on prior pilot data, the mean (SD) expected 25(OH) among HIV-infected subjects is 21 (11) ng/ml.

 The sample size in the present study has 80% power to detect change in 25(OH) D of 8 ng/ml with alpha=0.

05.

 Analysis of covariance based on a general linear regression model will then be used to determine whether any possible group differences remain after controlling for other factors such as race, sex, estimated dietary intake of Vitamin D and sunlight exposure (using month of study as surrogate for sunlight exposure).

 Specific Aim #4: Evaluate if vitamin D stores are a determinant of bone mass in HIV- infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.

 Our hypothesis is that among HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART, vitamin D stores, as measured by serum 25(OH)D, is a significant determinant of bone mass.

 We will assess the relationship these variables have to TBBMC in HIV-infected children and adolescents.

 This will be conducted through analysis of data obtained from a sample of at least 60 HIV-infected children and adolescent being screened for the enrollment in the longitudinal clinical trial.

 Within the HIV positive group, linear regression will be used to determine whether HIV-related factors including antiviral medications, markers of immunodeficiency (CD4count), HIV viral load, and levels of cytokines play a role in predicting serum vitamin D levels and bone mass.

 Additional co-variates that will be included in the model include age, sex, race, height, weight and pubertal stage.

 These analyses are especially critical measurements for inclusion in this clinical trial and in the analyses as these will allow for development of potential mechanistic pathways for both the etiology of abnormal bone mass and intermediate response variables involved in amelioration.

 Using multiple regression modeling we will assess the relationships of TNF, IL-6 vitamin D levels and TBBMC.

 It is estimated that 50% of the HIV positive children who are screened will meet the inclusion criteria for the trial and that approximately 100 to 120 HIV positive children will be available for the cross sectional comparison and so an equal number of healthy children will be also recruited.

 With a total of 200 children, the sample size will be large enough to add up to 18 covariates in addition to the grouping factor (HIV-positive versus healthy) and test for a 5% increase in R2, with alpha = 0.

05 and power = 80 %.

 A sample of 100 HIV-positive children alone will allow for a regression analysis that includes up to 9 predictors which collectively explain at least 15% of the variance of the outcome variable (TBBMC, etc.

) with alpha = 0.

05 and power = 80 %.

 The Effect of Vitamin D and Calcium on Bone in Pediatric HIV@highlight

We have observed that vitamin D deficiency, as evidenced by low serum 25(OH)D concentrations, is common in children and adolescents with HIV infection.

 To determine whether vitamin D and calcium supplementation improve bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected children and adolescents, we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing supplementation with oral vitamin D and calcium to placebo.

 The specific aims of this project are to: 1.

 Determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on bone mineral accrual in HIV-infected children.

 We hypothesize that BMC and BMD will increase to a greater extent in HIV-infected children who receive supplementation with vitamin D and calcium.

 This hypothesis will be tested by comparing changes in BMC and BMD, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), after one and two years of treatment in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation compared to those receiving placebo.

 2.

 Determine the effect of HIV infection and vitamin D and calcium supplementation on indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone turnover.

 We hypothesize that indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone formation and resorption will return toward normal in HIV-infected children and adolescents who are randomized to receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

 We will test these hypotheses by comparing longitudinal changes in indices of mineral metabolism and bone turnover markers in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and calcium supplement versus those receiving placebo 3.

 Evaluate if vitamin D stores are a determinant of bone mass in HIV infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.

 We hypothesize that vitamin D stores, as assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, are an important determinant of bone mass in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART.

 We will test this hypothesis by evaluating whether measurements of bone mass are associated with vitamin D stores, as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and other indices of mineral metabolism, in treated HAART-treated HIV-infected children and adolescents.
