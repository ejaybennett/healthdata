5% Icodextrin Peritoneal Dialysis Solution in Once-Daily Long Dwell Exchange.

 A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel controlled study has been conducted for 5 weeks in 201 CAPD patients.

 These patients were randomized from 7 centers with 98 allocated to the Icodextrin group and 103 to the Dextrose group.

 Before study, conventional glucose-based solution was the only dialysate which can available in China.

 Extraneal(R) is one of peritoneal dialysate produced by Baxter which contains 7.

5% Icodextrin.

 Patients involved the study were allocated to Dianeal group and Extraneal group in randomize.

 In Dianeal group, prescription was unchanged, while in Extraneal group, Extraneal dialysate was used instead of 2.

5% Dianeal.

 Assessments at baseline, week 2, and week 4 included drain volume and levels of glucose, creatinine, and urea in the dialysate drained from the long dwell; physical examination; vital signs; drained body weight; laboratory analyses.

 Daily net peritoneal ultrafiltration, daily peritoneal creatine clearance and daily peritoneal urea nitrogen clearance were recorded prior to and 2 week, 4 week after commencing Extraneal.

5% Icodextrin Peritoneal Dialysis Solution in Once-Daily Long Dwell Exchange@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 7.

5% Icodextrin peritoneal dialysis solution for once-daily long dwell exchange in patients undergoing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) in Chinese uremic patients.

Patients were divided into Dianeal group or Extraneal group for long dwell time.

 Net ultrafiltration, small solute clearance and relationship between different transport group were used to evaluate efficacy of Icodextrin.

 Physical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests were used to evaluate safety of Icodextrin.
