(secondQuint)Proximal Protection With The Mo.

Ma Device During Carotid Stenting.

 Test Device: Mo.

Ma cent Proximal Flow Blockage Cerebral Protection Device.

 Single size catheter device with a 9 French introducer sheath compatible shaft (outer diameter) and a 6 French compatible working channel (inner diameter), integrating two compliant balloons intended to achieve endovascular clamping of external carotid arteries (ECA) 3-6 mm in diameter and common carotid arteries (CCA) 5-13 mm in diameter.

 Primary Objective: Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Mo.

Ma device for cerebral protection in the treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses, which may or may not involve the bifurcation of the CCA, in subjects considered to be at high surgical risk for complications during carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

 Primary Endpoint: Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) within 30 days of implantation.

 MACCE are defined as: any myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death through day 30 post-procedure.
