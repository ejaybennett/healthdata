(secondQuint)Alemtuzumab and Rituximab in the Treatment of Refractory Autoimmune Cytopenias.

 Autoimmune cytopenias are a common entities with good responses to steroids therapies as first line, but there is a considerable percentage of patients who relapse, become refractory or dependant on steroids to maintain an acceptable level of hemoglobin or platelets, and the treatment becomes more difficult increasing the secondary effects.

 The current study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the combination of low doses of alemtuzumab (anti CD52) and Rituximab (anti CD 20) as a second line treatment option for this subset of patients improving the cytopenias without increasing the adverse effects.
