(fifthQuint)Attitudes and Beliefs and the Steps of HIV Care.

 The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically improved the survival of patients with HIV in the US.

 The effectiveness of HAART in routine care is determined by the success with which patients are able to follow certain crucial Steps of HIV Care.

 This 'Steps of HIV Care' framework is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) "Serostatus Approach to Fighting the HIV Epidemic," which has been overlaid with patient and process of care factors.

 It includes 1) access outpatient care, 2) utilize care and treatment services, and 3) adhere to care, including medications and appointments.

 Attitudes and Beliefs and the Steps of HIV Care@highlight

Through a prospective observational cohort study enrolling patients newly diagnosed with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Aim 1: Assess attitudes and beliefs about HIV disease and care over time and relate those attitudes and beliefs to success in following the Steps of HIV Care.

 Aim 2: Validate a simple visual analogue scale for assessing adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients newly starting HAART in routine care.

 Aim 3: Implement latent growth curve analysis for modeling changes in attitudes and beliefs over time, and for assessing the impact of the components of the Steps of HIV Care model on health outcomes.
