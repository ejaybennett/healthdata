(firstQuint)Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Intravenous Topiramate in Adult Patients.

 The long-term goal of this research project is to develop a more effective, safer therapy for neonatal seizures.

 Prior to using an investigational intravenous topiramate formulation in children and neonates, the pharmacokinetics and safety of the formulation must be demonstrated in adults.

 The immediate aims of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of a novel intravenous topiramate formulation.

 An additional aim is to determine if sex, advancing age, or genotype affects topiramate absorption, distribution, or elimination.
