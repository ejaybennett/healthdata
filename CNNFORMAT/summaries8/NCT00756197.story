(secondQuint)CryoSpray Ablation(TM)to Determine Safety and Feasibility in Radiation Induced Proctitis.

 The proposed study is a single center, ten patient pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of sprayed liquid nitrogen through a catheter via endoscope in subjects with radiation proctitis.

 There will be two groups.

 Subjects in Group 1 will receive a cryospray applied to healthy tissue for 10 seconds.

 The cryospray will be repeated four (4) times in sequential fashion for a total of 40 seconds of cryospray therapy.

 Subjects in Group 2 will receive a cryospray applied to healthy tissue for 20 seconds.

 The cryospray will be repeated two (2) times in sequential fashion for a total of 40 seconds of cryospray therapy.

 CryoSpray Ablation(TM)to Determine Safety and Feasibility in Radiation Induced Proctitis@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tissue response, and subject side effects of liquid nitrogen sprayed through a catheter (CryoSpray AblationTM, "CSA" or "cryospray therapy") via endoscope in subjects with radiation induced proctitis.
