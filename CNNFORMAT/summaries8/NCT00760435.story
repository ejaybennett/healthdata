(secondQuint)Infliximab Plus Intravenous Immunoglobulin for the Primary Treatment of Kawasaki Disease.

 KD, an orphan disease of low prevalence in U.

S.

 children, causes significant long term cardiac sequelae in a subset of patients.

 KD patients that are resistant to therapy are more likely to develop coronary artery abnormalities.

 This phase III placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of infliximab plus standard therapy vs.

 placebo plus standard therapy in acute KD will determine if the addition of infliximab to primary therapy can reduce the percentage of children resistant to therapy.
