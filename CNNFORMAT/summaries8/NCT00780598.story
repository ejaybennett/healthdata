(firstQuint)Safety and Anti-Disease Activity of Oral Tosedostat (CHR-2797) in Elderly Subjects With Refractory or Relapsed AML.

 There is an urgent need for novel compounds and treatment strategies for elderly patients with AML, particularly those with refractory or relapsed disease for whom there are few effective treatment options.

 Treatment options for elderly patients are further limited by co-morbidity and tolerability constraints.

 Tosedostat is a new aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in preclinical experiments has shown potent activity in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models as a single agent.

 In early clinical studies particularly good results have been observed in refractory and relapsed AML in older patients and these observations form the basis for the current study.

 This multi-center, open label phase II study will enrol approximately 70 subjects in Part A and 130 subjects in Part B.
