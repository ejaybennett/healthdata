(secondQuint)Can SMOFlipid, A Composite Parenteral Nutrition Lipid Emulsion, Prevent Progression Of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease In Infants?.

 Parenteral nutrition (PN) associated liver disease (PNALD), remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in infants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and intestinal failure.

 Although, the etiology is likely multi-factorial, lipids within parenteral nutrition solution have been implicated in its development.

 The standard lipid used in PN is typically, a soy based lipid (eg: Intralipid(R) - Fresenius Kabi) that primarily contains omega-6 fatty acids (6FAs).

 Animal and human studies have suggested that addition of omega-3 fatty acids (3FAs) to parenteral nutrition may decrease the incidence of hepatic injury, as well as have beneficial immunologic effects.

 SMOFlipid(R) (Fresenius Kabi) is a composite lipid emulsion, which contains polyunsaturated 3 and 6FAs, monounsaturated FAs, as well as medium chain FAs as integral constituents.

 All components (Soy-bean oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive oil, fish oil) have been used in humans, and the drug is approved for use in children in Europe.

 Based on its composition, we believe that this lipid preparation has the potential to prevent progression of liver disease in infants with SBS who are demonstrating evidence of liver dysfunction.

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a trial to examine the efficacy of an 3FA (Omega-3 fatty acid) containing balanced lipid emulsion in the prevention of progression of PNALD in infants with Intestinal Failure/Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and early liver dysfunction.
