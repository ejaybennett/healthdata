(thirdQuint)Insulin Resistance and Substrate Metabolism After Acute Erythropoietin (EPO) Administration.

 Recently EPO receptors have been found in human muscle tissue, but what is still not known is what the physiological role of these receptors are.

 It has previously been shown that Growth Hormone mediate insulin resistance.

 The GH receptor and EPO receptor belong to the same family of cytokine receptors, and thereby share many of the same signalling pathways.

 In this study we want to investigate if there is a similar effect on insulin resistance and/or substrate metabolism after acute administration of EPO in human muscle tissue.

 Different signalling pathways are investigated pa western blotting, and insulin sensitivity are measured be a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and substrate metabolism is measured by the forearm model.
