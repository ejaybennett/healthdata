(fifthQuint)Rehabilitation of the Upper Extremity With Enhanced Proprioceptive Feedback Following Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury.

 Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) affects over 200,000 people in the USA, with several thousand new injuries each year.

 Most recovery, following SCI, occurs in the six months following surgery.

 Further recovery after 12 months is unusual.

 In this study 20 subjects, more than 1 year post injury, will be enrolled to test the safety and efficacy of a new type of robotic therapy device known as the AMES device.

 The aim of this Phase I/II study is to investigate the use of assisted movement and enhanced sensation (AMES) technology in hand rehabilitation of incomplete SCI subjects.

The purpose of this study is to determine if tetraplegic individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) who remain unable to move their arms normally 1 year after their SCIs are able to sense and move the affected arm(s) better after 10-13 weeks of treatment with a new robotic therapy device.

 The hypothesis is that using the AMES device on the arm(s) of chronic tetraplegic subjects with incomplete SCI will result in improved strength, sensation, and functional movement in treated limb(s).
