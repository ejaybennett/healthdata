(firstQuint)Probiotic Administartion to Mothers of Preterm Infants to Prevent Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Sepsis.

 Oral probiotics have previously been shown to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.

 A few reports of sepsis by a probiotic bacteria have impeded implementation of oral probiotic supplementation in most NICUs.

 Considering the proven immunomodulatory effect of maternal probiotics on breastfed infants of atopic mothers, we would like to explore the indirect effects of maternal probiotics on preterm infants.

We hypothesize that supplementing maternal diet with probiotics will decrease the incidence of feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in preterm infants fed breastmilk.
