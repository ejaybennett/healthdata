(secondQuint)Collecting and Storing Samples of Blood From Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Healthy Participants.

 OBJECTIVES: - Establish a central pancreatic cancer specimen (including serum and peripheral blood lymphocytes) repository to serve as a resource for current or future scientific studies.

 - Utilize the clinical database to perform clinicopathologic correlation with the results of those studies.

 - Test new hypotheses as they emerge.

 OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

 Blood is collected from patients with pancreatic cancer at baseline and then every 3-6 months for up to 2 years.

 All other participants have blood collected at baseline and complete questionnaires at baseline and then every 3-6 months for up to 2 years.
