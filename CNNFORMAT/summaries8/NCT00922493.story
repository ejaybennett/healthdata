(fifthQuint)Inspiratory Muscle Training in Weaning.

 The sample for this investigation was selected in a randomized way in the period between December 2007 and November 2008.

 The individuals were successively entered in the research as they were admitted to the ICU, in respect of the criteria of inclusion and exclusion.

 From the total number of admitted patients in the period (n=67), many were excluded because they had been tracheostomized (n=25), were dead (n=13) or were transferred out of the hospital (n=1).

 Those that remained intubated (n=28) and went to the spontaneous mode were chosen randomly and in alternating fashion were divided into the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG).

 The EG (n=14; age=824 years-old) underwent conventional physiotherapy plus inspiratory muscular training with threshold IMT(R) (Respironics/EUA - 2004), and the CG (n=14; age=816 years-old) received only conventional physiotherapy with no intervention that favored the inspiratory muscle strengthening.

 As inclusion criteria, the individuals of the sample were required to have undergone MV for at least 48 hours in a controlled way13, as intubation is diagnostic for acute respiratory injury type 1 and has a maximum value of MIP of -20 cmH2O16.

 Exclusion criteria included any type of acute condition (cardiac arrhythmia) or chronic condition, such as insufficient congestive heart failure or unstable ischemic cardiac disease17, that could compromise weaning or could impede the accomplishment of inspiratory muscle training (neuropathy and myopathy).

 Tracheostomized patients (in the pre-test), those with neurological problems (cerebral vascular accident, cerebrospinal trauma or spinal medullar trauma), those with morbid obesity or those taking medicine that could cause a disorder of attention, as well as cases of auto-extubation, were also excluded.

 The criteria of inclusion and exclusion were evaluated via examination of the patients' medical records and physical examination daily and in each session.

 The daily adherence of the patients to the necessary parameters for the study was noted for each patient.

 Inspiratory Muscle Training in Weaning@highlight

Background: the objective of the present inquiry was to evaluate the weaning process in intubated older people subjected to inspiratory muscle training and to correlate the predictors of ventilatory interruption with its success.

 Methods: the patients were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG, n=14; age=824 years) that received conventional physiotherapy plus inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with threshold IMT(R) and a control group (CG, n=14; age=816 years) that received only conventional physiotherapy.

 The predictors evaluates were the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and the index of Tobin (IT).

 The protocol for muscle training consisted of an initial load of 30% MIP, which was increased by 10% daily; training was administered for five minutes, twice a day, seven times a week with supplemental oxygen for the entire period from the decision to wean up to extubation.
