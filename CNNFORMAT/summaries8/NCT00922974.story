(thirdQuint)Image-Guided Radiosurgery or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Spine Metastasis.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility of successfully delivering image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with spine metastases in a cooperative group setting.

 (Phase II) (completed as of 8-30-11) - Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT (single dose of 16 Gy) improves pain control (as measured by the 11-point Numerical Rating Pain Scale [NRPS]) compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy (single dose of 8 Gy).

 (Phase III) Secondary - Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT improves the rapidity of pain response and increases the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy, as measured by the NRPS.

 (Phase III) - Compare adverse events associated with these treatment regimens, as measured by NCI CTCAE v3.

0 criteria.

 (Phase III) - Evaluate the long-term effects (24 months) of image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT on the vertebral bone (e.

g.

, compression fracture) and the spinal cord, as measured by MRI.

 (Phase III) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase II study (completed as of 8-30-11) followed by a randomized phase III study.

 Patients enrolled in the phase III portion are stratified according to the number of spine metastases to be treated (1 vs 2-3) and the type of tumor (radioresistant [including soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas] vs other).

 - Phase II: Patients undergo 1 high-dose image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment over 60 minutes.

 (completed as of 8-30-11) - Phase III: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients undergo 1 high-dose image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT treatment over 60 minutes.

 - Arm II: Patients undergo 1 standard-dose external beam radiotherapy treatment over 5 minutes.

 Patients undergo MRI of the treated spine at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months*.

 Patients enrolled in the phase III portion also complete the Numerical Rating Pain Scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after randomization, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

 NOTE: *Patients enrolled in the phase II portion undergo MRI at baseline and at 3 months.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Image-Guided Radiosurgery or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Spine Metastasis@highlight

RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy works and compares it to external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with localized spine metastasis.
