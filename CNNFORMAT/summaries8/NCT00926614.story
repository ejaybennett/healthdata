(secondQuint)Efficacy of Actos Lipitor Pegasys & Ribavirin in CHC GT 1 Patients Who Relapsed or Nonresponded to Peg/Riba.

 The study will evaluate the use of atorvastatin and pioglitazone in the pre-treatment of insulin resistance and lipid levels prior to the addition of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

 If improvement is seen in insulin resistance patients may then be in a position to respond more favorably to current antiviral therapy consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

 This study could demonstrate the value of pretreating and continuing treatment for insulin resistance with pioglitazone in CHC, genotype 1 patients who have previously not responded or relapsed to prior pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment.

 Changes in lipids are not a primary or secondary endpoint in this study.

The aim of the study will be to determine if an insulin sensitizing thiazolidinedione plus a lipid lowering agent (statin) improves sustained virologic response rates in patients who have previously not responded or relapsed on standard pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy.
