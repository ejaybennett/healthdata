(secondQuint)Impact of Varenicline on Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Activation on Smokers.

 Treatment with varenicline reduces overall subjective cigarette craving and smoking reward in nicotine-dependent smokers.

 This preliminary study will explore the impact of varenicline treatment on smoking cue-induced craving and associated regional brain activation using BOLD fMRI.

 Twenty healthy smokers (10 males, 10 females) will undergo two BOLD fMRI scans with the presentation of smoking-related and neutral cues at baseline and after five weeks of treatment with open-label varenicline.

 The investigators hypothesize that participants will report reduced urges to smoke on the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief and have less activation of the brain areas associated with craving during the fMRI after 5 weeks of varenicline and smoking cessation counseling compared to the baseline scan.

 Impact of Varenicline on Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Activation on Smokers@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of varenicline treatment on cue induced craving to smoking using brain imaging.

 The investigators hypothesize that participants will report reduced urges to smoke and will have less activation in parts of the brain associated with craving.
