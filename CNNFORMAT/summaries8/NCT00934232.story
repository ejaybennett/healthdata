(fifthQuint)Busulfan in Multiple Myeloma.

 This study is for first line treatment for multiple myeloma patients in patients >65 years or have renal insufficiency Busulfan introduces cytopenia much slower than melphalan while the time to recover after transplantation is the same.

 The duration of cytopenia with busulfan should therefore be shorter.

 Busulfan given in myeloma patients with renal failure has proven to be effective.

 The initial proposed dose level in our study will be 3.

2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 3 days.

 The next levels will be 3.

2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 4 days, 4.

3 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 3 days, 5.

6 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days, and 6.

4 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days.

 Three patients per group will be entered at the first level.

 Further enrollment will be dependent upon toxicities observed.

 All dose escalations will be initiated after the PI has reviewed the toxicity data available on the prior dose levels and confirms that it is safe to proceed to subsequent dose level(s).

 Maximum tolerated dose will defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 of 6 patients experiences a grade 4 non-hematological toxicity that is unexpected, related, and serious, and it will be evaluated separately for patients > 65 years of age or in patients with renal insufficiency.

 Busulfan in Multiple Myeloma@highlight

Two main objectives of the study are: Primary: To determine the MTD of Busulfex (R) that can be given safely over the least number of days to myeloma patients who are either 65 years of age (Group 1) or have renal insufficiency (Group 2), defined as creatinine >3mg/dL or creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.

 Secondary: To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to evaluate individual variability and the relationship to toxicities in each of the two groups at each proposed dose level.
