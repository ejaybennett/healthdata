(thirdQuint)Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography in Evaluating Response to Dasatinib in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if changes in regional fluoride incorporation, measured by 18F-fluoride PET (SUV and Ki), occur in both castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases and normal bone as a response to treatment with dasatinib.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine if changes in 18F-fluoride transport (K1), an indicator of blood flow, and therefore, an indirect marker of angiogenesis, occur in both castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases and normal bone as a response to treatment with dasatinib.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET scan at baseline and then at 12 weeks after initiation of treatment with dasatinib.

 PET parameters (SUV, Ki, and Kl) are also analyzed.

This phase II trial is studying how well fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) works in evaluating response to dasatinib in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases.

 Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.
