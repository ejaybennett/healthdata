(firstQuint)Early Endoscopic Indicators for OACs After Lung Transplantation: Development of a Novel Mucosal Healing Score.

 The investigators evaluated lung transplant recipients prospectively.

 Adult patients surviving 90 day after LTx will be included.

 The investigators propose a classification of airway healing based on the endoscopic bronchial appearances at days 7, 14, 21, 90, 180 and 365 after LTx.

 A score system including mucosal healing, full tissue necrosis (=dehiscence), lose sutures, fibrin plugs, polyps and malacia will be developed (max.

 score 8 points/date).

 Endoscopic findings will be correlated with the development of obstructive airway complications (OAC, requiring >1 intervention).

 Afterwards the new score system will be applied prospectively in the patients.

Airway complications are a significant cause of morbidity after lung transplantation (LTx).

 Bronchoscopic evaluation may help to identify risk factors for requiring interventions later.
