(fifthQuint)Prospective Trial on Immunochemotherapy Plus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and Allogenic SCT in Primary Mantle-Cell-Lymphoma.

 With a median overall survival of approximately 3 years, MCL has the poorest prognosis of all NHL entities.

 No potentially curative therapy has been established yet as even more intensive therapies including high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous SCT show only moderate improvement of the prognosis of MCL.

 Allogenic SCT seems to have an immunological mechanism of action in NHL, which is commonly known as Graft-versus-Lymphoma effect.

 This trials purpose is to improve the overall survival in patients younger than 55 years with primary MCL by sequentially combining autologous SCT and allogenic SCT after the application of 6 courses of immunochemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy.

 Prospective Trial on Immunochemotherapy Plus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) and Allogenic SCT in Primary Mantle-Cell-Lymphoma@highlight

The purpose of this study is to improve the overall survival of Mantle-Cell-Lymphoma (MCL) by a new concept of treatment with primary curative intention consisting of six courses of immunochemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and HLA-identical allogenic SCT after a dose-reduced conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (TBI) with 2 Gy and Fludarabine in younger patients with primary Mantle-Cell-Lymphoma
