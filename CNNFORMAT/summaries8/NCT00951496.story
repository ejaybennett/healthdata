(fifthQuint)Bevacizumab and Intravenous or Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage II-III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if one or both of the proposed intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens improves the progression-free survival (PFS) event rate compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

 II.

 If both intraperitoneal (IP) regimens significantly improve the PFS event rate compared to the standard regimen, then a second study objective is to determine whether IP cisplatin and intravenous (IV) paclitaxel on day one plus IP paclitaxel on day eight improves the PFS event rate when compared to the IP carboplatin and IV paclitaxel.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine if intraperitoneal chemotherapy reduces the overall death rate compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy.

 II.

 To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.

0.

 III.

 To compare the patient-reported outcomes on: Quality of Life (Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian-Trial Outcome Index [FACT-O-TOI]), Neuropathy (FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group/Neurotoxicity [GOG/NTX4] scale), Abdominal discomfort (FACT-GOG/AD scale), Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue scale), and Nausea (item from FACT-O-TOI).

 IV.

 To assess the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study treatments.

 TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and examine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events.

 II.

 To bank archival tumor for research and examine the association between tumor markers and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events.

 III.

 Patients will be encouraged to enroll on the companion translational research protocol (CEM0703 under development).

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

 Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 in courses 2-6.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive bevacizumab alone in courses 7-22 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and carboplatin IP on day 1.

 Patients also receive bevacizumab as in Arm I.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as in Arm I.

 ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IP on day 2, and paclitaxel IP on day 8.

 Patients also receive bevacizumab as in Arm I.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as in Arm I.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

 Bevacizumab and Intravenous or Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage II-III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase III trial studies bevacizumab and intravenous (given into a vein) chemotherapy to see how well they work compared with bevacizumab and intraperitoneal (given into the abdominal cavity) chemotherapy in treating patients with stage II-III ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab together with intravenous chemotherapy is more effective than giving bevacizumab together with intraperitoneal chemotherapy in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.
