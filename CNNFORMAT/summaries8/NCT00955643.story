(firstQuint)Periodontal Treatment Associated With Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.

 Materials and Methods: In 20 patients diagnosed with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (pockets>7mm) with bleeding on probing, SRP was rendered in all pockets.

 Additionally, five consecutive hyperbaric sessions were administered in 10 patients after random allocation (SRP+HBOT).

 Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline up to 6 months: plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment level and BANA test.

 Results: SRP+HBOT resulted in greater probing reduction and attachment gain than SRP alone 3 months after treatment (p0.

05).

 Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy had a short-term beneficial effect on pocket reduction and bacterial elimination, and may be considered a potential therapy option to improve the clinical outcomes of scaling in severe cases of chronic periodontitis.
