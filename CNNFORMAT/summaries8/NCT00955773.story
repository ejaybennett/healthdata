(thirdQuint)A Study of the GSK MEK Inhibitor GSK1120212 and Everolimus in Cancer Subjects.

 MEK112110 is a dose-escalation, open-label study to determine the recommended dose and regimen for the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with everolimus in subjects with solid tumors.

 This will be accomplished using a dose-escalation procedure starting at low doses of GSK1120212 and everolimus.

 Dose escalation will continue based on predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified.

 The recommended doses and regimens will be selected based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.

 The clinical activity of GSK1120212 dosed in combination with everolimus will be explored further in an expansion cohort consisting of 20 subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 In addition a substudy will be conducted in 40 subjects with KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.
