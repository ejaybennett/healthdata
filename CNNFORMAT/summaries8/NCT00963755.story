(thirdQuint)F-18-Fluorocholine PET/CT and MR Imaging/ Spectroscopy in the Management of Primary and Recurrent Prostate Cancer.

 1.

 To evaluate the utility of F-18-FCH-PET/CT and MR imaging with 3-D MR spectroscopy in detecting, localizing, and estimating the volume of initial primary prostate cancer as compared to the current standard work-up using TRUS-guided biopsy.

 All imaging findings will be correlated with "gold standard" step slice histological examination.

 The hypothesis is that the combination of noninvasive imaging will improve the preoperative work-up as compared to the current approach.

 2.

 To evaluate FCH-PET for the restaging of prostate cancer after biochemical relapse in a large patient cohort.

 This will run in parallel to the work-up of primary prostate cancer, as the FCH radiopharmaceutical will be available during the time of study at absolutely no cost to patients or CHUV.

 A number of studies have demonstrated the benefits of F-18-FCH-PET/CT for these patients and this indication is currently not reimbursed by Swiss obligatory health insurance providers.

 F-18-Fluorocholine PET/CT and MR Imaging/ Spectroscopy in the Management of Primary and Recurrent Prostate Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that realization of guided biopsies by multimodal imaging with 18F-fluorocholine PET / CT and MR Imaging/spectroscopy would allow to increase the rate of detection prostate cancer compared with the current approach and give an information about location and tumoral volume before surgery.
