(firstQuint)The Effects of Kuvan on Functional Brain Connectivity in Individuals With Phenylketonuria (PKU).

 The proposed study is designed to evaluate the hypothesis that functional connectivity may represent an early marker for neurocognitive improvements related to Kuvan treatment.

 As a first step in the study, 20 patients with PKU who are 6 years of age will receive baseline functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) evaluations before being treated with Kuvan cent .

 Response to Kuvan cent will be monitored for 4 weeks.

 At the end of 4 weeks, response to Kuvan cent will be reviewed and all 20 patients will receive follow-up fcMRI evaluations.

 Fifteen patients with a reduction of 20% in blood phenylalanine will continue in the study and receive a third fcMRI evaluation at the end of 6 months of treatment with Kuvan cent .

 For comparison purposes and to control for possible practice effects in repeated testing, a matched control group of 20 healthy individuals without PKU will used.

 All 20 of the control subjects will receive baseline and 4-week fcMRI evaluations; fifteen will receive a 6-month evaluation.

The objective of the study is to determine whether Kuvan cent (sapropterin) improves the strength of the functional connectivity between brain regions in individuals with PKU.
