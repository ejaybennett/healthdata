(fifthQuint)Vorinostat, Rituximab, and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To find a safe dose of vorinostat to be used in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) (vorinostat-R-CHOP).

 (Phase I) II.

 To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with vorinostat and R-CHOP therapy (vorinostat-R-CHOP).

 (Phase II) III.

 To estimate the response rate (complete and partial) and 2-year overall survival rate.

 (Phase II) IV.

 To evaluate the toxicity of vorinostat-R-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.

 (Phase II) V.

 To assess whether pre-treatment acetylation status of histones, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, and/or percentage of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with progression-free survival.

 (Phase II) VI.

 To explore whether treatment with vorinostat-R-CHOP increases histone acetylation, alters expression of MHC class II proteins, or alters percentage of T-cell subsets (CD8+, CD4+, forkhead box P3 [FOXP3]+) or infiltrating macrophages.

 (Phase II) VII.

 To explore whether histone acetylation status of tumor tissues correlates with MHC class II expression of peripheral blood B cells and lymphocyte subsets.

 (Phase II) VIII.

 To explore whether the change in systemic levels of immune cytokines with vorinostat-R-CHOP correlates with lymphoma symptoms, response, progression-free or overall survival.

 (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 or 1-9 (according to dose level), rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 3.

 Patients also receive prednisone PO once daily on days 3-7.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.

 Vorinostat, Rituximab, and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma@highlight

This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II, stage III, or stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

 Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cell growth in different ways.

 Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

 Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cell-killing substances to them.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving vorinostat together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.
