(firstQuint)The Effect on Depressive Symptoms in ECF Residents With COPD.

 We are studying 35 residents in the ECF with a diagnosis of COPD.

 We are evaluating them for depressive symptoms using the Cornell Depression Scale and the MDS 3.

0 section D.

 We are selecting patients who are not currently on treatment with Advair and starting them on Advair Diskus50/250 1 inhalation bid for a period of 16 weeks and reassessing the Cornell Depression SCale and MDS3.

0 section D looking for any changes.

 We are also going to measure FEV1 and FVC using spirometry before treatment and at the end of 16 weeks.

 This is a pilot study.

 The numbers are not necessarily adequate to achieve statistical difference-we are looking for trends.
