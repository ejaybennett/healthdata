(firstQuint)Assessing Glucose Effects of Sitagliptin (Januvia) in Adult Patients With Type 1 Diabetes.

 Improved post prandial glucose control with multiple daily injections of insulin in the DCCT study demonstrated significant reductions in microvascular complication.

 Similar to type 2 diabetes, patients with type 1 diabetes have a paradoxical increase in glucagon after meals which contribute to worsening post prandial glucose control.

 This proposed study is designed to determine if altering the glucagon axis by giving sitagliptin can improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of sitagliptin on glucose variability both after meals and overnight in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.
