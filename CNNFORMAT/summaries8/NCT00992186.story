(secondQuint)A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Single-agent Carlumab (an Anti-Chemokine Ligand 2 [CCL2]) in Participants With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.

 This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter trial (conducted in more than one center) in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

 The trial consists of 3 phases: screening period, treatment period of approximately 4 months, and a follow-up period (Week 1, 4, 8 and 12 after the last dose) of up to 12 weeks after the administration of last dose.

 The participants will receive carlumab at the dose of 15 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) by intravenous (into a vein) infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) at a constant rate over a 90 minute period once every 2 weeks until disease progression.

 Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated by composite response.

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
