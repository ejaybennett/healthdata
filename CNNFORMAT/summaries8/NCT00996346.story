(fifthQuint)Phase I/II Study of Irinotecan and Temsirolimus in Patients With Refractory Sarcomas.

 Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are anti-neoplastic agents with a wide potential range of clinical applications.

 The topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan is a potent DNA damaging drug.

 mTOR appears to enhance cancer cell survival following DNA damage, so it's reasonable to expect that mTOR inhibition combined with irinotecan may result in synergistic activity.

 This is a single arm, non-randomized phase I trial of temsirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) and irinotecan (a topoisomerase I inhibitor) in refractory soft tissue sarcoma patients.

 Successive groups of three patients will be entered at escalating dose levels.

 Irinotecan and temsirolimus will be administered weekly for three weeks followed by one week of rest.

 One course will therefore be four weeks.

 No intra-patient dose escalation will be allowed.

 Each patient will be treated until disease progression or intolerable side effects develop.

 Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed and the maximum tolerated dose will be reported.

 Note that this trial was originally designed as a phase I/II study, but only the phase I portion was completed and will be reported.

 Phase I/II Study of Irinotecan and Temsirolimus in Patients With Refractory Sarcomas@highlight

Refractory soft tissue sarcoma remains a difficult malignancy to treat.

 The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an enzyme that plays an important role in cancer cell survival.

 mTOR inhibitors, like temsirolimus, have shown activity in sarcoma.

 Irinotecan is a chemotherapy drug that has also been used to treat sarcoma.

 However, it is unknown whether combining these two drugs would result in improved efficacy with acceptable toxicity.

 Therefore, the goal of this phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile of combination temsirolimus and irinotecan both administered intravenously on a weekly basis to refractory soft tissue sarcoma patients.
