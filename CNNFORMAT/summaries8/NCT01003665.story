(thirdQuint)Comparison of Continuous Non-invasive Arterial Pressure (CNAP) With Invasive Arterial Pressure Monitoring.

 The CNAP monitor continuously measures blood pressure using a finger cuff.

 It showed a good agreement to invasive blood pressure measurements during anaesthesia induction and maintenance during surgery.

 In critical ill patients cardiac arrhythmia is probably a confounding factor affecting accuracy and interchangeability of CNAP.

 As systolic arterial CNAP pressure in comparison to mean pressure shows no statistical interchangeability with invasive measurements, mean pressure should be considered when making therapy decisions.

 A problem is the missing standard criterion for comparison of continuously devices with invasive pressure.
