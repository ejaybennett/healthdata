(secondQuint)Study of Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr) Antibody, Cetuximab, in Combination With Gemcitabine/Carboplatin in Patients With Stage IV Lung Cancer.

 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of Cetuximab when used in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with EGFr positive, chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 Also, the study will determine the response rate in patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin as well as determine the time to progression in patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV NSCLC treated with Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
