(firstQuint)Surgical Versus Conservative Treatment of Acute Mallet Fingers; a Randomised Controlled Trial.

 The investigators will randomise patients to receive splinting of their finger while their tendon heals or have surgical intervention.

 Surgical intervention will entail fixing the tendon with bone anchors and splinting.

 Conservative treament involves splinting while the tendon heals.

 We will then monitor the functional outcome of the hand using the DASH questionare over 18 months.
