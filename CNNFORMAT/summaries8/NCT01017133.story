(secondQuint)Fluorine F18-EF5 and Fludeoxyglucose F18 Positron Emission Tomography in Assessing Hypoxia and Glycolysis in Patients With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fluorine F18-EF5 and fludeoxyglucose F18 positron emission tomography in assessing hypoxia and glycolysis in patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and hypoxia as determine by 18F-EF5 PET scanning in patients with NSCLC.

 II.

 To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and increased glycolysis as determined by 18F-FDG PET imaging in patients with NSCLC.

 OUTLINE: Within 6 weeks prior to surgery, patients undergo fluorine F18 (18F)-EF5 PET at 10 minutes and 90 minutes after injection of 18F-EF5.

 Patients also undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 (18F-FDG) PET at 1 hour and 3 hours after injection of 18FFDG.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography, using the drug fluorine F18-EF5 to find oxygen and fludeoxyglucose F18 to find sugar in tumor cells may help in planning treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
