(firstQuint)Posture and Pulmonary Function of Mouth-breathing Children.

 Mouth-breathing children presents changes in stomatognathic system, which results in head projection, tension augment in scapular belt muscles and postural adaptations.

 Although thoracic shape and posture can influence ventilatory dynamics, we didn't find studies addressing pulmonary function of mouth-breathing children.

 This was a transversal study, designed to analyze the posture of mouth-breathing children, and verify the existence of correlation between posture and pulmonary volumes.
