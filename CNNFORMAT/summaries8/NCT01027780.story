(thirdQuint)Mindfulness to Improve Elders' Immune and Health Status.

 This study investigates the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on immune responses to multiple concentrations of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in elderly volunteers.

 The research design thus capitalizes on the antibody response to a novel, benign antigen to which our subjects will be immunologically naive.

 The use of a range of antigen concentrations will provide a sensitive indicator for the effects of intervention.

 The Aims of the study are the following: 1.

 To examine the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on immunological outcomes, perceived health, and psychological well-being in a sample of seniors 65 years of age and older.

 2.

 To examine whether treatment effects are moderated by age, personality traits, physical health status, or depression.

 3.

 To examine the effects of behavioral, psychological, and physiological mediators of immune outcome.
