(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Sodium Nitrite in Sickle Cell Disease.

 Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occuring chemical that relaxes blood vessels and helps improve blood flow.

 The pain associated with vaso-occlusive crisis (pain crisis) in sickle cell disease is caused in part by lack of oxygen and increased tissue acid because blood flow is blocked by stiff sickle red cells.

 Administration of sodium nitrite should generate nitric oxide in this area of hypoxia and acidosis and improve blood flow.

This study will determine if administration of sodium nitrite is safe and can improve small vessel blood flow and tissue oxygenation when given as an additional treatment in patients with acute vaso-occlusive crisis (pain crisis) associated with sickle cell disease.
