(secondQuint)Cinacalcet Hydrochloride in Treating Men With Recurrent Prostate Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To test the hypothesis that once-daily treatment with 30 mg of cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) will reduce the rate of rise of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) compared to pre-treatment PSA values in subjects with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after failed definitive local therapy.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive cinacalcet hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 20 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
