(thirdQuint)Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist for Non Invasive Ventilation and Patient-ventilator Interaction.

 The present study aims to compare various parameters reflecting patient-ventilator synchrony during standard pressure support (PS) and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory assist (NAVA) in a group of patients receiving non invasive ventilation (NIV)for an episode of acute respiratory failure of various origin.

 The subgroup of COPD patients will be analyzed separately.

 The effects of various setting of Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist on patient-ventilator interaction will also be explored.
