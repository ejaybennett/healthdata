(fifthQuint)Observe Change of Endotoxaemia and Related Mediators in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection.

 1.

 Patients Patients with chronic HBV infection and healthy volunteers were enrolled.

 There were asymptomatic carriers group, patients with chronic hepatitis, patients with hepatic cirrhosis, and patients with acute on chronic liver failure.

 2.

 Endotoxin assay Blood samples were obtained under aseptic conditions by peripheral venipuncture and using pyrogen-free syringes, needles, and glassware.

 Plasma samples were heated at 70 for 10 min.

 Plasma concentration was then measured in duplicate using a commercially available Limulus amebocyte lysate assay following the manufacturer's protocol.

 3.

 ELISA ELISA kits were used to assess in duplicate the plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, TNF, sICAM-1 and sCD14.

 Observe Change of Endotoxaemia and Related Mediators in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection@highlight

This study was designed for changes in endotoxaemia, endotoxin-binding factors, sICAM-1 (soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1), and cytokines during progression of chronic HBV infection.

 Patients with chronic HBV infection and healthy control are included.

 A limulus assay was used to measure plasma endotoxin level and ELISAs were used to measure the concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF), sICAM-1, and soluble CD14 (sCD14).
