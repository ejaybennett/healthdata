(thirdQuint)VISIONAIRE Value Study.

 The objective of the current observational study is to assess value of surgical instrumentation following analysis of health economic data.

 It is hypothesized that patient matched cutting block technology VISIONAIRE cent may reduce TKA operative time, blood loss, surgical error and adverse event risk as well as providing improved mechanical alignment.

 In order to test this hypothesis, subjects will be randomized to either VISIONAIRE cent or standard TKA instrumentation groups.

 One site will enroll a total of 38 patients; 19 patients per group.

 All patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in this protocol will be asked to participate in the study.

 If the patient consents to participate, they will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two study arms.

 Patients requiring TKA will be implanted with Legion, Genesis II or Journey BCS (Smith & Nephew) total knee implant systems.

 Standard instrumentation will be used to assist the surgeon in placing the implant in the control group.

 In the VISIONAIRE cent group, standard instrumentation will not be used in the surgery.

 Patients randomized to the VISIONAIRE cent arm will have an MRI preoperatively that will be used to create the customized cutting blocks.

 All patients will have an x-ray at each postoperative interval.

 VISIONAIRE Value Study@highlight

This is a single center randomized observational study that evaluates the cost benefit ratio between the use of two types of instrumentation in TKA: standard instrumentation vs.

 VISIONAIRE cent Patient Matched Technology.

 This study does not involve treatment or investigational products, as all components are FDA approved and are commercially available.
