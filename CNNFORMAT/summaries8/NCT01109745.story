(secondQuint)Effectiveness of the Pelican Instrument in Medical Care.

 Health related quality of life (HRQL) is important to the asthmatic child and if HRQL aspects are taken into account in daily care this could result in improved treatment satisfaction, compliance, asthma control and, ultimately, improved HRQL.

 The Pelican instrument we have developed has the essential features to be useful in daily care.

 In this study, the effectiveness of implementing the Pelican instrument in medical care is assessed.

 An intervention study with 9 months follow-up in primary and secondary care will be carried out.
