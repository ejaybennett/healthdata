(fifthQuint)Hmeenlinna Metabolic Syndrome Research Program: Oxidized LDL and Arterial Elasticity in Metabolic Syndrome and Controls (HMS-01).

 Accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoproteins in the intimae of arteries together with risk factors known to enhance atherosclerosis, damage the endothelium of the arterial wall.

 Dysfunction of the endothelium leads into loss of elasticity of the artery.

 Especially a reduction in the elasticity of small arteries has been found prominent in atherosclerosis and is believed to serve as a marker for early stages of atherosclerosis.

 In this study, we investigate whether the levels of oxidized LDL and arterial elasticity differ between patients with metabolic syndrome and their physically active controls.

 Oxidized LDL is assessed by a two-site ELISA immunoassay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden).

 The capacitive elasticity of large arteries (C1) and the reflective elasticity of small arteries (C2) are automatically assessed by the CR-2000 as a mean of five most similar pulse waves appearing during the measurement.

 C1 identifies the elastic properties of aorta and other large arteries, C2 the endothelial function of the microvascular circulation.

 Proper statistical methods are used to reveal possible differences and their significance between the patients and controls.

 Hmeenlinna Metabolic Syndrome Research Program: Oxidized LDL and Arterial Elasticity in Metabolic Syndrome and Controls (HMS-01)@highlight

Mechanisms that link metabolic syndrome to atherosclerosis are incompletely understood.

 As a part of Hameenlinna Metabolic Syndrome Research Program (HMS), 40 men with metabolic syndrome and their 40 physically active controls (age: 30 to 65 years) are compared in a cross-sectional study.

 Except routine laboratory parameters, arterial elasticity and levels of oxidized LDL are determined.

 Study hypothesis: Levels of oxidized LDL and findings in arterial elasticity may differ between subjects with metabolic syndrome and controls explaining the elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases among patients with metabolic syndrome.
