(fifthQuint)Efficacy Trial of Warrior Check-Up.

 The health and well-being of military personnel, and consequently the capacity for optimal functioning of military units, are compromised by the abuse of alcohol and/or other drugs.

 Rates of heavy drinking are higher among military personnel than in the general population and are even higher among recently deployed personnel.

 While counseling can be effective, most substance abusers do not tend to voluntarily seek treatment.

 Moreover, military personnel encounter more real and perceived barriers to seeking treatment.

 The substance abuse field is increasingly focusing on developing interventions for those at early stages of readiness to change, i.

e.

, those contemplating but not yet committed to change.

 A brief, telephone-delivered motivational enhancement intervention (MET) called a "check-up," has shown promise in promoting self-initiated behavior change as well as voluntary treatment entry, enhanced retention, and more successful outcomes for substance abuse.

 Adapting the "check-up" for application with military personnel is warranted for three key reasons: (1) it has the potential of overcoming barriers to treatment-seeking, i.

e.

, stigma and apprehension of a negative impact on one's military career; (2) it has the potential of attracting voluntary participation; and (3) protocols for disseminating this low cost intervention for use with deployed military can readily be developed and evaluated.

 Efficacy Trial of Warrior Check-Up@highlight

This study will develop and test a brief telephone-delivered motivational enhancement intervention for substance abusing military personnel who are not currently in treatment.

 The hypotheses being tested are that this intervention will prompt a willingness to participate voluntarily in a self-appraisal of substance abuse behavior and consequences, self-initiated change or enrollment in a treatment or self-help program, and cessation of abuse of alcohol or other drugs.
