(thirdQuint)A Community Trial to Determine Whether 'Safe Storage' Reduces Pesticide Self-poisoning in Rural Asia.

 We will set up a large community-based, cluster randomised controlled trial of 162 villages (mean adult population 900) in rural Sri Lanka to determine the effectiveness and cost of the provision of safe storage containers to prevent pesticide poisoning.

 The study will be based in Anuradhapura District where we have carried out public health studies of pesticide poisoning since 2002.

 81 intervention and 81 control villages will be recruited.

 Randomisation will be clustered, with villages rather than households randomised.

 A census will be performed at baseline and after 3 years to establish the population demographics and number of person-years exposed.

 The primary outcome will be the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning; secondary outcomes will be the incidence of all self-poisoning, all self-harm, fatal self-harm, pesticide poisoning and unintentional paediatric pesticide poisoning.

 We will use Poisson regression models, taking account of clustering and stratification, for the analysis.

 The study will provide definitive evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of this approach that will determine whether it should be promoted across Asia.

 A Community Trial to Determine Whether 'Safe Storage' Reduces Pesticide Self-poisoning in Rural Asia@highlight

A major global public health priority is to identify effective methods for preventing deaths from pesticide self-poisoning.

 The aim of this work is to determine whether the provision of lockable storage containers to poor households in rural Asia can reduce the incidence of intentional pesticide self-poisoning.

 Secondary questions include the effect of these containers on unintentional pesticide poisoning in children and overall self-harm.
