(firstQuint)A Pilot Study Using Laser Speckle Imaging of Neonate Cerebral Vasculature.

 This study involves imaging of superficial blood vessels in the infant's head.

 Analysis of reflected light images provides the type of data necessary to see the blood vessels.

 The researcher want to assess only feasibility of our instrument.

 If we determine that our instrument has sufficient spatial resolution to image directly large vessels, then we will proceed with plans for a larger study with statistical power.

The researcher want to know whether reflections of light can be used to provide real-time pictures of blood vessel formation around infants' heads.

 This approach is called laser speckle imaging
