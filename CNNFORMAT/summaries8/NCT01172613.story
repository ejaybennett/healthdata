(secondQuint)Optimal Concentration of Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus (Dp) Allergen Extract for Skin Prick Test (SPT) of Thai Population.

 The current allergy diagnostic reagent of house dust mites marketed in the USA is at 10,000 AU/ml.

 This is based on the IDEAL50 concept put forth by Turkeltaub et al, almost 3 decades ago.

 Such concentration has been shown to give large degree of false positives even in the US population.

 In Thailand, it was anecdotally observed that at such concentration, sizes of positive tests among atopic subjects were quite large and could lead to discomfort and a possible anaphylaxis in certain allergic individuals.

 Moreover, up to 40% of normal individuals could give positive reaction to this concentration.

 It is therefore desirable to reexamine the appropriate concentration of diagnostic reagent of house dust mites among the Thai population and will be the main objective of this research.
