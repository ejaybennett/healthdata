(secondQuint)Administration of IV Laronidase Post Bone Marrow Transplant in Hurler.

 The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of giving weekly Laronidase for 2 years in patients with Hurler syndrome after allogeneic transplantation.

 Specifically, i) the ability to enroll patients, ii) continued compliance throughout the study with drug administration and testing, as well as iii) the relevance of various endpoint determinations will be assessed.

 The findings of the pilot study will be used to assess whether a subsequent larger study will be conducted.

 Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of this study will focus on the toxicity associated with weekly Laronidase in this patient population, and the evaluation of a variety of testing and efficacy parameters that would be utilized to measure outcomes and determine benefit in patients treated on a subsequent larger study.

 Eligible patients will receive Laronidase as an infusion over several hours once a week at a local site.

 The dosing of enzyme will be the standard doses recommended by Genzyme.
