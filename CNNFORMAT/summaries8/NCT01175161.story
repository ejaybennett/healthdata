(fifthQuint)Postpartum Intrauterine Device Study.

 Women will be enrolled into the study during prenatal care.

 After delivery, if they meet secondary eligibility criteria, they will be randomized to receive the IUD immediately postpartum or at the 6-week postpartum visit.

 Women will be followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after IUD insertion, and be assessed at those time points for satisfaction with the method and IUD expulsion.

 Postpartum Intrauterine Device Study@highlight

The purpose of this non-blinded randomized clinical trial is to pilot the design of a randomized clinical trial to be conducted in Malawi to investigate immediate postpartum insertion of the Copper T380 intrauterine contraceptive device (CuT380A-IUCD) compared to placement at the 6-week postpartum visit.

 The investigators hypothesize that it will be feasible to enroll 140 women into this study, and that women will find the 10 minute to 48 hour time frame for IUCD placement acceptable.
