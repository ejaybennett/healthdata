(fifthQuint)Pomalidomide in Gene Expression Profiling (GEP)-Defined High-risk Multiple Myeloma.

 Pomalidomide is a 2nd generation immunomodulatory agent (IMiD(R)) with greater efficacy than lenalidomide and with a similar toxicity spectrum.

 Phase I trials have shown that pomalidomide 1 to 5 mg is well-tolerated1,2.

 TT3 has been remarkably successful in the management of newly diagnosed MM, inducing CR rates of >60% and 4-year estimates of overall and event-free survival of 85% and 75%.

 Of those achieving CR, estimated 4-year CR rate is 85%.

 TT3 maintenance has been with either VTD in 2003-33 or VRD in 2006-66, so that pomalidomide's role in overcoming refractoriness to lenalidomide can be assessed.

 Pharmacogenomic investigations comparing GEP data obtained at baseline and 48hr post-treatment have been performed in case of thalidomide, dexamethasone, lenalidomide, bortezomib and melphalan3.

 Thus, as most patients on TT3 had baseline and 48-hr GEP investigations performed after bortezomib, the opportunity exists to investigate, at the time of relapse, not only a re-challenge with bortezomib with 48hr GEP but also pomalidomide's effect.

 This is a phase II study, open-label, single institution trial of pomalidomide in GEP-defined, high-risk relapsing/refractory multiple myeloma.

 Prior therapy must have included lenalidomide.

 Pomalidomide in Gene Expression Profiling (GEP)-Defined High-risk Multiple Myeloma@highlight

This is a phase II study, open-label, single institution trial of pomalidomide in GEP-defined, high-risk relapsing/refractory multiple myeloma.

 Prior therapy must have included lenalidomide.

 Patient accrual is 30 over a 2 year period.

 Primary objective: - To determine progression-free survival (PFS) after initiation of pomalidomide therapy Secondary objective: - To determine the response rate (CR, n-CR, VGPR) and duration of response after pomalidomide therapy.

 - To determine gene expression profiling (GEP) changes exerted within 48 hours of initiation of daily pomalidomide dosing.

 - To determine gene expression profiling (GEP) changes exerted within 48 hours of initiation 3 concurrent days of exposure to lenalidomide.

 - To determine MRI- and PET-CT-defined CR in studies obtained at baseline and every 6 month examinations.
