(fifthQuint)Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, a HFA-MDI Study for Assessment of Pharmacokinetics.

 E004 is formulated with epinephrine free base as the active ingredient, and hydrofluoroalkane (HFA-134a) as the propellant.

 In order to differentiate the inhaled epinephrine from the fluctuating background of endogenous epinephrine 1, a stable-isotope deuterium (2H) labeled epinephrine (epinephrine-d3) preparation will be used to formulate E004 inhalers, denoted as E004-d3.

 PK of E004 at 125 mcg of epinephrine-d3 per inhalation, will be compared to that of the currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine-CFC MDI as the Reference Control (220 mcg per inhalation).

 This study is a randomized, evaluator-blind, single dose, two-arm, crossover, PK study, to be conducted in ~18 healthy, male and female, adult volunteers.

 PK will be studied using E004-d3 at 125 mcg per inhalation (Arm T).

 A currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine CFC-MDI will be used as a Reference Control (Arm C).

 Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, a HFA-MDI Study for Assessment of Pharmacokinetics@highlight

This study examines the pharmacokinetic profile of Armstrong's proposed Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, an HFA-MDI (E004), using a stable isotope deuterium-labeled epinephrine (epinephrine-d3) to differentiate the administered drug from the endogenous epinephrine, in healthy male and female adult volunteers.

 The current study is designed for a more thorough evaluation of the E004 Pharmacokinetics.

 Safety of E004 will also be evaluated, under augmented dose conditions.
