(fifthQuint)Neuroendocrine Dysfunction in Traumatic Brain Injury: Effects of Testosterone Therapy.

 This study will assess the hormonal status of men on admission to an inpatient TBI rehabilitation program.

 Eighty-eight Individuals with low Testosterone (T) levels will be randomized to receive either physiologic T therapy or placebo.

 Fifty-six Individuals with sufficient levels of T will be followed as a second control group.

 All three groups will undergo serial assessment of neurological function (as measured by the NIH Toolbox) and functional independence (FIM) to correlate with hormone levels.

 Hormone levels will be assessed through analysis of blood samples drawn from all participants at the time of study screening and at two week intervals for a total of 7 blood draws during the 12 week study period.

 Demographics, injury characteristics, concomitant medication usage and adverse events will be documented by medical record review.

 Statistical analysis will be performed to test study hypotheses.

 Findings will be disseminated at professional and consumer conferences and in peer-reviewed journals and consumer-based publications.

 Results will also be made available through the Craig Hospital website and via summary report to the Colorado TBI Trust Fund Research Program.

 If T therapy is found to be effective, findings will be used as preliminary data for a grant proposal for a multi-center trial.

 Neuroendocrine Dysfunction in Traumatic Brain Injury: Effects of Testosterone Therapy@highlight

The purpose of this study is to: Address 3 short term objectives; (1) Determine the effects of physiologic testosterone (T) therapy on neurological function and functional independence following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in hypogonadal men during inpatient rehabilitation; (2) Document the natural history of neuroendocrine dysfunction and recovery in men during inpatient rehabilitation after TBI; (3) Obtain data to validate the NIH toolbox, a novel assessment of neurological function for use in the TBI population; and two long-term objectives: (1) Utilize study findings to design a multicenter trial to further assess the impact of T therapy in hypogonadal men following TBI and (2) Impact TBI practice management with new information about neuroendocrine dysfunction after TBI and hormone treatments to improve outcomes.
