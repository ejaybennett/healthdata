(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of DOTAREM in MRI of Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions.

 This is a study involving the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents called Dotarem(R).

 The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy (how well does it work) of Dotarem(R) when used for taking images of the brain and spine.

 The results of the MRI will be compared to the results of images taken without Dotarem(R).
