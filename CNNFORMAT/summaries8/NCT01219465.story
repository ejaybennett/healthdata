(firstQuint)Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Infusion for Initial Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic cells.

Patients require multiple daily insulin injections throughout their lives as well as close monitoring of their diet and blood sugar levels to prevent complications.

 The investigators hope umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells could not only address the need for -cell replacement but also control of the autoimmune response to cells.
