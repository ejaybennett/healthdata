(thirdQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety Study to Assess Influenza Vaccine Formulated With Haemagglutinin (HA) Antigen From Two Suppliers.

 The objectives of this study are to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity and safety of the parenteral formulation of the 2010/2011-season influenza vaccine, Inflexal V, using HA antigen obtained from 2 different production facilities, and to compare the immunogenicity of both formulations to pre-defined EMA criteria for the annual relicensing of seasonal influenza vaccines.

 The evaluation will be done in young adults and elderly.
