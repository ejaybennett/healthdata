(firstQuint)Effects of Interscalene Brachial Plexus Nerve Blocks on the Hand and Forearm.

 This is a research study to prospectively determine the proportion of cases in which an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block produces hand and forearm anesthesia.

 The investigators will investigate this issue in patients having shoulder and not hand/forearm surgery.

 We will test hand grip strength and sensation to determine if the hand and forearm are responding to the anesthesia.
