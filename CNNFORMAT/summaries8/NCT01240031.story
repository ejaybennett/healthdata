(secondQuint)Effect of Energy- and Protein-rich Foods on Physiological Functions and Quality of Life in Undernourished Patients.

 Undernutrition and insufficent dietary intake in hospitalised patients is a widespread problem.

 It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, worsened physiological function and quality of life and increased expenses for the health care system.

 Food quality has been shown to be positively associated with dietary intake in patients.

 However, there has lacked knowledge on how food quality can be optimised to promote intake.

 A project was therefore initiated, which aimed at establishing a framework for developing appetising, energy- and protein-rich foods for patients at nutritional risk.

 This project included qualitative and quantitative investigation of nutritional risk patients' meal experiences and preferences (se citations below).

 These results have served as a basis for optimsing energy- and protein-rich foods as part of an indivudalised nutritional therapy aimed at improving dietary intake in nutritional risk patients.

 Effect of Energy- and Protein-rich Foods on Physiological Functions and Quality of Life in Undernourished Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether individualised nutritional therapy comprised of appetising, energy- and protein-rich foods can have a positive effect on physiological function and quality of life of undernourished patients as compared to usual nutrition care.
