(firstQuint)Treatment of Vitiligo With Low-energy Visible Light Laser.

 Vitiligo is a pigmentary disorder characterized by depigmented and hypopigmented macules and patches.

 There are forms of vitiligo which are more resistant to treatment, including segmental vitiligo and acral vitiligo.

 Previous studies have shown that a low energy helium-neon (633 nm) laser can cause increased proliferation of melanocytes and repigmentation in segmental-type vitiligo.

 The goal of this study is to verify these results and show efficacy in other recalcitrant forms of vitiligo including acral vitiligo and post melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation vitiligo.
