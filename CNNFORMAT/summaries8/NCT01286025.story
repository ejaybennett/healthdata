(firstQuint)Comparing the Effect of Video-cases and Text-cases on Medical Students' Learning in Tutorial.

 Tutorials at Harvard Medical School use problem-based learning with written cases.

 Students work in groups under the supervision of a tutor who guides their exploration of the material.

 As students progress through the curriculum there is an opportunity to advance the complexity of the material they are presented with.

 Video-based patient case studies have been shown to improve critical thinking ratios in paediatric medical student problem-based learning exercises, and time spent on data exploration, theory building and theory evaluation in postgraduate residency programs.

 We hypothesize that video provides a stimulus that improves cognitive processing and critical thinking among medical students, as compared to working from the text-based transcript of the same case.
