(secondQuint)Observation of Recovery of Foveal Cone Microstructures After Macular Hole Surgery.

 Macular hole patients were evaluated by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to determine the integrity of the microstructures of the foveal photoreceptors.

 The inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, the external limiting membrane (ELM), and the cone outer segment tips (COST) line were determined preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the MH surgery.

 The correlation between the integrity of the foveal photoreceptor microstructures and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was determined.

The objective is to determine whether a recovery of the microstructures of the foveal photoreceptors after macular hole (MH) closure is correlated with the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is determined.
