(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Cryoablation for Metastatic Lung Tumors.

 ECLIPSE is a treatment, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with patients serving as their own control.

 This study is to enroll patients who will undergo cryoablation of at least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor that is less than or equal to 3.

5 cm.

 Patients will be followed to 5 years post their cryoablation procedure.

 Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold temperatures.

 Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney).
