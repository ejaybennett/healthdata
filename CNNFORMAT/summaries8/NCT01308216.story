(secondQuint)Transcranial Laser Therapy in the Rehabilitation of Hemiplegic Patients From Ischemic Stroke.

 Transcranial laser therapy is applied with an InGa(Al)As diode laser.

The laser in automatic scanning is applied over both cerebral hemisphere during 15 sessions.

 Patients simultaneously performed a program of therapeutic exercises 3 days a week.

 Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale, which assessed upper limb motor function, and the Barthel index, which assessed general functional disability.
