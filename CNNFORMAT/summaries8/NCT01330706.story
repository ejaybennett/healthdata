(firstQuint)Efficacy of Intraoperative Surgical Scrubbing in Reducing Bacterial Load After Nail Removal Surgery.

 The investigators conducted a controlled, prospective randomized study to examine the antiseptic efficacy of intraoperative scrubbing methods during nail avulsion surgery.

 The investigators compared intraoperative antiseptic scrubbing using 0.

9% saline solution and 0.

1% polihexanide.

 Swab samples were taken from each patient at 5 distinct stages throughout the surgical procedure, and bacterial culture analysis was performed (positive culture rate, total inocula count, reduction of bacterial load, and identification of specific microorganisms).
