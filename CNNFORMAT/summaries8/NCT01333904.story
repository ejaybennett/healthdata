(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamic Effect Study of PUR118.

 The proposed initial trial in healthy subjects and subjects with mild COPD will establish the tolerability of PUR118 in these subjects over single and short multi-day dosing periods.

 The study will also provide preliminary data regarding PUR118's potential impact on biomarkers in COPD.

 Finally, this trial will assess PUR118's effect on mucociliary clearance.

 This is a four part study enrolling healthy volunteers in a single ascending dose design (SAD; Part I), followed by multiple ascending dose design (MAD; Part II).

 Contingent on demonstration of safety in a healthy subject population, the study will enroll mild COPD subjects for a short multi-dose design (Part III) incorporating safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints.

 Lastly Part IV of the trial will assess the effect of PUR118 on mucociliary clearance in mild COPD subjects.

 Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamic Effect Study of PUR118@highlight

The purpose of this study is to establish single and multiple dose safety in healthy subjects and subjects with mild chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD).

 In addition, the study will evaluate preliminary proof of concept endpoints in COPD subjects such as biomarkers in sputum and mucociliary clearance.
