(fifthQuint)Evaluation of a 4mmx32G Pen Needle for Injection of Basal Insulin Doses Above 40 Units.

 This is an open-label, randomized two period crossover study.

 Each subject's participation is expected to last about seven weeks and includes a brief enrolment period followed by two consecutive three week treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2).

 In Period 1, subjects will use the first assigned study pen needle (either the 4mm Nano or the 8mm Short) to self-administer daily all their pen-based diabetes medications.

 Upon completion of Period 1, subjects will switch to the alternate pen needle for Period 2.

 The randomization schedule will determine the order of pen needle use.

 Blood samples for determination of fasting blood glucose and serum fructosamine concentrations will be collected at baseline (Visit 2) and the end of Period 1 (Visit 3) and Period 2 (Visit 4).

 Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.

 Evaluation of a 4mmx32G Pen Needle for Injection of Basal Insulin Doses Above 40 Units@highlight

The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the BD 4mm x 32G Ultra-Fine Nano pen needle provides equivalent glycemic control to the BD 8mm x 31G Ultra-Fine short pen needle as measured by fructosamine (FRU) among Lantus(R), Levemir(R), and/or NPH users taking one or more single daily injections of greater than 40 units of insulin.

 Glycemic control, injection pain, leakage, preference, comfort, and other parameters will be compared between the 4mm x 32G and the 8 mm x 31 G pen needle after three weeks of use of each device.

 Sufficient numbers of subjects taking Lantus(R) as their basal insulin will be enrolled so as to allow for pre-specified analysis of this subgroup.
