(thirdQuint)Treatment Strategy for Alcohol Use Disorders in Veterans With TBI.

 Veterans are vulnerable to develop complex forms of addictive disorders characterized by the presence of traumatic brain injury and psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and mood disturbances.

 Alcohol use disorders are frequently observed among veterans and exert a detrimental effect on community reintegration after deployment.

 Attending to this veteran health problem, the VA is devoting extraordinary efforts to develop adequate treatment strategies.

 In this study we will evaluate treatment outcomes and identify specific factors that influence alcohol use disorders treatment response in a VA Intensive Outpatient Program offering rehabilitation treatment to the growing number of veterans with alcohol use disorders.

 Cooperation between researchers and clinical staff will allow optimizing treatment strategies that enhance the recovery of veterans with alcohol use disorders.

 Treatment Strategy for Alcohol Use Disorders in Veterans With TBI@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to understand the effectiveness of valproate (a common mood stabilizer) to further reduce alcohol misuse when given in addition to attending an alcohol rehabilitation program as well as the treatment of mood disorders or PTSD.

 The main goal of this project is to understand if people receiving valproate will have a better recovery than people receiving the standard treatment for alcohol dependence: naltrexone.
