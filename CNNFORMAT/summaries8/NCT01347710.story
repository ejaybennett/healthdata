(thirdQuint)A Phase 3 Multi-center Study to Assess PET Imaging of Flurpiridaz F 18 Injection in Patients With CAD.

.

 The study will assess the diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of Flurpiridaz F18 Injection MPI against SPECT MPI in patients screened for CAD as determined by ICA.

 Six hundred and eighty evaluable patients will be enrolled and will undergo SPECT MPI and Flurpiridaz F18 PET MPI.

 Patients will be considered for enrollment if they are scheduled to undergo or have undergone prior ICA without intervention (being either positive or negative for CAD).

@highlight

The primary objective of the study is to assess the diagnostic efficacy (specificity and sensitivity) of flurpiridaz F18 injection PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) compared to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI in the detection of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) as defined by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or a documented history of Myocardial Infarction (MI).
