(firstQuint)Effect of 10mg Domperidone on Gastric Emptying of a High-fat Meal and Appetite Sensations in Healthy Adults.

 This study aims to investigate the effect of domperidone on gastric emptying and appetite sensations in healthy subjects.

 Domperidone is a dopamine 2 (D2) receptor antagonist with claims of gastrointestinal tract pro-kinetic activity.

 Accelerated gastric emptying (GE) may lead to reduced satiation, increased food intake and is associated with obesity and diabetes mellitus.

 It is hypothesized that domperidone will increase gastric emptying rate and reduce satiety responses to a high-fat meal.

 The effect of acute oral administration of 10 mg domperidone on gastric emptying of a high-fat pancake test meal, and subjective appetite sensations by visual analogue scale will be measured for six hours postprandially in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded manner in 13 healthy subjects.
