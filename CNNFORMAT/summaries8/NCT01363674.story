(thirdQuint)To Assess the Level of Adherence of Subjects Receiving SAIZEN Via Easypod in Greece.

 Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter, longitudinal observational registry.

 Parents/subjects will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for populationbased analyses and optionally to adhere to a patient adherence support program designed to improve their adherence and, ultimately, clinical outcomes.

 Adherence data will be primarily derived from the Easypod cent device combined with physician data entry of outcome measures.

 Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively.

 This will allow the establishment of adherence profiles and explore the hypothesis that patient adherence support programs improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes.

 Collected data will be also analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies.
