(firstQuint)Gut Hormones After Oral Versus Intravenous Amino Acids.

 Amino acid mixture is given orally or intravenously to match total concentrations of amino acids in healthy subjects.

 Samples are taken regularly for 300 min after administrations.

 Plasma levels of the gut hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)and determined and related to plasma levels of insulin and glucagon.
