(thirdQuint)Cardiac MR (CMR) in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Non-responders.

 CMR will be performed in patients under CRT who are currently not responding to CRT.

 Different LV-RV delays will be programmed during CMR and LV function and different dyssynchrony parameters will be assessed.

 Results will be used to determine the optimal LV-RV delay, and CRT-devices will be reprogrammed accordingly.

 Improvement in NYHA-class/conversion to therapy responder will be determined clinically after 3 months.

 Cardiac MR (CMR) in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Non-responders@highlight

Cardiac MR (CMR) will be used to assess myocardial activation and hemodynamics in patients with CRT.

 Goals are to demonstrate that - differences in Left ventricle (LV)- right ventricle (RV) pacing delays cause differences in myocardial activation - differences in LV-RV pacing delays cause differences in LV/RV hemodynamics and to use these data to optimize CRT.
