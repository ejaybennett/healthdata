(firstQuint)Study of Obese Subjects Previously Implanted With the EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner.

 Patients with obesity are at significantly greater risk of developing significant co-morbid complications, and are associated with an increased risk in all-cause mortality.

 The GI Endobarrier Liner represents a viable alternative to other short-term weight loss methods.

 It is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, which may allow patients to recover faster with less morbidity and mortality.

 This study is investigating whether the the GI Endobarrier Liner can be reimplanted.
