(thirdQuint)Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: Etiology, Course and Prognosis.

 Patients with central serous chorioretinopathy are recruited from the Department of Ophthalmology at the Medical University of Vienna.

 All patients undergo ETDRS visual acuity measurement, Pelli-Robson contrast examination, Amsler-Grid testing, questionnaire testing, ophthalmologic examination, SD-OCT and polarization-sensitive OCT, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus photo and microperimetry.

 Patients are re-examined after an interval of 6 weeks until subretinal fluid is entirely reabsorbed to gain further insides in etiology, course and prognosis of this disease.

 During this study patients with an acute episode of central serous chorioretinopathy are observed with established ophthalmologic methods (multimodal imagine) every 6 weeks until subretinal fluid is reabsorbed to gain further insides in etiology, course and prognosis of this disease.
