(fifthQuint)A Study of AUY922 for GIST(Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) Patients.

 This is an open-label; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phase II study of AUY922 in patients with advanced GIST failed to or intolerance of imatinib and sunitinib therapy.

 AUY922 is a novel HSP90 inhibitor and will be administered at dose of 70 mg/m2 i.

v.

 infusion on D1 every week.

 The Simon one sample two-stage minimax design was used with 15 suitable patients to be accrued to the first stage.

 If at least two patients meet our primary endpoint (complete response+partial response+stable disease4 months), an additional 10 patients would be recruited to the second stage.

 AUY922 would be considered active in this patient population, if there were more than 5 cases of non-progressive disease in the total cohort of 25 patients.

A Phase II Study of AUY922, Novel HSP Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced GIST Failed to or Intolerance of Imatinib and Sunitinib Therapy Primary endpoint: cent The primary endpoint of this study is to assess disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease4 months) of AUY922 in patients with advanced GIST failed to imatinib and sunitinib Secondary endpoints: - To determinate the objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial response) - To determinate the time to tumor progression (TTP) - To evaluate the safety and toxicity profiles of AUY922 - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of AUY922 in Taiwan GIST population - To access the pharmacodynamic effect of AUY922 on HSP client proteins in blood and tumor if feasible , i.
