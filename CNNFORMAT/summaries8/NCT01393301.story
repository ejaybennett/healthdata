(fifthQuint)Integrated Treatment for Smoking Cessation & Anxiety in People With HIV.

 This study represents an important step in treating nicotine dependence in HIV-positive individuals.

 This study addresses an important public health issue by assessing an intervention that may lead to a more effective application for the treatment of at-risk HIV+ smokers.

 The 1-year formative phase of the study will develop an integrated treatment for quitting smoking for anxiety-vulnerable HIV+ smokers.

 The proposed treatment will include cognitive-behavioral talk therapy for quitting smoking, a nicotine patch, and cognitive-behavioral talk therapy for anxiety.

 The pilot of the proposed treatment will be conducted with a small group of individuals (N = up to 12).

 This phase will be used to establish feasibility of treatment delivery, and participant acceptability before conducting a pilot randomized trial of the treatment.

 Additionally, this phase will monitor smoking cessation history through Point Prevalence Abstinence (PPA), as well as anxiety symptoms through the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) at the baseline and follow-up assessments.

 This study represents an important step in treating nicotine dependence in HIV-positive individuals.

 This study addresses an important public health issue by assessing an intervention that may lead to a more effective application for the treatment of at-risk HIV+ smokers.

 The pilot RCT phase of the study (years 2 and 3), will test the developed cognitive-behavioral intervention in a pilot randomized-controlled trial format.

 The outcomes for this trial will be to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and the potential for an effect on increasing point prevalence abstinence and deceasing psychological distress.

 Integrated Treatment for Smoking Cessation & Anxiety in People With HIV@highlight

During the 1-year formative phase of a study to develop an integrated treatment for quitting smoking for anxiety-vulnerable HIV+ smokers.

 During this first phase of the study, start-up activities will include piloting the integrated treatment on a small group of individuals (N = up to 12), obtaining expert consultant and participant feedback, and development of the final treatment manual and procedures.

 The goal during this phase will be to establish feasibility of treatment delivery, participant acceptability, and potential for a treatment effect before conducting a pilot randomized trial of the treatment.

 During the two-year pilot RCT phase of the above study, we directly develop and test a novel psychosocial/behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention for HIV+ smokers with interfering psychological distress.
