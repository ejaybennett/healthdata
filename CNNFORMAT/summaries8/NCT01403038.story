(secondQuint)An Open-label Study of the Effects of Elagolix in Adult Premenopausal Females.

 This is an open-label, multiple-dose, Phase 1 study in premenopausal subjects aged 18 years to 40 years, with a history of regular menstrual cycles (24 to 32 days long) and no evidence of significant gynecological disorders.

 The objective of the study is to determine the effects of different dosing regimens of elagolix on ovulation, ovarian activity, and ovarian reserve.

 The study consists of 3 periods: a Screening Period of up to 50 days prior to the first dose, a Treatment Period of 3 months duration (Cycles 1-3), and a Follow-up Period of up to 60 days.

 During the Screening and Treatment menstrual cycles, serial transvaginal ultrasounds and determination of serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin B will be performed three times weekly.

 Subjects will maintain a daily diary of uterine bleeding.

 Pregnancy testing will be performed frequently throughout the study.

 Subjects will be required to use nonhormonal dual contraception consistently during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.
