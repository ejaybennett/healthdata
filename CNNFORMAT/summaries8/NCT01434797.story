(secondQuint)Value of PET/CT Imaging in the Diagnosis of Permanent Central Venous Catheters Infection.

 Permanent central venous catheters are frequently infected and therefore need surgical removal.

 When a clear diagnostic for infection cannot be defined, catheter removal might be at risk for the patient, for the therapeutic follow-up and in terms of costs.

 PET/CT and microcalorimetry might help giving conclusive diagnostic of catheter infection.

The study hypothesis is that F-18-FDG PET/CT and microcalorimetry might have a diagnostic value in the detection of permanent central venous catheters (PCVC) infection when conventional means of PCVC infection detection are non-conclusive.
