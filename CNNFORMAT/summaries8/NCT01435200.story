(firstQuint)Intravenous Iron in Gynecologic Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.

 Anemia is a common condition during chemotherapy administration.

 Treatment options usually include oral iron supplementation and blood transfusion.

 However, oral iron has gastrointestinal side effects, which affects patient compliance, and only a small amount of oral iron can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

 Intravenous iron may overcome a block of iron absorption and iron recycling induced by hepcidin.

 Therefore, it may increase hemoglobin level and reduced blood transfusion in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
