(firstQuint)Study of Purified Umbilical Cord Blood CD34+ Stem Cell on Chronic Ischemic Stroke.

 The study will use CD34+ cells (a special kind of cell that is believed to be a stem cell) isolated from UCB (blood obtained at birth from the umbilical cord blood of babies).

 StemCyte, a leading accredited UCB banking company with branches in the United States and Taiwan, will provide the units of UCB that match at least 5 out of 6 HLA (human leukocyte antigens) for transplantation.

 The HLA-matching is the same as that used to match cells and organs for transplantation so that the body does not reject the cells.

 We will isolate CD34 cells from these units, purified them, suspend the cells in solution (1 ml containing 2-8 million cells), and inject the cells into brain around the site damaged by the stroke.

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and possible effectiveness of brain transplants of CD34+ stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) to treat stroke.
