(secondQuint)Comparison Between Classic Leg-press Training and Complex Leg-press Training on a Dynamic Leg-press.

 The project evaluates two different resistance training programs on a leg press.

 One group will perform a standard resistance training with the aim of muscle hypertrophia, the other group will perform a complex resistance training combining rate of force development training, power training, speed endurance as well as sensorimotor aspects (i.

e.

 following visual feedback to reproduce given forces or joint angles).

 Hypotheses: Participants in the complex training group will change the relation between counter movement jump and squat jump, i.

e.

 they will more improve in the counter movement jump because of improved sensorimotor capacity.

 Comparison Between Classic Leg-press Training and Complex Leg-press Training on a Dynamic Leg-press@highlight

A complex training on a dynamic leg-press with visual feed-back will improve coordinative capacity, power, sensorimotor and cognitive aspects more than a classic training on the same leg-press but without visual feed-back.
