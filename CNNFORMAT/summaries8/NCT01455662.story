(firstQuint)Relationship Between Tissue Markes in Patients With Post Cardio Respiratory Syndrome.

 Evaluation of the serum carbon dioxide gradient (GapCO2), central venous saturation (ScvO2) and the clearance of serum lactate (Clac) in predicting hospital mortality after cardiac arrest syndrome (post-PCR).

 Prospective study, unicenter - Intensive Care Unit - HNSC.

 Period: May/2010 to June/2011.

 Serial assessment of GapCO2 of ScvO2 Clac and the first 72 hours post-PCR.

 Excluded under 18, survival of less than 6HS, pregnant women, traumatized, post-operative hypothermia and liver disease.

 T-student test, 95% (p <0.

05).

 Relationship Between Tissue Markes in Patients With Post Cardio Respiratory Syndrome@highlight

There is a correlation between hospital mortality and changes in markers of tissue perfusion, lactate, and venous oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide gradient.
