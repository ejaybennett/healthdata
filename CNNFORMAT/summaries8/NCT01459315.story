(secondQuint)GSK1349572 Exposure in Blood, Seminal Fluid, and Rectal Fluid and Tissue in Healthy Male Subjects.

 The purpose of this study is to determine first dose and steady-state concentrations of GSK1349572 in seminal fluid, rectal mucosal fluid, and rectal tissue compared to blood plasma (BP) in HIV-1 negative males.

 GSK1349572 is an investigational next generation integrase inhibitor currently in Phase III trials.

 Understanding the concentrations of GSK1349572 in multiple male biological compartments will inform its role in preventing HIV infection by making an HIV-infected person less likely to transmit the virus, and protecting uninfected persons from acquiring the virus.
