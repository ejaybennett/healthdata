(firstQuint)ProMRI AFFIRM Study of the EVIA/ENTOVIS Pacemaker With Safio S Pacemaker Leads.

 In the past, MR scans were always contraindicated for pacemaker patients.

 If particular prerequisites and conditions are fulfilled, MR scans can now be conducted on patients with BIOTRONIK's EVIA/ENTOVIS pacemakers in combination with the Safio S pacemaker leads, scheduled to be part of this clinical study.

 The specific MRI conditions for this investigation with the EVIA/ENTOVIS pacemaker family and Safio S pacemaker leads are defined in the study protocol.
