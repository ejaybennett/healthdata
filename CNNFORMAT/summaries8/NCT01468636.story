(thirdQuint)A RTC to Examine the Effectiveness of 400 mg of Oral Zinc Gluconate as Adjunctive Therapy for Ano-genital Warts.

 Clients presenting to the BCCDC STI clinic with genital warts will be randomized to either 400 mg zinc gluconate or placebo (200mg BID) for 8 weeks in addition to the standard of care.

 Clinical assessment of warts and additional standard treatment will occur every 7-10 days for a maximum of 8 weeks.

 A telephone call will occur at week 20 to determine if any of the warts have cleared or re-appeared.

 The appearance of new warts will also be noted.

 The proportion of subjects who have complete clearance of genital warts at 8 weeks will be compared between groups.

 A RTC to Examine the Effectiveness of 400 mg of Oral Zinc Gluconate as Adjunctive Therapy for Ano-genital Warts@highlight

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of 400 mg of oral zinc gluconate on genital warts.

 Our hypothesis is that there will be a 10% difference in complete clearance of genital warts in the group randomized to oral plus standard of care compared to those randomized to placebo plus standard of care.
