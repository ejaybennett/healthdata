(firstQuint)Comparison of Cilotax Stent and Everolimus -Eluting Stent With Diabetes Mellitus (ESSENCE-DM III).

 Prospective, randomized multi-center trial of 300 patients will be enrolled at 7 centers in Korea.

 Following angiography, diabetic patients with significant diameter stenosis >50% by visual estimation have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and eligible for stenting without any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) Cilotax stent vs.

 b) Xience Prime stent.

 All patients will be followed for at least 1 year.

 Angiographic follow-up at 9-months is routinely recommended.
