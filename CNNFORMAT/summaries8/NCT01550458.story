(secondQuint)Safety Study of Mibefradil When Given Four Times a Day in Healthy Volunteers.

 This study will establish the safety, detailed pharmacokinetics, and, possibly, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ascending doses of mibefradil administered four times a day (QID) in healthy volunteers.

 The knowledge gained will then guide the details of a study of Interlaced Therapy cent in patients with recurrent High Grade Glioma (HGG).

 Non-clinical studies are currently on-going in the efficacy of Interlaced Therapy cent in ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and intracranial malignancy.
