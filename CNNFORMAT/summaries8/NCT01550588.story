(fifthQuint)Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke Patients With High-Risk Patent Foramen Ovale (DEFENSE-PFO).

 Selection of patients: Among cryptogenic stroke patients, patients who was identified as high risk PFO which might be defined as high-risk of recurrence (PFO size 2 mm or atrial septal aneurysm or hypermobility by TEE) will be randomized 1:1 to :a) Device closure using Amplatzer device vs.

 b) standard medical therapy alone.

 All patients will be followed for at least 2 years.

 Echocardiography Findings for high-risk PFO Digitally, stored transesophageal echocardiographic images were reviewed and analyzed by an investigator.

 Using calipers, the PFO size was measured as the maximum separation of the septum primum from the septum secundum.

 ASA or hypermobility was defined as 10 mm of phasic septal excursion either into the atrium or a sum total excursion of 15 mm during the cardiorespiratory cycle, with a base of 15 mm.

 Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke Patients With High-Risk Patent Foramen Ovale (DEFENSE-PFO)@highlight

Background and hypothesis: The appropriate treatment strategy for secondary stroke prevention in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains challenging.

 Clinical and anatomical variables reported to be risk factors associated with stroke recurrence include older age, large PFO, large right-to-left shunting, and combined atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), which, however, were not confirmed by other studies.

 The investigators hypothesized that percutaneous closure of PFO could be an effective option for secondary prevention in cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO.

 Trial Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess whether percutaneous device closure of PFO is superior to conventional antithrombotic treatment in preventing stroke recurrence in the cryptogenic stroke patients with high-risk PFO.
