(secondQuint)Peri-operative Prediction of Prolonged Stay in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for Adult Cardiac Surgery.

 Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly associated with a systemic inflammatory response that exacerbates peri-operative life-threatening complications and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.

 These features can prolong the stay in the CICU.

 Many peri-operative clinical risk factors contribute to those adverse outcomes resulting in prolonged CICU stay.

 If the investigators can create a model to identify the effects of these intra-operative clinical risk factors to prolonged CICU stay.

The purpose of this study is to create a model using intra-operative modified SOFA score and peri-operative clinical factors to predict prolonged stay in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for adult cardiac surgery with heart-lung machine
