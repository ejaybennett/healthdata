(secondQuint)Evaluation of Educational Intervention to Teach Principles of Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) in Biology Classes.

 Shared decision making is increasingly demanded by patients in order to take part in health care decisions.

 However this demand for autonomy can only be used for shared decision making if the patient has basic skills in critical health literacy.

 To transfer health care literacy to young and healthy consumers educational intervention programs at high-school might be a feasible and effective way.

 This preliminary phase 2 study is designed to investigate the effect of an educational intervention to be integrated in a curriculum for upcoming teachers in biology.
