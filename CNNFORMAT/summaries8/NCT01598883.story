(fifthQuint)Understanding "Heparin Resistance" in Cardiac Surgery.

 This study uses a prospective, randomized, open-label cross-over design to evaluate the responses to recombinant human AT (rhAT) and/or supplemental heparin for restoration of heparin-responsiveness in the presence of biomarkers of acute inflammation, so called acute phase reactants.

 Our ultimate goal is, of course, to apply this knowledge to optimize perioperative management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

 We will first identify enrolled patients with altered heparin responsiveness (AHR) as defined by an ACT 450 sec will not enter the randomization phase of the study, their participation in the study will be complete and their routine clinical care will continue unaltered.

 Those with AHR (post-heparin ACT 450 after 350 U/kg); as noted, subjects in this study that achieve the target ACT will be managed according to routine clinical practice without further testing or intervention.

 Under routine care, patients with an inadequate initial response to heparin receive either supplemental heparin (150 U/kg) or pooled human antithrombin (1000 Units), or both.

 In this study, subjects with inadequate heparin response (ACT 450 sec.

 In all enrolled subjects we will measure the levels of three acute phase reactants, Factor VIII, fibrinogen and CRP, heparin levels (anti Xa), AT level (immunofixation) and AT activity after the initial heparin dose.

 For all subjects who do not achieve and ACT of > 450 we will also measure additional heparin levels (anti Xa), AT level (immunofixation), and AT activity after each intervention in the randomization/crossover phase.

 The total amount of blood taken for the research-specific laboratory test is less than 20 ml.

 Understanding "Heparin Resistance" in Cardiac Surgery@highlight

This study will explore altered heparin responsiveness (AHR) in cardiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) requiring systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

 The investigators will evaluate the hypothesis that AHR may be directly related to, modulated or mediated by interactions between heparin, antithrombin (AT), the heparin-AT complex, and one or more acute phase proteins.

 The investigators are particularly interested in identifying patients with "true heparin resistance", that is, patients who demonstrate AHR even after antithrombin-replenishment in the presence of an adequate systemic dose of heparin.
