(fifthQuint)Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the overall response rate of weekly nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations following front-line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the safety profile of weekly nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations following front-line therapy with an EGFR TKI.

 II.

 To evaluate the time-to-progression and overall survival.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

 Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer@highlight

This research study examines the use of Abraxane (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with lung cancer.

 Abraxane is a chemotherapy approved to treat patients with breast cancer.

 Doctors want to know if Abraxane is safe and effective in treating patients with lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.
