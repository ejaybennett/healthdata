(secondQuint)Efficacy and Safety of BEZ235 Compared to Everolimus in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.

 Patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic), low to intermediate grade (histologically confirmed well and moderately differentiated) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) were randomized to either BEZ235 or everolimus.

 The study was planned to include 140 patients, with 70 patients in the BEZ235 treatment group and 70 patients in the everolimus treatment group.

 An interim analysis was conducted on 62 randomized patients.

 The study was terminated as the BEZ235 treatment did not demonstrate a progression free survival advantage to everolimus treatment.
