(secondQuint)Performance-based Reinforcement to Enhance Cognitive Remediation Therapy.

 Forty individuals seeking treatment for an alcohol or cocaine use disorder at the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit (SATU) will be randomized to receive cognitive remediation therapy with or without additional compensation based on performance.

 Participants will use the computerized cognitive remediation program (PSSCogRehab 2012) three times per week for four weeks.

 The primary outcome measure will be an improved performance on the computerized tasks, with secondary outcomes of changes in cognitive functioning (e.

g.

, attention, concentration, memory) as measured by neuropsychological tests between baseline and post-treatment.
