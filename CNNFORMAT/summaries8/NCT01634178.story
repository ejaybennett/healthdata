(firstQuint)Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Healthy Subjects.

 This is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study.

 Each subject will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30 mg apremilast during each of the 2 periods; once under fasting conditions and once after a high fat meal.

 The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive apremilast either fasted first, then fed, or fed first then fasted.

 The subjects will check into the study center on Day -1 of each period, will be dosed on Day 1, and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled pharmacokinetic blood draws and safety evaluations.

 After a washout of at least 5 days to a maximum of 10 days, the subjects return for period 2 during which they will receive apremilast according to their assigned sequence.
