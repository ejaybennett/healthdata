(secondQuint)Slide Interpretation or Standard Surgical Pathology in Assessing Margin Status in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Surgery.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To compare margin status on final pathology with margin status from cytopathologic evaluation.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo cytopathologic sample collection during pancreatic resection during which slides are gently pressed against the cut edge of the pancreas, the surgical bed, and along the superior mesenteric artery, and finally against the tumor itself.
