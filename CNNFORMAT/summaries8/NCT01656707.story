(firstQuint)Adaptive Treatment for Adolescent Cannabis Use Disorders.

 The study will address the current contrasts in youth response to treatment, the problem of poor response to treatment and the prevention of relapse.

 Results from the study may support Adaptive Treatment as an efficacious approach for youth with Cannabis Use Disorder who are poor responders to treatment.

 Poor responders fall into two categories, those who failed to achieve a negative drug urinalysis during the last session of the initial MET/CBT-7 treatment they attended, and those who either dropped out or were administratively discharged at any time during the initial MET/CBT-7 treatment.
