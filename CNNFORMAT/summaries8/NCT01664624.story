(firstQuint)Roflumilast Plus Alogliptin Proof-of-Mechanism Study in Type2 Diabetes.

 This is a study to evaluate the antiglycemic efficacy and safety of roflumilast + alogliptin compared to alogliptin alone and roflumilast alone; it will also include an open-label exenatide treatment arm as a control.

 The antiglycemic efficacy of the combination will be evaluated through the measurement of postprandial active GLP-1 level, ss cell secretion activity (via the measurement of C-peptide and insulin levels), appetite sensations (as assessed by VAS) and glycemic control as assessed by a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS).
