(thirdQuint)A Phase 2 Study With MIP-1404 in Men With High-Risk PC Scheduled for RP and EPLND Compared to Histopathology.

 This is a single arm, open label study of approximately 100 high-risk prostate cancer patients scheduled for prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection.

 Patients receive a single IV dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours after injection.

 As standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) within three weeks of study drug dosing.

 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.

 A Phase 2 Study With MIP-1404 in Men With High-Risk PC Scheduled for RP and EPLND Compared to Histopathology@highlight

This was a multicenter, multi-reader, open-label, Phase 2 study assessing the safety and performance characteristics of MIP 1404 imaging in the detection of prostate gland and pelvic lymph node cancer.

 Comparative performance characteristics between MIP 1404 imaging and MRI were also assessed, as judged by histopathology results.
