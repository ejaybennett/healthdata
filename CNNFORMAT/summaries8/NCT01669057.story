(thirdQuint)Study on Clinical Prognosis, Risk Factors and Genetic Basis of Congenital Heart Disease.

 Congenital heart defect (CHD) is one of birth defects in the structure of the heart and/or great vessels.

 Many types of heart defects exist, most of which either obstruct blood flow in the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal pattern.

 Heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect-related infant deaths.

 So far people recognize that the causes of CHD are the conjunct effect of environment and genetic factors, both of which remain unclear.

 The current stud aims at investigating all the possible perinatal parental environmental risk factors and underlying genetic factors to CHD, including DNA variation and methylations.

 A hospital-based 1:1 matched case control study is conducted.

 Subjects were recruited through neonatal screening program, which includes a clinical symptom screening followed by a cardiac ultrasound diagnosis for those with at least one clinical indicator.

 The blood sample of participant will be collected and the parents of subjects will be interviewed to completed a questionnaire including general information and possible risk factors to CHD.

 Study on Clinical Prognosis, Risk Factors and Genetic Basis of Congenital Heart Disease@highlight

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of parental peri-natal environmental risk factors and genetic factors on the development of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).

 Our hypothesis is that the distributions of some environmental and genetic risk factors significantly differ between neonates with and without CHD.
