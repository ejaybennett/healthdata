(secondQuint)A Comparison of a Sheathed to a Standard Speculum for Visualization of the Cervix.

 This is a randomized trial where physician investigators will perform clinically indicated vaginal speculum examinations using either a sheathed or a standard plastic speculum, to determine which speculum provides the best visualization of the cervix.

 As a secondary outcome, study participants will record their pain level on a 10-cm visual analogue scale.

 A Comparison of a Sheathed to a Standard Speculum for Visualization of the Cervix@highlight

The purpose of this study is to estimate if a novel sheathed speculum provides improved visualization of the cervix compared to a standard ("non sheathed") speculum, and to estimate if the sheathed speculum causes less discomfort during the examination.
