(fifthQuint)Prucalopride in Paediatric Subjects, With Functional Faecal Retention.

 This is a multicentre, open-label trial in which paediatric subjects (ages 4 to 12 years) with FFR were administered prucalopride in oral solution once daily for 8 weeks.

 Subjects who entered this extension trial had completed PRU-USA-12, a single-dose pharmacokinetic trial, usually within the previous week.

 Evaluations for efficacy, safety and tolerability were performed, and plasma samples for analysis of prucalopride levels were obtained at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.

 The initial dosage of prucalopride oral solution was 0.

02 mg/kg/day.

 Dependent on the subject's response, the parent could adjust the dosage within a range of 0.

01 mg/kg/day to 0.

03 mg/kg/day.

 Prucalopride in Paediatric Subjects, With Functional Faecal Retention@highlight

The purpose of this study is characterize the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and steady-state plasma levels after once-daily oral dosing of prucalopride (R108512) as a solution, 0.

01 mg/kg to 0.

03 mg/kg, given to paediatric subjects with functional faecal retention (FFR) for 8 weeks.

 Hypothesis: Pharmacokinetic profile of prucalopride in paediatric subjects is expected to resemble the adult pharmacokinetic profile.

 Safety and tolerability profile are expected to resemble the adult profile.
