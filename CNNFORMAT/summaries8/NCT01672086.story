(secondQuint)Active Surveillance Post-Approval Atudy of the Stelkast Surpass Acetabular System.

 This active surveillance study is intended to evaluate the survivorship and long-term safety and effectiveness of the Stelkast Surpass Acetabular System.

 Neither the patient nor the surgeon are blinded to treatment.

 The study will compare the Surpass' survivorship to the survivorship observed in a historical control group established by a meta-analysis.

 The evaluation will be conducted for a period of ten years.

 These evaluations will be recorded through onsite visits and/or mailings sent to physicians requesting deidentified patient-level data for subjects implanted with the Surpass system.
