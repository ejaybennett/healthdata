(fifthQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Single Daily Dose of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole for Treatment of Complicated Appendicitis in Children.

 The study was conducted at the Pediatric Surgery Department at HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.

 Included were children age 1-14 years with complicated appendicitis that was defined by one of the followings: 1.

 Demonstration by abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography of appendix perforation and/or peri-appendicular abscess 2.

 Demonstration by abdominal ultrasound of free fluid, and signs of diffuse peritoneal irritation in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen 3.

 At surgery performed for suspected non complicated appendicitis.

 In a patient with perforate appendicitis that was diagnosed at surgery, appendectomy was performed by one of the 4 senior pediatric surgeons on call at the time of the child's admission.

 Exclusion criteria were: documented allergy to any of the study medications, acute or renal insufficiency at admission, and severe septic shock at admission.

 Therapeutic approach: After the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis was established, patients were randomly assigned to therapy with either once daily of ceftriaxone and metronidazole or ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole.

 Therapy was change to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients who were still febrile at day 7-10 of the admission (if not given before), based on the clinical situation, and in all febrile patients at 11 day of the admission .

 All patients had also been treats after inclusion with pain control medications, no oral food or fluid , and intravenous hydration as necessary.

 Nasogastric tubes were not used routinely.

 On the fifth admission day patients who were stable, a febrile, could tolerate diet and had Complete blood count within normal limits were discharged home with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy for further 7 days.

 Follow-up at the admission: CBC and renal and liver function tests were obtained before starting the antibiotic treatment and repeated on day 4 in all patients.

 In the group treated with AGM, serum trough gentamicin concentration was drawn before the fourth dose with normal level considered as SD.
