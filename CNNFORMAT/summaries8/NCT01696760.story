(fifthQuint)Aspirin and Compression Devices for VTE Prophylaxis in Orthopaedic Oncology.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To perform a randomized prospective study to determine efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)+pneumatic compression device (PCD) prophylaxis compared to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)+PCD in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures for musculoskeletal neoplasms (MSN) of the pelvis and lower extremity.

 II.

 To prove that ASA+PCD is clinically equivalent to or better than LMWH+PCD in providing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in this patient population and results in fewer major bleeding complications.

 III.

 To measure rates of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary outcomes.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To measure secondary outcomes including rates of readmission, reoperation, bleeding complications (including hematoma formation and prolonged wound drainage), and death.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and wear PCD on days 1-28 after surgery.

 ARM II: Patients receive enoxaparin subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) and wear PCD on days 1-28 after surgery.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months.

 Aspirin and Compression Devices for VTE Prophylaxis in Orthopaedic Oncology@highlight

This is a research study to compare the efficacy of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and pneumatic compression devices versus enoxaparin (also known as Lovenox) and pneumatic compression devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis in patients with pelvic and lower extremity malignant tumors and undergoing surgery.

 Pneumatic compression devices are also known as sequential compression devices and are inflatable compression sleeves that are placed around patient's legs to reduce the risk of clot formation deep vein thrombosis.

 Pneumatic compression devices are made of a soft material that wraps around the lower leg and periodically squeeze the calf.

 A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot.

 Most hospitalized patients wear these as a preventive measure.

 Pneumatic compression devices alone are not sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation.

 Therefore, medicines, such as aspirin and enoxaparin are utilized.

 Both drugs are used for prevention, but there are no studies in patients with musculoskeletal tumors which have determined whether one drug is better than another.

 The knowledge gained from this study will determine whether aspirin and pneumatic compression devices is the same or better than enoxaparin and pneumatic compression devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis in this patient population and may result in fewer wound and bleeding complications
