(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Two Different Repeat Doses of GSK2190915 on the QTc Interval.

.

 This is a randomized, placebo controlled, four way crossover thorough QT study to evaluate the effect of repeat dose GSK2190915 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects.

 Approximately 48 subjects will receive oral placebo, GSK2190915 (100mg or 1000mg) and moxifloxacin (400mg).

 GSK2190915 or matching placebo will be given once daily for 5 days with a moxifloxacin matching placebo given on Day 5.

 Moxifloxacin (positive control) will be given as a single-blind single dose on Day 5 with placebo administered on Days 1-4.

 Individual time-matched changes from baseline in QTcF (difference from placebo) for GSK2190915 will be determined 0-24 hours after dosing on Day 5 (primary endpoint).

 Secondary endpoints will include changes from baseline in QTcF, QTcB and QT interval at each timepoint after 5 days dosing of GSK2190915 and single dose moxifloxacin (400mg).

 Plasma concentrations on Day 5 (0-24 hours) and pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK2190915 will also be derived.

@highlight

This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, four way crossover, in which the the effect of GSK2190915 on the QTc interval is assessed.

 Healthy subjects will recieve a 5 day course of each of the following; oral placebo, GSK2190915 100mg, GSK2190915 1000mg and moxifloxacin 400mg (single dose) with a weeks washout prior to starting the next course.

 Key assessments include a 12- lead electrocardiogram and pharmacokinetic testing.

 Safety will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate, clinical laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events .
