(fifthQuint)Health Promotion on Young Adults With High Risk Disability for Mental Health.

 Early finding for people with high mental risk plays the important role in mental health promotion.

 In literature, before specific psychotic symptoms appear, individuals may experience a period of nonspecific symptoms and growing functional impairment.

 Early interventions may alter the natural course of mental diseases and improve treatment outcomes.

 So that, the purpose of this study is to develop a screen and prevention mode for identifying young adults with high risk status of mental health disability.

 The psychosocial intervention strategies for emotional and cognitive support in prevention model based on health promotion theory will be used for this study.

 Participants in this experimental design study will be randomly assigned into experimental and control groups.

 Four scales and objective physical assessments are used for evaluating study outcomes.

 The pre- and post-test will be held before and one week after prevention interventions.

 In addition, follow-ups will be included for understanding long-term outcomes of the effectiveness of the screen prevention model.
