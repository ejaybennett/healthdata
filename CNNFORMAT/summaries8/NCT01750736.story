(thirdQuint)Manual Therapy and Augmented Exercise for Neck Pain.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if specific neck exercises intended to augment specific manual therapy treatments result in better outcomes than standard neck exercises in people with neck pain.

 Clinical tests and measurements as well as patient questionnaires will be completed and compared between groups.

 A secondary purpose is to determine if self report of activity is correlated with functional improvements.

 We hypothesize that a specifically applied home exercise that augments the effects of the manual therapy intervention will lead to improvements in outcomes in patients with neck pain.

 We hypothesize that higher reports of self activity will be correlated with improvements in outcomes.

 Manual Therapy and Augmented Exercise for Neck Pain@highlight

Manual therapy and exercise have shown to be beneficial for people with neck pain, however it is not clear how outcomes following a general exercise program compare to specific exercises intended to augment a specific manual/hands-on intervention.

 This study will compare outcomes following manual therapy and a specific exercise program with manual therapy and a general exercise program.
