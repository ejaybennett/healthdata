(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy of Desensitization Therapy in Sensitized Participants Awaiting Heart Transplantation.

 Bortezomib works by decreasing plasma cells in the blood.

 Plasma cells produce antibodies.

 Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood.

 Plasma cells and antibodies produced by plasma cells can be involved in organ rejection after transplantation.

 This trial will evaluate if decreasing plasma cells and antibodies with bortezomib and plasmapheresis can reduce complications while participants are waiting for their heart transplant.

 The evaluation of efficacy is defined by a lower complication rate while on the heart transplant waitlist.
