(secondQuint)Vitamin D and Vascular Health in Children.

 Our primary objective is to determine, in obese and overweight children aged 10 to 18 years with vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL), the efficacy of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status; and to assess whether these effects are dose-dependent.

 As a secondary objective, we will examine the vitamin D supplementation-induced effect on adipokines and inflammatory markers relevant to CVD risk.

 In a double-masked, controlled trial, we will randomize 252 eligible children to receive either 600 IU (conventional supplementation), or 1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced supplementation) of vitamin D3 daily for 6 months.

 Vitamin D and Vascular Health in Children@highlight

In this study, we will test the central hypothesis that enhancement of vitamin D status in obese and overweight children will improve their vascular health and their cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome risk profile.
