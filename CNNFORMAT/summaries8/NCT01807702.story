(thirdQuint)13C-Pyruvate Breath Test.

 Subjects will be screened with a history and physical and have baseline laboratory values drawn to assure that the subject is healthy.

Subjects will fast for 12 hours before the test.

 The next day they will receive a dose of 25mg of pyruvate dissolved in 80ml of Crystal Light.

 The pyruvate used in this study will be prepared with a nonradioactive form of carbon, called a stable isotope.

 It poses no hazard to the subject's health.

 About 50 mls of blood will be drawn over a 120 minute time period from an IV catheter placed in the arm.

 Subjects will also be asked to exhale into a plastic tube about 12 times in 120 minutes to collect 13C carbon dioxide (13CO2).

 Cells from inside of the mouth will be collected by subjects swishing a tablespoon of mouth wash for one minute and then spitting it into a sterile plastic tube.

 At least one week following the first admission subjects will return to repeat the above procedure and receive 25mg of dichloroacetate (DCA) one hour before receiving the pyruvate.

 Then the same samples will be collected.

 Subjects have the option of doing the tests 4 times receiving the DCA on the last visit.
