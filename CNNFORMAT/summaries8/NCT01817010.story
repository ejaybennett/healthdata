(thirdQuint)Strength and Function Following Total Hip Arthroplasty.

 The participants will be enrolled and following surgery, randomized into one of two treatment groups (CMC or CON).

 Prior to randomization, both groups will participate in two weeks of home rehabilitation consisting mobility training and activities of daily living.

 After randomization, the CMC group will receive physical therapy 2x/ week for 8 weeks from a licensed physical therapist and member of the investigative team starting 2 weeks after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).

 The CON group will continue activities provided by their home rehabilitation therapist for 8 weeks.

 The CON group will then participate in the CMC intervention beginning 10 weeks after THA.

 These patients will complete pre-operative and post-operative testing as described above.

 The CMC group will receive a multi-component program focused on rehabilitation of the abdominal and core musculature, neuromuscular re-education through therapeutic exercise as well as hip and knee muscle strengthening beginning 2 weeks after THA.

 The CON group will participate in physical therapist recommended activities based on their home rehabilitation and then will complete the same multi-component rehabilitation intervention beginning 10 weeks after THA.

 Strength and Function Following Total Hip Arthroplasty@highlight

To determine if patients who receive an 8 week, comprehensive, multi-component rehabilitation program (CMC) have better strength and functional performance compared to a control group (CON).

 The investigators hypothesize that functional performance and strength in the muscles surrounding the hip and the knee will be greater in the multi-component rehabilitation group compared to the control group.
