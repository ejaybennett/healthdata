(secondQuint)Study of Erythromycin in GER-Associated Apnea of the Newborn.

 A randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine whether erythromycin, a drug known to enhance gut motility, will improve the incidence of GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardiac and/or hypoxic events.

 The investigators have two aims: 1) to examine the relationship between GER and apnea, bradycardia, and/or desaturation (ABD) events by simultaneously employing a unique computer algorithm developed at the University of Virginia to measure ABD events and an Multi-channel Intra-luminal Impedance (MII) pH monitoring to measure GER episodes.

 2) In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will study whether erythromycin decreases GER and GER-associated apnea, bradycardia and/or hypoxia in premature infants.
