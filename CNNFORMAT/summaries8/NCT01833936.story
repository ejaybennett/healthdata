(thirdQuint)E-Stim and Achilles Tendon Repair Study.

 The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the use of electrical stimulation on muscle cross-sectional area and muscle fascicle length following post-operative Achilles tendon surgery.

 Patients will be randomly assigned to receive an electrical stimulation unit (Compex(R), DJO Global, San Diego, CA).

 Twenty of these units will be experimental and 20 will be sham.

 E-Stim and Achilles Tendon Repair Study@highlight

Calf muscle atrophy (muscle degeneration) is common following Achilles tendon repair due to the immobilization period necessary to ensure optimal healing.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) after Achilles tendon surgery will reduce calf muscle atrophy.
