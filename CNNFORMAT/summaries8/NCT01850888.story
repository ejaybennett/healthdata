(fifthQuint)MIBG for Refractory Neuroblastoma and Pheochromocytoma.

 Primary Objective is to provide access to therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

 Secondary Objective is to assess disease response to 131I-MIBG therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

 Tertiary Objectives are to 1) gain more information about the toxicities of 131I-MIBG therapy; 2) assess improvement of symptoms, including pain and fatigue, for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma who are receiving 131I-MIBG therapy.

 - The therapeutic dose of 131I-MIBG will be based on the following: 1.

 Minimum dose of 10 mCi/kg for patients without a stem cell source whose renal function is above the upper limit of normal but still meets eligibility criteria.

 2.

 Dose of 12 mCi/kg for patients without a stem cell source with normal renal function and meets other eligibility criteria.

 3.

 Dose of > 12 mCi/kg to 18 mCi/kg maximum at investigator's discretion for patients meeting eligibility criteria with stem cells available.

 - A urinary catheter and intravenous fluids will be used for bladder protection, and potassium iodide solution for thyroid Protection.

 - G-CSF is recommended for patients with ANC less than 750 after MIBG infusion.

 - hematopoietic stem cell infusion is recommended for patients with grade 4 hematologic toxicity following 131I-MIBG therapy that continues to have an ANC 2 weeks and any patient requiring platelet transfusion more than two times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks.

 - Follow-up will be done until disease progression, death or other therapies are initiated.

 MIBG for Refractory Neuroblastoma and Pheochromocytoma@highlight

This is a best available therapy/compassionate use single institution study designed to determine the palliative benefit and toxicity of 131I-MIBG in patients with progressive neuroblastoma and metastatic pheochromocytoma who are not eligible for therapies of higher priority.

 Patients may receive a range of doses depending on stem cell availability and tumor involvement of bone marrow.

 Response rate, toxicity, and time to progression and death will be evaluated.
