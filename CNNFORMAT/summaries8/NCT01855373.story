(secondQuint)Comparing Blood Sugar Levels and Endothelial Function of PEAK ATP With GlycoCarn, PEAK ATP and GlycoCarn Supplements.

 This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the study substances utilized to support improved healthy levels of blood sugar and endothelial function.

 Each subject will be randomized to receive a specific dose of PEAK ATP(R) (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt)with GlycoCarn(R) (Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP (United States Pharmacopeia) , PEAK ATP(R) (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt) and GlycoCarn(R) (Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP )or Placebo twice daily.

 Participants will undergo assessment of blood tests, brachial ultrasound for determining the change in flow mediated dilation, body weight, % body fat, BMI, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure.

 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of PEAK ATP(R) with GlycoCarn(R), PEAK ATP(R) and GlycoCarn(R) on improving levels of blood sugar via assessment of plasma glucose.

 Secondary objectives: 1.

 To assess flow-mediated dilation as determined by brachial ultrasound evaluation.

 2.

 To assess the effect on changes in blood levels of HbA1C, high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), Insulin, Nitric Oxide (NOx), Malondialdehyde (MAL), Soluble Inter-cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-Selectin.

 3.

 To assess the effect on body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), % body fat as measured by skin caliper, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure.

 4.

 To assess the effect on general and sexual health for males and females as determined through questionnaires.
