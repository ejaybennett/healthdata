(firstQuint)Study Of Diabetic Nephropathy With Atrasentan.

 The study objective is to evaluate the effect of atrasentan compared with placebo on time to doubling of serum creatinine or the onset of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who are treated with the maximum tolerated labeled daily dose (MTLDD) of a Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitor.

 In addition, the study will assess the effects of atrasentan compared with placebo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, urine albumin excretion, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as well as on the impact on quality of life in subjects with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
