(fifthQuint)Effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine on Preservation Solution During Liver Transplantation.

 The reason of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the use of n-acetylcysteine in liver transplant, by administering it in the perfusion liquid, at the time of extraction of the liver of the donor to improve the damage caused by ischemia / reperfusion.

 The dose is 400 mg in the portal perfusion liquid.

 The study included all considered valid and perfused livers.

 Patients are randomized to contain no drug or n-acetylcysteine by randomization.

 Then analyzed using blood tests and in the receiver and daily during the first seven days post-transplant hepatic dysfunction parameters, in order to objectify if liver function improves after administration of the antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine ).

 Safety assessments were performed with intraoperative monitoring anesthetic depth, postoperative parameters of liver and kidney function and graft pathologic examination after perfusion.

 Effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine on Preservation Solution During Liver Transplantation@highlight

Evaluate the effectiveness of the administration produced antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), decreasing the incidence of primary graft dysfunction and primary failure.

 The degree of dysfunction will be monitored by the method of LIMON, metabonomics techniques and according to the latest published validation Liver Transplantation (16 943-949 2010), total billirrubina greater than 10 mg / dl, INR greater than 1.

6 in the seventh postoperative day and alanine or aspartate aminotransferase greater than 2000 IU / L in the first seven days.

 Liver dysfunction is considered, the presence of a transaminase value> 2000 IU / L 1-7 postoperative day or BT> 10 mg / dl or INR> 1.

6, both only in the 7th postoperative day (Olthoff et al Liver Transplantation 16,943 -949 2010).
