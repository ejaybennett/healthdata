(firstQuint)Risk Assessment of Peritoneal Dialysis Failure Based on Catheter Tip Location.

.

 Radiolucency of the peritoneal dialysis catheter, allow to classify the location of the tip into 4 radiographic planes.

 Plane 1: below the zone of a line on the head of the femur.

 Plane 2: is the area above the plane 1 and below a line connecting the two iliac spines.

 Plane 3: is the area that is above the plane 2 and below a line connecting the upper edge of the two iliac crests.

 Plane 4: is the area located above the plane 3.

 Risk Assessment of Peritoneal Dialysis Failure Based on Catheter Tip Location.

@highlight

The location of the catheter tip in radiographic planes 1 and 2, is a protection factor for the mechanical performance of peritoneal Dialysis.

 Instead radiographic planes 3 and 4 are risk factors.
