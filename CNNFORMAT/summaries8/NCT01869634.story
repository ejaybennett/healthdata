(thirdQuint)Mechanisms of Immune Reconstitution & Reduced Immune Activation Following Darunavir-based ART.

 Rationale Infection with HIV causes significant morbidity and mortality, even among individuals who are virologically suppressed with combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

 ART is effective in prolonging life and enabling individuals who are HIV positive to live near-normal life spans.

 However, these individuals are increasingly developing a number of chronic diseases of aging, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

 The proposed studies will examine the role of highly active antiretroviral therapy in restoring the mucosal immunity and the systemic effect on immune activation, bacterial translocation, and change in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease risk.

Potent HIV suppression with Darunavir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) will lead to repopulation of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T-cell populations, normalization of systemic immune activation, and improved HIV-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
