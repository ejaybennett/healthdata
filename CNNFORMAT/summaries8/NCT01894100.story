(fifthQuint)Shoe Lifts for Leg Length Inequality in Adults With Knee or Hip Symptoms.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the optimal clinical assessment method(s) for leg length inequality (LLI), determine if there is an association between foot posture (flat foot, normal, and high arch) and LLI, and gather preliminary data on lift therapy as a treatment for LLI and knee/hip symptoms.

 The specific aims of the project are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Determine the validity and reliability of 4 clinical methods for assessing LLI.

 Specific Aim 2: Determine differences in static and dynamic foot postures between longer and shorter limbs.

 Specific Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of conducting a specific lift therapy intervention among individuals with a LLI and knee or hip pain, refining procedures as needed.

 Public Health Impact: Results from the proposed research will be used to: 1) improve diagnosis of LLI by providing evidence on the various assessment methods for the clinicians who most frequently use clinical methods (i.

e.

, physical therapists, chiropractors, podiatrists, and primary care physicians), and 2) develop and test new non-pharmacologic/non-invasive intervention strategies aimed at reducing pain and improving function in individuals with osteoarthritis and LLI.

 Shoe Lifts for Leg Length Inequality in Adults With Knee or Hip Symptoms@highlight

Limb length inequality is when a person has one leg that is longer than the other.

 This research will look at correcting limb length inequality in adults with knee or hip symptoms.

 This study will examine whether ways of measuring leg length inequality in the clinic are valid and reliable, determine whether foot posture (flat foot, normal, and high arch) is related to leg length inequality, and determine whether shoe lifts are a helpful treatment for leg length inequality and knee/hip symptoms.
