(firstQuint)The Effect of Creatine on Muscle Loss.

 Seven days of one-legged knee immobilisation in young subjects with creatine or Placebo supplementation.

 A randomly selected leg is immobilized for seven days.

 Muscle mass and strength will be determined and muscle biopsies will be collected before and immediately after immobilisation.

 A week after the cast is removed we will assess any differences in recovery between intervention groups.
