(fifthQuint)Soluble Fibre Enriched CHO Food Study.

 Literature to date points to beneficial glycemic effects from consumption of soluble fibre; however, whole grain products consumption is below recommendations possibly due to the presence of unappealing characteristic organoleptic properties.

 White, refined products are still the choice of the general public.

 As such, we propose to investigate the feasibility of increasing health benefits of commonly consumed white, refined carbohydrate products by incorporating a soluble fibre blend.

 This research is important to determine the feasibility of developing fibre enriched carbohydrate foods that maintains the original organoleptic properties and is effective in reducing postprandial blood glucose response.

 35 subjects will be recruited in phase I to complete a sensory evaluation on the test foods.

 Following tasting of the control and fibre-enriched samples, data on each subjects' liking or disliking will be collected through a 9-point hedonic scale.

 An acute crossover RCT will be conducted in phase II by 10 healthy individuals.

 Subjects will be randomized to consume one the treatments at each visit and blood glucose levels over 120min and satiety scores will be measured.

 Soluble Fibre Enriched CHO Food Study@highlight

The proposed study will examine the effects of incorporating a soluble fibre blend into commonly consumed refined carbohydrate foods on sensory parameters and postprandial blood glucose.

 A sensory evaluation will be conducted in phase I to asses for differences between the control and fibre enriched samples of white bread, mashed potatoes, muffin, hot breakfast cereal.

 Phase II will be investigating the postprandial blood glucose responses of the 8 test foods from phase I.
