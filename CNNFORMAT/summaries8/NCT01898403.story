(thirdQuint)Lymph Node Mapping Using Indocyanine Green Solution in Diagnosing Patients With Malignant Melanoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To show that indocyanine green (ICG) (indocyanine green solution) is equal to both isosulfan blue (ISB) and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TSC) and will allow all lymph node mapping to occur in the operating room (OR).

 OUTLINE: Patients receive peri-tumoral, intradermal injections of isosulfan blue and indocyanine green solution.

 During surgery, patients undergo identification of the sentinel lymph node and imaging using a laser with videocamera (SPY Elite camera).

This clinical trial compares and contrasts lymph node mapping using indocyanine green (IC-GREEN), isosulfan blue (ISB), and TSC and Lymphoscintigraphy with 99-technetium (99Tc) sulfur colloid (TSC).

 Study participants with malignant melanoma will undergo all 3 evaluations to assess the extent of the spread of the melanoma.
