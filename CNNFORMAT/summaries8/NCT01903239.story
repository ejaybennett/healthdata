(thirdQuint)Long Term Prospective Study Evaluating Effectiveness of Narrow Margins for Low-Risk Head and Neck Basal Cell Carcinomas.

 Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in the US.

 Most are treated by surgical excision.

 Excision margins vary by tumor size, anatomic location, histological subtype, and surgeon preference.

 Published recommendations and follow up observation times vary.

 Current clinical practice supports the 4 mm excision margin; however, this can be a disservice to the patient by potentially excising additional normal tissue unnecessarily and yielding larger scars.

 Considering healthcare costs, both the excision and repair components are usually billed by size measurements.

 Determining the narrowest excision margin to give an acceptable clinical cure could feasibly reduce this expenditure.

The purpose of this study is to determine the narrowest excision margin for head and neck Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) tumors satisfying the National Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) (NCCN) low-risk for recurrence clinical and histopathological criteria that gives an acceptable (95%) clinical cure-rate over a 3 year follow-up period.

 Margins of 1 and 2mm are evaluated.
