(secondQuint)Back to the Future: Bridging the Hospital to Home Continuum After Hip Fracture.

 The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial design to inform the development of a larger scale study to test effectiveness of a clinician supported telephonic self management intervention for older adults after hip fracture.

 The primary aim is to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and the secondary aim is to measure statistical trends on quality of life at 4 months after fracture in community dwelling older adults.

 In parallel, we will conduct a process evaluation to ascertain key features of the intervention via qualitative interviews of participants and health care professionals involved in delivery of the intervention.
