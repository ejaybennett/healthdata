(secondQuint)A Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy Study of DRM01B Topical Gel.

 This is a Phase 1/2a study enrolling 6 healthy volunteer subjects followed by 100 subjects with acne vulgaris.

 Safety data from the healthy volunteer stage will be reviewed prior to enrolling subjects with acne vulgaris.

 Phase 1 will be an open label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of DRM01B Topical Gel.

 Six (6) healthy volunteers will be enrolled and apply DRM01B gel for 1 week to the face.

 Adverse events and local tolerability will be assessed at all study visits.

 Phase 2a will be a randomized, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DRM01B topical gel in subjects with acne vulgaris.

 Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled and treated with study drug for 12 weeks.

 Safety will be assessed, at specified time points during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital signs.

 Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (e.

g.

, inflammatory, noninflammatory) and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for acne.
