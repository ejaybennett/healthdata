(fifthQuint)Problem Specific Templates for Electronic Hospital Documentation.

 This is a prospective cohort study, which will examine the effects of Problem Specific Templates on quality, accuracy, and efficiency of physician documentation practices.

 The Hospitalist physicians will be the subjects.

 All physicians of the Hospital Medicine Service will be invited to participate.

 For the intervention, participating Hospitalists will be trained on the use of templates for 20 common hospital problems.

 Once trained, the Hospitalists will be asked to use these templates for a one-month period.

 Pre-intervention and post-intervention medical records will be compared using chart reviews, validated document assessment instruments, physician surveys, and electronic medical record time auditing.

 Problem Specific Templates for Electronic Hospital Documentation@highlight

The emergence of electronic documentation has led to multiple new challenges for physicians.

 Despite positive expectations, many physicians have received electronic health systems with mixed results.

 Review of current literature has identified the following reasons for concern: increased time required for documentation, deteriorating quality of notes, mindless use of copy-and-paste functions, and fragmentation of clinical work from poorly designed computing workflows.

 The study of template use has not been done in a large scale or with clear outcome measurements.

 The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Problem Specific Templates on quality, accuracy, and efficiency of physician documentation practices.
