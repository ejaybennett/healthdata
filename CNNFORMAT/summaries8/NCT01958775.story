(firstQuint)Regulation of Intestinal and Hepatic Lipoprotein Production by Glucagon Like Peptide 2.

 Study A: Using constant feeding with a nasoduodenal tube and stable isotope infusion, mathematical modelling will be utilised to measure lipoprotein production and clearance.

 The lipoproteins assessed will be apoB-100 from the liver and apoB-48 from the intestine.

 StudyB: Volunteers will be given a liquid meal with retinyl palmitate (vitamin A) to label chylomicrons made from the meal.

 7 hours later they will be given GLP-2 or placebo.

 Measurements of plasma and TRL(triglyceride rich lipoprotein) triglyceride and TRL retinyl palmitate will be carried out to see whether GLP-2 increases these parameters.
