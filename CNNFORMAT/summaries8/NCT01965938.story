(fifthQuint)RIFL (Rigid and Flexing Laryngoscope) vs.

 Fiberoptic Bronchoscope.

 Patients who require general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation will be identified the night prior to their surgery based upon the examination documented in their preoperative history and physical.

 If their body mass index achieves a calculated score of 35 or greater or they have an oropharyngeal class 4 airway then they will qualify to participate.

 After written informed consent is obtained, The intubation method would be randomized as one of two groups: intubation via use of the fiberoptic bronchoscope or the RIFL.

 The intubation attempt will be terminated if the SpO2 100sec.

 If terminated, the patient will be mask ventilated and the attending anesthesiologist would determine the subsequent technique that will be used for airway management.

 RIFL (Rigid and Flexing Laryngoscope) vs.

 Fiberoptic Bronchoscope@highlight

We will conduct a randomized trial comparing the success rate and time to intubation using the RIFL vs.

 the fiberoptic bronchoscope, as the latter is commonly held to be the gold standard of difficult airway devices.

 Specifically, we wish to compare the of intubation between the two devices in patients with potentially difficult airways as defined by an oropharyngeal class 3-4, BMI greater than 35, or in patients with a history of difficult intubation using direct laryngoscopy.
