(secondQuint)Sequencing CBT for Child Anxiety: CBT Plus Sertraline Versus Switch to Sertraline.

 This project proposes to conduct a pilot study to collect preliminary data on a 'personalized adaptive treatment' approach for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.

 All youth patients in this two site study will first receive CBT and all then will be re-assessed at mid-treatment (8 sessions).

 Patients who show a partial response or no response following 8 sessions of CBT will be randomized to either a switch to SRT alone or CBT augmentation with SRT.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in combination with sertraline (SRT) is more effective than SRT alone in treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorders (after an initial 8 weeks of CBT).
