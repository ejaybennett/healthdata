(secondQuint)Adherence to Treatment, Safety and Tolerability Study of the Medical Information Device #1 (MIND1) in Subjects With Schizophrenia or Bipolar I Disorder.

 Poor adherence to medication is a well-recognized problem in psychiatric patients and is a barrier to achieving optimal health.

 The MIND1 System is being developed to objectively and precisely monitor and measure real-time medication adherence; and to potentially enhance adherence.

 The MIND1 System includes oral aripiprazole with an embedded ingestible event marker (IEM), a Wearable Sensor, and a computerized device and accessories.

 This is a trial designed to evaluate adherence to treatment with, and safety and tolerability of, the medical information device #1 (MIND1) system in subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

 This 12-week, single-arm trial will include male and female subjects 18 to 65years (inclusive) with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder who are currently treated with oral aripiprazole.
