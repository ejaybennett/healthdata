(secondQuint)Brain Densitometric Assessment With Axial Computerized Tomography After Severe Brain Trauma.

.

 Quantitative analysis of brain and structures in it, in terms of volume, weight and density, in patients with severe brain trauma, using MALUNA dedicated software to process DICOM images.

 1.

 st endpoint: compare these data with those obtained by CT scans analysis of patients that recur to this kind of diagnostic investigation for non-traumatic events and with negative diagnostic related to cerebral pathological implication.

 2.

 nd endpoint: relate data obtained with clinical evaluation of the patient (cerebral physiology and outcome) 3.

 rd endpoint: evaluate differences in terms of volume, weight and density of brain and its structures, between patients with diffuse cerebral injury and those with localized lesions.
