(thirdQuint)Evaluation of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Oral Dose of EDP-788.

 Subjects are enrolled in successive cohorts and are randomized to receive either EDP-788 or placebo capsules.

 If the safety profile of the drug is acceptable, based upon review of blinded data, the cohort receiving the next higher dose will be treated.

 Up to 8 cohorts will be recruited.

 All subjects receive a single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo).

 Subjects in Cohort C will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo) approximately 2 weeks after the first dose.

 The second dose will be administered as a liquid suspension rather than as a capsule formulation.

 The purpose of the second dose is to estimate the bioavailability of the capsule formulation relative to the suspension.

 Subjects in Cohort E will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo) approximately 2 weeks after the first does.

 The second dose will be administered with a standard test meal.

 The purpose of the second dose is to estimate the effect of food on absorption of EDP-788.

 Evaluation of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Oral Dose of EDP-788@highlight

The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of single doses of orally administered EDP-788.

 Secondary objectives of the study are: - To describe the pharmacokinetics of EDP-788 (and its metabolite EDP-322) after single doses of orally administered drug - To estimate the bioavailability of EDP-788 capsules relative to an oral liquid suspension - To estimate the effect of co-administration of food on the absorption of EDP-788
