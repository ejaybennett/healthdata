(secondQuint)Rare Kidney Stone Consortium Biobank.

 Biologic samples will be stored in the biobank from well characterized patients with primary hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, APRT deficiency, and Dent disease, and from their family members, for use in future research.

 This will help to advance our understanding of disease expression and the factors associated with kidney injury in these four diseases with the overall goal of developing new treatments to preserve kidney function and reduce nephrocalcinosis and stone formation.
