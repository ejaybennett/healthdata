(firstQuint)An Open-label Phase I Study of Orally Available Novel Small-molecule Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFR) 1,2,3 and 4 Inhibitor, ASP5878 at Single and Multiple Doses in Patients With Solid Tumors.

 This study consists of two parts.

 In the dose-escalation part, ASP5878 (orally available novel small-molecule FGFR 1,2,3 and 4 inhibitor, multiple dosing once-a-day (q.

d.

), multiple dosing twice-a-day (b.

i.

d.

) or 5-day on/2-day off dosing twice-a-day (5on-2off)) is administered to patients with solid tumors in an increasing dose manner, and the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated in these patients.

 Cycle 0 consists of 3 days and Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles consist of 28 days each in the dose-escalation part.

 In the expansion part, 16mg twice-a-day 5-day on/2-day off dose of ASP5878 (5on-2off) is administered to patients with solid tumors and safety, PK, PD and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated.

 The expansion part starts from Cycle 1 and each cycle consists of 28 days.
