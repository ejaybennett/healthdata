(secondQuint)Evaluation of Dynamic Stability in the Low Back Pain Patient.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: To compare lmax in the different experimental conditions within each group (chronic lower back pain patients, healthy volunteers).

 To compare changes in lmax for low back pain patients at D7 and 6 weeks.

 Evaluation of Dynamic Stability in the Low Back Pain Patient@highlight

The main objective of this study is to compare on day 0 the maximum Lyapunov exponent (lmax, an indicator of local dynamic stability) of chronic low back pain patients versus that of healthy volunteers matched for age ( 5 years), sex and body mass index (BMI 15% of low back pain patients).
