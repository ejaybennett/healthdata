(secondQuint)Effect of Milk Oligosaccharides and Bifidobacteria on the Intestinal Microflora of Children With Autism.

 This study investigates the feasibility, tolerability, and effects of a dietary supplement on the intestinal flora of children with autism spectrum disorders.

 This study is divided into two parts, each five weeks long, with a two week break in between.

 During one part of the study, a prebiotic (milk oligosaccharides from bovine colostrum) will be given.

 During the other part of the study, the synbiotic composed of the prebiotic and probiotic (bifidobacterium infantis) will be given.

 Stool will be analyzed at the end of each study arm to determine content of bifidobacteria.

 On May 8, 2018, we updated the study start and completion dates to the actual (instead of anticipated) dates.
