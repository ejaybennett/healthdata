(fifthQuint)Intervention Module AGES.

 Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a structured psychoeducational group intervention for adolescents with early onset psychosis and their families.

 The intervention was implemented in parallel in 2 separate groups, by focusing specifically on problem solving strategies and structured psychosis-related information to manage daily life hassles associated with the disease in order to manage crises and prevent relapses.

 Method: The investigators performed a 9-month, randomized, rater-blind clinical trial involving adolescent patients with early onset psychosis and 1 or both of their parents.

 The primary outcomes were number of hospitalizations, days of hospitalization, and visits to the emergency department.

 The secondary outcome measures were clinical variables and family environment and well being.

 Intervention Module AGES@highlight

The AGES-CM consortium aims to study the interaction between the polymorphisms of the candidate genes related with neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, brain progressive changes, cognitive functioning and stressful life events (prospective- and retrospectively assessed) and the association of the interactions with structural and functional brain measures, neuropsychological performance, biochemical and oxidative status in both in patients and controls.

 The investigators study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a parallel, structured, and specific psychoeducational group intervention (PE) for adolescent patients and their families by comparing it with treatment as usual).
