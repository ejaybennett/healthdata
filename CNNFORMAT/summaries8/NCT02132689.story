(thirdQuint)Comparison of Thrombgolytic and Anticoagulation Therapy in Submassive Pulmonary Embolism.

 Standard treatment of moderate risk pulmonary embolism constitutes of sole anticoagulation therapy.

 In case of troponin positivity and/or echocardiographic findings as i.

e.

 thrombi in RV thrombolytic therapy should be considered.

 The aim of this trial is to compare the two treatment modalities in their ability to reduce/predict 12 month end-point: pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, exercise capacity.

 Comparison of Thrombgolytic and Anticoagulation Therapy in Submassive Pulmonary Embolism@highlight

Currently there is no clear guidance for the treatment of moderate risk of pulmonary embolism.

 The aim of the study is to compare two different therapeutic modalities - standard anticoagulation versus thrombolytic treatment followed by anticoagulation in standard regimen as stated in the pulmonary embolism guidelines.
