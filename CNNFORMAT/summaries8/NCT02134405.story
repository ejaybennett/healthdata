 Rebamipide in Combination With Esomeprazole in the Management of Asian Patients With Functional Dyspepsia@highlight

This is a multi-Asian-centre randomised controlled trial of Rebamipide alone vs Rebamipide with Esomeprazole in the treatment of adult patients with Functional Dyspepsia.

 The hypothesis is that a combination therapy is superior to mono-therapy in the control of patients' symptoms and quality of life improvement.
