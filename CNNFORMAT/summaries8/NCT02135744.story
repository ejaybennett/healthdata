(thirdQuint)Pre-Discharge Bundle for Patients With Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to Reduce Readmissions.

 Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) pose burdens to the healthcare system and patients.

 A current gap in knowledge is whether a pre-discharge screening and educational tool, administered to patients with COPD, reduces readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.

 A single center, randomized trial of patients admitted with AECOPD.

 Patients will be randomized to control (standard care) or "bundle" group in which patients receive smoking cessation counseling, screening for gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression or anxiety, standardized inhaler teaching, and a 48-hour post-discharge phone call.

 Pre-Discharge Bundle for Patients With Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to Reduce Readmissions@highlight

Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) pose burdens to the healthcare system and patients.

 The aim of this study was to determine whether a screening and educational tool, administered prior to discharge, would result in a decrease in the rate of hospital readmissions.
