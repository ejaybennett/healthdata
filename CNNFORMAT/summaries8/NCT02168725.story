(fifthQuint)Dose-escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Briciclib in Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This will be a Phase I, 2-stage, open-label, dose-escalating, multicenter study of the 2-hour, once-a-week intravenous (IV) administration of briciclib in 3-week cycles, in up to 54 adult patients with advanced cancer and solid tumors.

 The study will be conducted in 2 stages: a dose-escalation stage to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) confirmation stage.

 Patients with stable disease (SD) or response may remain treated on study until progression.

 Dose-escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Briciclib in Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

The main objectives of this study are to determine the safety profile of briciclib, an experimental anti-cancer drug, as it is administered intravenously once weekly as escalating doses in adult patients with advanced cancer and solid tumors, and to determine the highest dose of briciclib that can be safely given.

 Secondary objectives are to determine how the amount of briciclib in circulation changes over time and how much briciclib gets into the urine for excretion, and to document potential anti-tumor effects of briciclib.
