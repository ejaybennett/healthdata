(thirdQuint)Postoperative Radiotherapy of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Accelerated vs.

 Conventional Fractionation.

 This study is a randomized multicentric trial.

 Within this study an accelerated irradiation schedule (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) will be compared with the currently used conventional fractionation schedule (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) for postoperative radiotherapy with photons or protons in patients with NSCLC.

 The primary endpoint is locoregional tumour control after 36 months.

 Secondary endpoints are overall survival of patients, local recurrence-free and distant metastases-free survival after 36 months, acute and late toxicity as well as quality of life for both treatment methods.

 Postoperative Radiotherapy of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Accelerated vs.

 Conventional Fractionation@highlight

In this randomized multicentric phase II study it will be investigated whether an accelerated postoperative radiotherapy with photons or protons (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose) may improve locoregional tumour control in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in comparison to conventional fractionation (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy single dose).
