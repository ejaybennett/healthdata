(firstQuint)Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus Standard Analgesia in Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA).

 Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel(R)) is a local anesthetic made up of liposomal encapsulated bupivacaine.

 It is designed to be injected at the time of surgery into the local soft tissues.

 Because of its unique liposomal delivery system, Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel(R)) has been shown to provide up to 96 hours of pain relief following surgeries.

 This makes it an attractive option in total joint arthroplasty patients.

 Combined with the proven efficacy of regional anesthesia, intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel(R)) may provide extended pain relief following total joint arthroplasty.

 This has the potential to avoid the need for opioid medications.

 With better pain control, medication side effects can be avoided and patient's length of stay in the hospital can be shortened.

 Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus Standard Analgesia in Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether liposomal bupivacaine is effective in the management of pain following total joint arthroplasty, as compared to standard of care analgesia.
