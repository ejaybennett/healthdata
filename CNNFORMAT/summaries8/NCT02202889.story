(fifthQuint)Improving Bone Health in Adolescence Through Targeted Behavioral Intervention.

 A targeted behavioral intervention to improve calcium intake and bone mass was conducted at middle schools in 6 states.

 The primary outcomes of bone mass and dietary calcium were assessed among Asian, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white girls between 10 -13 y.

 Lactose maldigestion (LM) was determined by a breath hydrogen test (BHT).

 Perceived milk intolerance (PMI) and calcium intake were assessed by questionnaires and bone mineral content (BMC) was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

 Data from 473 girls were used in a multiple linear regression to examine the impact of the intervention while accounting for PMI and LM and adjusting for covariates.

School based educational intervention to educate on bone health among Hispanic, Asian or non-Hispanic white girls between 10-13 years with end points of knowledge gained, calcium intake and bone density in .

 The hypothesis was that the educational program would increase knowledge, improve dairy food and calcium consumption and enhance bone health in this population.

 A secondary hypothesis was that lactose maldigestion would be an impediment to improved dairy food consumption.
