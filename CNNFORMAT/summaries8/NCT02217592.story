 Causes and Factors Associated With Outcomes in Community-acquired Sepsis and Severe Sepsis in Northeast Thailand@highlight

This is an observational study to identify the aetiology and factors associated with outcome of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in Northeast Thailand.

 Potential study participants will be adult patients who are presented at the hospital with community-acquired sepsis.

 Clinical specimens (including blood, urine, sputum and throat swabs) will be collected from each participant on admission for culture, PCR and serological tests, and other laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers and genotyping.

 Participants' treatment will be closely monitored during the duration of their hospital stay.

 Blood will be again collected at 72 hours after admission.

 Participants will be contacted at 28 days after admission to determine clinical outcome by phone interview with standardized script.

 There will be a total of 5,020 patients enrolled in this study over 3 years.
