(fifthQuint)Impact of Pharmacotherapy Management in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.

 Dementia is characterized by memory loss associated with cognitive impairment, which directly interferes in learning process, social and professional performance, besides being the main cause of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD).

 In Brazil, patients are medicated for AD through "Programa de Medicamentos Excepcionais" (Exceptional Drug Program) that ensure the patients treatment by providing high cost medications.

 Even having access to, little is known about the effectiveness, safety and adherence of drug therapy in this group of patients.

 The research aims to promote adherence and develop strategies to address Drug-Related Problems (DRP's) in AD patients.

 For this end, we intend to conduct a descriptive, almost experimental and longitudinal uncontrolled research, from April 2014 to December 2015, at the CRIA: "Centro de Referencia do Idoso de Araraquara" (Reference Centre for the Elderly of Araraquara).

 Patients included in the research must have a diagnosis of AD and must be using drugs supplied by the "Programa de Medicamentos Excepcionais".

 For data collection pharmaceutical care will be employed as a technique, carried out through pharmaceutical meetings, including the steps of initial assessment, care plan (pharmaceutical intervention) and results evaluation.

 The results will be monitored for pharmacotherapy adherence, cognitive assessment and other clinical parameters related to their health problems and resolution of DRP's before and after the proposed follow-up.

The expected outcomes include knowledge of the medication experiences of AD patients, how they influence the adherence and other DRP's and how they can contribute by solving these problems, in addition to the impact evaluation of pharmaceutical care in cognitive improving and other clinical parameters monitored and evaluated individually.
