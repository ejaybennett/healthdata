(fifthQuint)Visual Quality Change of Eyes Implanted With Diffractive Multifocal Intraocular Lens After Cataract Surgery.

 50 eyes of 50 cataract patients scheduled for phacoemulsification surgery were recruited, the multifocal group (25 eyes) ,were implantation with Tecnis(R) ZMB00;and the monofocal group (25 eyes) were implantation with Tecnis(R) ZCB00.

 Methods: All eyes were examined by logMAR visual acuity chart and Optical quality analysis system (OQAS) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month,12 month after surgery for the subjective and objective visual quality Change during the first year.

 Measures:Subjective and objective visual quality were evaluated.

Tear-film quality dynamicswere evaluated.

In this study, the investigators examined the subjective visual quality including LogMAR uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA),uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA), distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) ,distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA),using logMAR visual acuity chart,and the objective visual quality including Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), Strehl ratio(SR), objective scatter index (OSI), OQAS value (OV),and the tear-film quality dynamics including the tear break-up time and the tear-film OSI between the eyes with multifocal lens and monofocal lenses by optical quality analysis system (OQAS).
