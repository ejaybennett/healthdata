(secondQuint)Clinical Study of Umbilical Cord Tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) for Treatment of Osteoarthritis.

 The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered to 40 patients with OA.

 Arm 1 will receive one intra-articular injection of UC-MSC into the knee and Arm 2 will receive IV UC-MSC once per day for 3 consecutive days.

 The primary objective of the trial is freedom from treatment associated adverse events at 3 and 12 months post treatment.

 Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at baseline, and 3 and 12 months post treatment and will be quantified based on the Western Ontario and McMaster osteoarthritis index (WOMAC).

Allogeneic human umbilical cord tissue-derived stem cells injected intravenously (IV) once per day for 3 days or once intra-articularly are a safe and will induce a therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis (OA) patients.
