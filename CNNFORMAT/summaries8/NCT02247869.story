(firstQuint)Dose-dense ABVD First Line Therapy in Early Stage Unfavorable Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

 Dose-density has been shown to be an important factor for complete remission rate and longterm survival in lymphomas.

 The aims of this study were to find out whether intensification of ABVD (dd-ABVD) is feasible and can improve the outcome of patients with early stage Hodgkin Lymphoma.

 In view of emerging data on the role of early PET in defining prognosis in Hodgkin Lymphoma patients, the percentage of FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) negativity after two cycle was chosen as the parameter to evaluate dd-ABVD activity.
