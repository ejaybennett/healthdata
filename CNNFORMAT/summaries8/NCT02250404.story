(fifthQuint)Molecular Signatures of Relapse in Tissue Samples From Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Receiving Cisplatin and Etoposide.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To collect and analyze small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) from 3 human patients before and after relapse to identify the molecular signatures of relapse.

 OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via RNA sequencing and DNA methylation at baseline.

 Patients also undergo collection of tissue samples for analysis at relapse.

 Molecular Signatures of Relapse in Tissue Samples From Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Receiving Cisplatin and Etoposide@highlight

This pilot research trial studies molecular signatures of the return of cancer after a period of improvement (relapse) in tissue samples from patients with small cell lung cancer who are receiving or planning to receive cisplatin and etoposide.

 Studying samples of tissue from patients with small cell lung cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer relapse.
