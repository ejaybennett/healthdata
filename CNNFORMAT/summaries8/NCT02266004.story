(firstQuint)Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Freezing of Gait.

 A randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study with an intervening washout period of 1 week will be performed to evaluate the effect of tDCS in conjunction with locomotor training (LT) in patients with PD.

 Order of tDCS and sham-tDCS will be randomized across subjects.

 Subjects with PD and FOG, will be randomly assigned to Group 1 (tDCS+LT - washout - sham-tDCS+LT) or Group 2 (sham-tDCS+LT - washout - tDCS+LT), with each washout period lasting 1 week.

 During each intervention session, subjects will receive the assigned tDCS ~or~ a sham-tDCS stimulation concomitant with LT.

 Kinematic data will be obtained using 3D motion capture as the subject walks along a 10-meter path.

 We will use single pulse TMS to evaluate the excitability of lower leg motor cortex.
