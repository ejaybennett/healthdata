(firstQuint)Postcath Radial Arterial Clamp Time In the CAth Lab.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of shorter radial artery clamp time post cardiac catheterization with respect to achieving hemostasis and the incidence of radial artery occlusion.

 The investigators hypothesize that shorter radial artery clamp times following cardiac catheterization will achieve similar hemostasis to longer clamp times with a decrease in the incidence of radial artery occlusion.

The investigators will assess the effect of different times of radial clamp post procedure on radial artery occlusion and bleeding.
