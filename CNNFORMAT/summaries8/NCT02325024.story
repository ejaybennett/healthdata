(fifthQuint)A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics Of Sativex in Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment or End Stage Renal Disease, Compared to Matched Subjects With Normal Renal Function.

.

 This is a Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of an oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex(R) (containing 10.

8 mg 9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD]) in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD (with a creatinine clearance 80 mL/min).

 Eligible subjects will be given a single oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex(R) on Dosing Day 1.

 Serial blood and urine samples for determination of concentrations of THC, 11-hydroxy- 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), CBD, and 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7- OH-CBD) will be collected from subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD, not requiring dialysis, and matched subjects with normal renal function before and up to 48 hours after dosing at selected time points.

 Pre-dose blood samples will also be collected for protein binding measurement.

 Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from Day -2 through to the post-study follow-up visit.

 The Follow-up Safety visit will be performed 7 days after Sativex(R) dosing (+ 2 days).

 The expected maximum duration for study participation (including Screening, Inpatient Period, and Follow-up) for each individual subject is a maximum of 24 days.

@highlight

The study aims to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oromucosal dose of Sativex(R) (i.

e.

 how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolises and excretes the drug) when subjects have severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD), compared with subjects who have normal renal function.

 The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be an effect from severe renal impairment on the PK of Sativex(R) when administered as a single oromucosal dose.

 The study additionally aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the same single oromucosal dose of Sativex(R) in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD.
