(fifthQuint)Survival and Recovery of Radio-labeled Platelets Derived From Mirasol-treated Whole Blood.

 The study will be a prospective, single-center, single-arm, intra-subject controlled, open-label design.

 Subjects will donate one unit of fresh whole blood.

 This unit will be treated with the Mirasol PRT System for whole blood and then stored for 24 hours 1 hour at 22 2C.

 At the end of storage, platelet concentrates will be separated from the unit according to the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) procedures.

 An aliquot will be removed from the platelet concentrates for testing and for radiolabeling and reinfusion.

 The platelets in Mirasol-treated whole blood will be tested for key in vitro parameters directly after treatment (Day 0) and at the end of storage (Day 1).

 Sterility testing will also be conducted on the stored units.

 An aliquot of the platelet concentrate separated from each unit of stored Mirasol-treated whole blood will be radiolabeled with either 111Indium Oxine or 51Chromium, and autologously infused.

 An intra-subject control will be utilized as per the BEST guidelines for platelet radiolabeling procedures.

 On the day of infusion, the subject will donate a fresh sample of whole blood.

 Platelets will be separated from this fresh sample and labeled with the radio-isotope that was not used to label the subject's Mirasol-treated platelet sample.

 The two radiolabeled platelet aliquots (Mirasol-treated and fresh control) will be infused simultaneously, and the recovery and survival of the two types of platelets will be measured according to standard institutional practice.

 Survival and Recovery of Radio-labeled Platelets Derived From Mirasol-treated Whole Blood@highlight

A total of twelve healthy volunteers will donate one unit of fresh whole blood.

 This unit will be treated with the Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology for Whole blood and then stored for 24h.

 At the end of storage, platelet concentrates will be separated from the unit, tested for key in vitro parameters and radiolabeled.

 On the same day (so 24h after the donation of whole blood), the volunteer will donate a fresh sample of whole blood.

 Platelets will be separated from this fresh sample and labeled with another radio-isotope.

 Then, the two radiolabeled platelet aliquots will be infused simultaneously and the recovery and survival of the two types of platelets will be measured.
