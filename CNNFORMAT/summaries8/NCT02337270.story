(thirdQuint)Phase 1 Clinical Trial of the Safety and Immunogenicity of an Adenovirus-based TB Vaccine Administered by Aerosol.

 This is a phase 1, open label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single administration of escalating doses of a recombinant replication deficient human adenoviral (Ad5) TB vaccine containing the immunodominant antigen Ag85A delivered to the respiratory tract by aerosol in healthy volunteers with a history of BCG immunization.

 36 healthy volunteers will be enrolled and administered escalating doses of vaccine using the AeroNeb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer.

 At the highest dose, participants will be randomized to inhaled or intramuscular administration.

 Cellular immune responses in the lung and peripheral blood will be evaluated.

This is a phase 1 study, in healthy volunteers who have previously been immunized with bacilli Calmette Guerin (BCG), to evaluate the safety and immune responses that develop in the blood and lungs following the administration by aerosol of a new experimental adenovirus-based vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), Ad5Ag85A.
