(secondQuint)Fatty Liver Study in Patients With Type II Diabetes.

 In patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control is not accomplished with Metformin alone, there are several options for additional hypoglycemic agent.

 As per recent National guidelines at least three "second line" agents can be added to metformin: thiazolidinediones, Lantus insulin, and DPP4 inhibitors.

 All three approaches have been proven to help accomplishing goals of therapy for glycemic control (HbA1c7.

6%) and fatty liver (presence of "bright" liver in abdominal ultrasound).

 The primary objective of this trial is to measure changes in hepatic lipid content using three common alternative therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not controlled with metformin alone.
