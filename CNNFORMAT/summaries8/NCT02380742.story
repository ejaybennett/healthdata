(secondQuint)Topical Anesthetic Use In Pessary Management.

 Lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA 5%) cream has been shown to be effective in reducing pain during minor gynecologic procedures.

 The primary objective of this trial is to determine if the use of 5% EMLA cream at the time of pessary removal and insertion reduces pain when compared to the use of placebo cream.

 Participants will be randomized to receive either 10 grams of 5% EMLA cream (4 mL) or 4 mL of placebo cream (aqueous cream BP).

 Cream will be applied in office at the time of pessary removal and insertion.
