(firstQuint)A Phase 1, 2-Part, Single Ascending Dose Assessment of the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Rolapitant Intravenous in Healthy Volunteers.

 Part 1 of the study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a SAD, up to 6 cohorts,of rolapitant IV (2 mg/mL solution) administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.

 In Part 2 of the study, the safety and tolerability of the highest safe and well-tolerated dose established in Part 1 will be evaluated in an expanded cohort.

 The highest safe and well-tolerated dose established in Part 1 will be ascertained by the following criteria: an upper limit of 90% confidence interval (CI) for Cmax.

 A minimum of 40 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2.
