(fifthQuint)Effects of Raltegravir Based Regimen on Platelet Reactivity, Platelet-monocyte Aggregation and Immune Activation.

 Rationale: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals.

 The precise mechanisms underlying this increased cardiovascular risk remain to be elucidated .

 Platelet hyperreactivity and increased platelet-monocyte aggregation (PMA) are found in HIV-infected patients and may contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk as platelets play a key role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and in acute cardiovascular events.

 In addition, HIV-infected individuals frequently suffer from persistent immune activation and inflammation.

 In a cross-sectional study the investigators recently showed that individuals using a regimen containing the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have reduced platelet hyperreactivity and PMA compared to other antiretroviral regimens.

 Other recent studies showed that raltegravir is associated with decreased immune activation.

 Due to the inherent limitations of cross sectional studies, the investigators aim to expand our findings in an intervention study.

 Objective: Investigate whether switch from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen to a raltegravir-based regimen results in reduced platelet reactivity, reduced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and pro-inflammatory status of monocytes.

 Study design: Investigator initiated, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial in HIV-infected patients using a NNRTI- or PI-based regimen.

 Study population: Adult HIV-infected study participants with undetectable (IIb3) upon stimulation with different platelet agonists.

 Secondary parameters: 1.

 Platelet-leukocyte aggregates (eg.

 PMA).

 2.

 Activation markers on T cells and monocytes.

 3.

 Soluble (plasma) markers of platelet and monocyte activation.

 Due to the inherent limitations of cross sectional studies, the investigators aim to expand our findings in an intervention study.

 The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial where the investigators switch patients to a integrase containing treatment regimen to assay possible changes in platelet function and persistent immune activation.

 Knowledge gathered in the proposed study can help understand and prevent cardiovascular disease in patients treated for a HIV infection by reducing platelet hyperreactivity and persistent immune activation.
