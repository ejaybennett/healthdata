(fifthQuint)A Phase II Trila of Sunitinib Schedule 4/2 vs.

 Shedule 2/1 as First Line Therapy in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

.

 Sunitinib given at 50 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) is the standard care for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the schedule was reported with a high rate of dose reduction and dose discontinuation because of the safety profile.

 Sunitinib 50mg/day on schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment, 1 weeks off) was reported to be associated with significantly decrease toxicities in patients who initially experienced grade 3 or greater toxicity on the schedule 4/2 and could extend treatment duration considerably.

 Through this research, we would like to explore whether the schedule 2/1 of sunitinib 50 mg/day as first line therapy could provide the same efficacy as standard schedule 4/2 in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and overall survival, while reducing drug-related toxicity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.

Sunitinib given at 50 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) is the standard care for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the schedule was reported with a high rate of dose reduction and dose discontinuation because of the safety profile.

 So investigators conducte this randomized, multi-center phase II study to determine whether a sunitinib regimen of 50 mg/day 2-weeks on/1-week off could provide the same efficacy in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and overall survival, while reducing drug-related toxicity.
