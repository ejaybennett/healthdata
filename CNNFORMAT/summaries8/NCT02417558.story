(fifthQuint)Cognitive/Physical Computer-Game Blended Training With Personalized Brain Network Activation Technology for the Elderly.

 Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in brain activity associated with elderly in risk of dementia.

 Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function.

 The ERPs provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited.

 However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is improved significantly.

 The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of a Personalized Brain Network Activation (PBNA) test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain functional connectivity associated with minor neurocognitive disorder) in early dementia management.

 The study is conducted in 4 sites: Switzerland, Germany, USA and Greece.

 It uses a pre-post-test design with the between-participant factor group [intervention(s) vs.

 passive and/or active control].

 Post-test will be conducted within 2 weeks after completion of the exercise period.

 Interventions will be carried out within day care centres, hospitals, senior care centres, a memory outpatient centre, local parishes, and at participants' homes.

 Centres will provide 8-12 exercise weeks per year for 3 years, with a frequency of at least 3 "Alterniity AR" sessions per week, resulting in at least 24-36 intervention sessions each year of the study.

 The closed feedback loop with a direct PBNA test is basically divided to 3 phases - first EEG data is collected from subjects using a portable EEG system while the participants are performing the "Alterniity AR" intervention.

 The EEG data is then analysed offline.

 Finally, the "Alterniity AR" exercise type, configuration and difficulty level is updated based on the analysed data.

 A similar trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier: NCT02313935.

 Cognitive/Physical Computer-Game Blended Training With Personalized Brain Network Activation Technology for the Elderly@highlight

The study involves a novel Virtual Reality Interface that offers full-body immersion "Alterniity AR" and more specifically computer exercises blended with game activities.

 It was hypothesized that "Alterniity AR" facilitated, game blended cognitive and/or physical exercise improves global cognition when compared to control groups; moreover, these improvements may be manifested by brain activity changes.

 The investigators explore here the impact of potential moderators on combined exercise-induced cognitive benefits, as well as, individual/separate training schemes.

 In addition, the proposed study will provide Alterniity AR" in a closed feedback loop with a direct, reliable, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in brain activity associated with elderly in risk of dementia.

 The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization.
