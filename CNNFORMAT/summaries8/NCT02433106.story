(thirdQuint)The Effects of an Exercise Programme on Neuromuscular Outcomes in Gaelic Sport.

 Gaelic football and hurling, a stick and ball game, are Irish amateur games components of explosiveness with the multi-directional nature of both games, in addition to the overhead activities and the high level of contact involved; makes it a high risk of injury, especially during match-play.

 Recent systematic reviews found that injury prevention exercise programmes can significantly reduce the relative risk of lower extremity injuries.

 Several studies have successfully incorporated exercise components including balance, plyometrics, strength, neuromuscular training, running and cutting movement patterns to prevent injuries in sports such as soccer, basketball, and handball.

 This study examines the effect of an injury prevention programme on 2 recognized risk factors for lower limb injury balance and jump landing mechanics.
