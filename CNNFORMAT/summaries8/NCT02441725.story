(secondQuint)Validation of the 1-minute Sit-to-stand Test in Patients With COPD.

 Exercise capacity is a strong predictor for mortality, exacerbations and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

 The 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-min STS test) is a promising exercise capacity test that is simple to conduct and requires few resources.

 This study will provide an in-depth validation of the 1-min STS test, specifically evaluating the tests reliability, validity, responsiveness to change and minimal clinically important difference.

 The study will also assess the predictive properties of the 1-min STS test with regards to detecting exacerbations, as well as identify patterns of physical activity and patient-reported symptoms of exacerbations.
