(secondQuint)Linagliptin and Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Pilot Study.

 This study is a 13-week, open-label study of 8 participants with schizophrenia and minimal thought disorder; they will have 12 weeks of treatment and week for assessment.

 They will receive linagliptin, 5 mg by mouth once per day, while continuing their antipsychotic treatment.

 The principal outcome measures will be the concentrations of the long and short forms of SDF1- (stromal cell-derived factor alpha) in blood.

 Linagliptin and Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Pilot Study@highlight

The purpose of the present study is to gather pilot data on the effects of linagliptin on the concentration of the long and short forms of SDF1- (stromal cell-derived factor alpha) in humans, and to demonstrate the feasibility of such a study in patients with psychosis in our setting.
