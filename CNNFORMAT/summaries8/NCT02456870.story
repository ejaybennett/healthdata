(thirdQuint)Expandability of Aging Adipose Tissue.

 This pilot study will begin to address whether adipose tissue biology changes with advancing age.

 Specifically, we will test whether adipose tissue loses some of its ability to expand in response to overfeeding in older compared to younger men.

 To test this possibility the Investigators will recruit overweight and mildly obese older (age 55-75y) and younger (age 25-40y) men and collect adipose tissue biopsies before and after 7 days of overfeeding.

 The investigators will test how well the cells in adipose tissue expand in response to overfeeding and whether this differs between younger and older men.

 Expandability of Aging Adipose Tissue@highlight

The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether adipose tissue loses some of its ability to expand in response to overfeeding in older compared to younger men.

 The investigators hypothesize that the adipose tissue response to overfeeding may be weakened in older when compared to younger men, thereby leading to worsened ectopic storage depots for older men.
