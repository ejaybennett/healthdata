(firstQuint)Genomic and Proteomic Profiling Targets Influenced Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer.

 To explore the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer suggested by proteomic and genomic profiling using RPMA, targeted resequencing, IHC analysis, WGS, RNA-seq, and Exome sequencing on progression-free survival.

 When a molecular target cannot be identified, the patient will be treated with a therapy selected on an empirical basis by the investigator/treating physician at the individual site and will be followed for survival status.

 Only available, FDA-approved agents will be used.
