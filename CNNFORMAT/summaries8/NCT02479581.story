(thirdQuint)The Safety and Efficacy of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS)Applied on Cardiac Surgery With Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

 Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or fast-track surgery is a perioperative and postoperative care concept initiated in the early 1990s aiming to reduce the length of hospital stays following elective abdominal surgery.

 The success of ERAS depends highly on multidisciplinary teamwork and patient compliance.

 This study intends to compare the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept applied to patients with heart valve disease undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass under traditional perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's physical and psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery, in order to establish an effective perioperative management during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation safely.
