(fifthQuint)Feasibility and Dose Tolerability of HD-tDCS in Healthy Adults and Adults With Down Syndrome.

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method which enables noninvasive electrical stimulation of the cortex via electrodes placed on the subject's skull.

 tDCS has been shown to improve motor learning, visuomotor coordination, probabilistic classification, boost memory in humans and was found to be well tolerated in children with early onset schizophrenia, continuous spike-wave in sleep (CSWS), refractory epilepsy and dystonia.

 The method has been approved for investigational purposes by the FDA.

 High definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) allows for precise generation of electrical fields over selected cortical areas using multiple electrodes.

 Positioning of the stimulating electrodes is determined with the help of MR brain images and appropriate modeling.

 The purpose of this pilot trial is to study feasibility, tolerability, and safety of HD-tDCS administered daily for a total of 20 sessions.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I: To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in healthy adult subjects; Part I will be defined to be positive if 5 healthy adults are accrued within the study period (12 months) and at least 4 of 5 participants have successful completion.

 Tolerability will be measured as the proportion of subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6 weeks.

 Part II: After review of the safety data for Part I is completed and reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB, Part II will be initiated.

 To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in adult subjects with Down Syndrome; Part II will be defined to be positive if 5 adults with Down Syndrome are accrued within the study period (12 months) and at least 4 of 5 participants have successful completion.

 Tolerability will be measured as the proportion of subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6 weeks.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Part I: - Collect pilot data on safety of HD-tDCS in healthy adults, where safety is defined by incidents of adverse events.

 Safety outcomes will include vital signs, physical/neurologic exam findings, weight, electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms.

 - Collect pilot data on feasibility of efficacy endpoints.

 These will include assessment of impact of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions, on EEG amplitudes and coherences in the lower (9Hz) frequency ranges and coherences in the lower (9Hz) frequency ranges and coherences in the lower (<8Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges in adults with Down Syndrome.
