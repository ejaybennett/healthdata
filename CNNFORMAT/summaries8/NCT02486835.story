(fifthQuint)Efficacy & Tolerability of a Specific Plantain,Thyme and Honey Cough Syrup vs Placebo in Child Cough Due to Common Cold.

 Cough is a life saving reflex, therefore it is important, especially in pediatrics, to calm cough spells without sedating the reflex.

 Looking into mechanisms for cough management different from mucolytics, or sedatives, such as protection of irritated pharynx mucosa from post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically sound and shows practical interesting results.

 A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such protective mechanism (acting through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural substances (honey, plantago lanceolata and thymus vulgaris) and placebo has not been done so far, in very young children, especially in a time frame of 4 days.

 The intent of this study is to use the protective syrup versus placebo in children with moderate to severe night and daily cough, measured with a validated parent questionnaire.

 The degree of disturbance of cough is followed immediately after one night administration of the study products and daily for 4 nights, 3 days.

 Assessment of effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to placebo is considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy.
