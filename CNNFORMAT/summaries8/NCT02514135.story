(secondQuint)Intra-abdominal Hypertension in Critically Ill Patients.

 Increased pressure within the abdominal cavity is particularly common in intensive care patients and has been shown to be an independent risk-factor for mortality in this patient population.

 The quoted rates of intra-abdominal hypertension of range anywhere from 20-60% are dependent on the population of patient studied.

 The prospective observational studies performed to date have been underpowered, used strict inclusion/exclusion criteria or were performed prior to consensus guidelines on the definition and measurement of intra-abdominal pressure and hypertension.
