(secondQuint)Repeatability and Reproducibility of the ArcScan Insight 100 VHF Digital Ultrasound.

 Very high-frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound was first used in 1993 to obtain images of the cornea (the window at the front of the eye) and anterior segment (the space behind the cornea including the iris and the lens).

 A commercially available instrument, called the Artemis 2, has been used in routine clinical practice since 2001.

 The Artemis 2 was CE approved as well as having FDA approval (the US equivalent of the CE mark).

 The ArcScan Insight 100 VHF digital ultrasound scanner is a new instrument so does not yet have a CE mark.

 However, the ArcScan Insight 100 is an upgraded version of the Artemis 2, so any differences are improvements to components, but the measurement method remains essentially the same.

 The aim of the study is to establish the repeatability (i.

e.

 the variability in measurements taken by a single examiner during a single visit) and reproducibility (i.

e.

 the variability in measurements taken in the same conditions between two examiners) of the ArcScan Insight 100 device for measuring corneal and anterior segment parameters.

 Repeatability and Reproducibility of the ArcScan Insight 100 VHF Digital Ultrasound@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of corneal (including corneal, epithelial, stromal, and LASIK flap thickness) and anterior segment measurements using the ArcScan Insight 100 very high-frequency digital ultrasound arc-scanner.
