 Participants who received treatment with namilumab in the previous study M1-1188-002-EM (PRIORA [NCT01317797]) will have two whole blood samples (3 mL each) collected to correlate genetic markers with namilumab treatment responses as determined in the previous study.

 The study will enroll approximately 14 participants who received namilumab in the previous study.

 cent No intervention is administered in this study.

 This trial will be conducted in Bulgaria, Spain and The Netherlands.
