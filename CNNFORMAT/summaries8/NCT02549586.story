(fifthQuint)Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Allogeneic Organ Transplant Tolerance.

 Although short-term results for liver transplantation are excellent, the need for immunosuppression limits quality of life and long-term survival.

 Investigators plan to examine the utility and safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to allow withdrawal of immunosuppression in 10 liver transplant recipients who are at a high risk of developing recurrent liver damage from repeated bouts of rejection, or recurrent disease or who have a high likelihood of developing serious medical complications from complications of immune suppression.

 Hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized, purified and cryopreserved.

 Following a chemotherapy and Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) based-regimen for immune ablation, the purified stem cells will be thawed and infused back into participants (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant - HSCT).

 Participants will be converted to everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi), which will be continued for 6 months and then withdrawn based on histologic evidence of graft acceptance.

 Participants will be followed closely for a total of 24 months for any biochemical and histologic evidence of tolerance or rejection.

 Re-vaccination to common viral and bacterial antigens will be undertaken as required using a standard protocol for recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

This open-label, proof-of-principle two center cohort study will evaluate the ability of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to induce tolerance in recipients of deceased or live donor liver transplants (ASCOTT).

 A maximum of 10 participants will be entered at a minimum of 3 months post liver transplant.

 The participants will undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) to "re-educate" their immune systems to accept the graft without the need for long term immunosuppression (tolerance).
