(fifthQuint)GeneMatch: A Program of the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry to Match Individuals to Studies Based on Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotype.

 The primary objectives of the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry GeneMatch program are to (1) identify and characterize a large cohort of people who are interested in, and may be eligible to participate in, current and future preclinical Alzheimer's disease research studies and clinical trials based on their genetic background, and (2) provide information to these individuals about research studies for which they may be eligible, based in part on their genetic background.

 Cognitively unimpaired individuals age 55 to 75, inclusive, are eligible to enroll in GeneMatch.

 GeneMatch will provide participants with a genetic sample kit (a cheek swab) to test for a specific gene called apolipoproteins E (APOE).

 GeneMatch does not disclose the results of the APOE test to participants.

 GeneMatch may use the APOE test results to match participants to research studies.

 Participants are under no obligation to pursue these study opportunities.

The purpose of the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry GeneMatch program is to identify a large group of people interested in participating in research studies or clinical trials based in part on their genetic background.

 This genetic information will be used to match interested individuals to studies, providing a recruitment resource to the Alzheimer's scientific community.
