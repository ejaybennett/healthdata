(fifthQuint)I-gel Versus C-LMA as a Conduit for Tracheal Intubation Using Ventilating Bougie.

 SGAs have been used as a conduit for tracheal intubation using ventilating bougie.

 Patients were anaesthetised with intravenous induction agent, non-depolarising muscle relaxant and then SGAs were inserted.

 Two groups were compared.

 In group I : I-gel was inserted, its position was confirmed and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it.

 It's position was confirmed, then I-gel was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie and it's position was confirmed.

 In group C : C-LMA was inserted, its position was confirmed and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it.

 It's position was confirmed, then C-LMA was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie and it's position was confirmed.

Supraglottic Airway devices(SGAs) like I-Gel and C-LMA ( classic laryngeal mask airway ) have been used as a conduit for tracheal intubation using ventilating bougie.

 General Anaesthesia with tracheal intubation is one of the technique for giving anaesthesia.

 Tracheal intubation may become difficult sometimes and endangers patients life.

 Using SGAs as a conduit for tracheal intubation helps in securing airway.

 This will be further facilitated by using ventilating bougie, as it maintains oxygenation.
