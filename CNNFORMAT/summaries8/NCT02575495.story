(secondQuint)A Randomized Control Trial of Antibiotic Treatment Duration For Asymptomatic Bacteriuria After Kidney Transplantation.

 Introduction: Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common practice in renal transplant centers leading to prolong exposure of antimicrobial agents with long hospital length of stay.

 The duration of antibiotics treatment in this condition have never been proposed.

 Objective: To evaluate the proper duration of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria early (less than 1 month) after kidney transplantation Method: This is a prospective, randomized, open labeled, single center study using intention to treat analysis.

 Patients will be identified and after informed consent is obtained, will be randomized to receive 7 or 14 days course of antibiotics.

The major hypothesis to be tested is that there was no difference in the clinical outcome between 7(short-course) and 14(traditional-course) days of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria early after kidney transplantation.
