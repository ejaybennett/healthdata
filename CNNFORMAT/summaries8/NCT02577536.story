(fifthQuint)PregSource: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy.

 The objective of PregSource: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy (PregSource) is: to better understand the range of physical and emotional experiences and alterations in behavior that women have during pregnancy and after giving birth, the impact of these experiences on women's lives, and the perinatal challenges encountered by special sub-populations of women.

 PregSource uses a longitudinal, crowd-sourcing, citizen science approach, asking pregnant women regularly and directly about their pregnancies.

 Participants enter information throughout gestation and the early infancy of their babies into online surveys and trackers via a website and/or mobile application ("app").

 In exchange, participants will be able to track their pregnancy data over time, print out reports to share with their healthcare team, and view summaries of de-identified data to see how they compare to other women.

 In addition, PregSource will provide participants with links to trusted, evidence-based information from partner organizations about pregnancy management, issues, and complications.

 Participants may also be a potential pool of recruits for clinical studies.

 Based on information they enter, eligible women who are interested in participating in clinical studies may be sent contact information about observational or interventional studies.

 Their contact information will not be shared directly with researchers.

 After a critical mass of data is collected, de-identified data will be available to approved researchers for analysis.
