(firstQuint)Improving Outcomes in Cleft Palate Surgery.

 This study will determine whether a surgeon-directed audit and feedback intervention reduces rates of oro-nasal fistula after cleft palate repair.

 Fistula is an important potential complication of cleft palate repair.

 The study also evaluates feasibility of standardized outcome measurement in the care of children with cleft lip and palate, acceptability of standardized measurement, and acceptability of the audit and feedback intervention among surgeons.

 The results of this research will improve child health by enabling cleft surgeons to critically evaluate and improve their patient's outcomes.
