(secondQuint)A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of LAM-002A In Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (LAM-002A/NHL).

 LAM-002A is supplied as 25-mg or 50-mg capsules and will be administered two times daily or three times daily by mouth in repeated 28-day cycles.

 Patients will be advised to take the doses at the same time each day.

 A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients (i.

e.

, < 33%) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose cohort.

 Once the dose and schedule are established, additional patients will be treated to better characterize the safety, tolerability,PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity of LAM-002A when administered alone or in combination with rituximab or atezolizumab.

 A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of LAM-002A In Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (LAM-002A/NHL)@highlight

This is a Phase 1 dose-exploration study of LAM-002A administered by mouth in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.

 Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),and preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated.
