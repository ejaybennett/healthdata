(thirdQuint)Safety and Efficacy Trial of AAV Gene Therapy in Patients With CNGB3 Achromatopsia.

 This will be a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 study of the safety and efficacy of rAAV2tYF-PR1.

7-hCNGB3 administered to one eye by subretinal injection in individuals with achromatopsia caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene.

 The primary study endpoint will be safety and the secondary study endpoint will be efficacy.

 Subjects will be enrolled sequentially in four groups.

 Subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 3 will be at least 18 years of age and will receive a lower, middle or higher dose of study agent.

 Subjects in Group 4 will be at least 6 years of age and will receive the maximum tolerated dose identified in Groups 1, 2 and 3.

 Safety will be monitored by evaluation of ocular and non ocular adverse events and hematology and clinical chemistry parameters.

 Efficacy parameters will include visual acuity, light discomfort testing, color vision, static visual field, ERG, adaptive optics retinal imaging and OCT.
