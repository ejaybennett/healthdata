(thirdQuint)18F-fluoride (18F-NaF) PET for Identifying Coronary Atherosclerotic Plaques.

 This research involves having cardiac 18F-NaF PET imaging of the heart and coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) in a one-day visit.

 Three groups of patients will be enrolled: patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome, patients with stable ischemic heart disease, and asymptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

 Prior to 18F-NaF administration, participants will have blood drawn to measure serum creatinine and other biomarkers related to heart disease.

 All participants will undergo a 18F-NaF PET scan and a coronary CTA (which includes contrast administration).

 If medically appropriate, participants will have oral or intravenous beta-blocker (metoprolol) and nitroglycerin prior to CTA imaging.

 Up to 10 patients will be asked to return for repeat18F-NaF PET and coronary CTA imaging 2 to 21 days after the initial scan.

 Up to 20 patients will be asked to return for repeat 18F-NaF PET scan and coronary CTA imaging about 6 months after the initial scan.

 Researchers will compare the repeat images to the initial studies.

 18F-fluoride (18F-NaF) PET for Identifying Coronary Atherosclerotic Plaques@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether 18F-NaF (sodium fluoride) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans can be used to identify ruptured and high-risk plaque as compared to non-invasive coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scans and high-definition intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

 In subsets of patients, 18F-NaF PET scans and CCTA will be repeated to assess scan-rescan reproducibility.
