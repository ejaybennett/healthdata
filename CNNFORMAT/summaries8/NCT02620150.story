(fifthQuint)SSRI Effects on Depression and Immunity in HIV/AIDS.

 To pursue our long-term objective of successfully treating co-morbid mental and medical disorders in HIV/AIDS, this study aims to determine whether: 1) SSRI treatment significantly increases innate immunity and decreases chronic inflammation and immune activation, and 2) changes in depressive symptoms correlate with changes in immunity in HIV/AIDS.

 HIV-seropositive, depressed subjects will be randomized to 10 weeks of double blind therapy with either escitalopram or placebo.

 All participants will concurrently begin CCBT (Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) using the program Good Days Ahead.

 Subject visits will occur weekly for the first 6 weeks and then at weeks 8 and 10.

 The treating clinician will assess side effects, review symptomatic progress, and adjust the study medication as clinically appropriate.

 An independent clinical evaluator will assess patients at baseline, and weeks 1-6, 8 and 10.

 Blood samples collected at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 10 will be used to assay markers of innate immune suppression (lytic units of NK cells, LUNK, and intracellular IFN gamma in NK cells) and markers of inflammation (IL-6 and C-Reactive Protein).

 At the end of the 10-week treatment phase, all participants will be referred for appropriate clinical treatment of their depression.

 SSRI Effects on Depression and Immunity in HIV/AIDS@highlight

This is a 10 week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) effects for treatment of depression in HIV/AIDS with a focus on innate immunity and inflammation.

 Depressed population is HIV + on cART, not currently on treatment for depression.

 Subjects will complete cognitive behavior therapy, CCBT for their depression.

 Blood samples collected for virologic, neuroendocrine, and immunologic evaluation.

 Our overarching hypothesis is that SSRI treatment of depression and improvement of depressive symptoms leads to increased innate immunity and decreased inflammation, resulting in better control of HIV disease and decreased morbidity.
