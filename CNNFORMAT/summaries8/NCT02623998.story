(thirdQuint)Remission Evaluation of a Metabolic Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes With Sitagliptin (REMIT-Sita).

 This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in 100 patients with recently-diagnosed T2DM.

 Participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: (a) a 12-week course of treatment with sitagliptin, metformin, insulin glargine and lifestyle therapy, or (b) standard diabetes therapy, and followed for a total of 64 weeks (1 year and 3 months).

 In all participants with HbA1C 7.

3% at this visit or who meet criteria for hyperglycemic relapse after stopping drugs will receive standard glycemic management as informed by the current Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines.

 Remission Evaluation of a Metabolic Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes With Sitagliptin (REMIT-Sita)@highlight

The purpose of the study is to determine whether in patients with early type 2 diabetes,a short-term intensive metabolic intervention comprising of sitagliptin, metformin, basal insulin glargine and lifestyle approaches will be superior to standard diabetes therapy in achieving sustained diabetes remission.
