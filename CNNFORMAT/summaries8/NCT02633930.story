(fifthQuint)Helicobacter Pylori Eradication With Berberine Quadruple Therapy Versus Clarithromycin Quadruple Therapy.

 The study will include three phases: screening, treatment and follow-up.

 Screening: this phase will last a maximum of 28 days and subjects eligibility will be evaluated after informed consent signature.

 Endoscopy and Urea Breath test will be performed in addition to the baseline routine evaluations.

 Treatment: Subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and will be treated for 14 days.

 A randomization visit will take place on Day 0 and an end-of-treatment visit will take place between day 12 and 14.

 Follow-up: includes two visits.

 approximately 14 days of treatment and 28 days after the end of treatment.

 Eradication of H.

 Pylori will be confirmed through urea breath test(UBT).

 Helicobacter Pylori Eradication With Berberine Quadruple Therapy Versus Clarithromycin Quadruple Therapy@highlight

This study aims at evaluating efficacy and safety of berberine-containing quadruple therapy(berberine, lansoprazole, bismuth and amoxicillin) versus clarithromycin-containing quadruple therapy (clarithromycin,lansoprazole, bismuth and amoxicillin) in H.

 pylori eradication.

 It is hypothesized that berberine-containing quadruple therapy is non-inferior to clarithromycin-containing quadruple therapy.

 Patients with confirmed H.

 pylori positive status will be randomized to one of the treatments described above.

 At week 2 and 6 follow-up visits, a urea breath test(UBT) will be performed to confirm eradication.
