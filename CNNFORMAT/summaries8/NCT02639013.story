 This measurement can guide patient management.

 Monitoring intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal per-fusion pressure.

 for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome has become an inexpensive and useful diagnostics tool for identifying complications.

 An integrated approach to screening and monitoring for intra-abdominal hypertension may improve patient outcomes and decrease hospital costs.

 Due to the high incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, it is essential for critical care nurses to regularly monitor intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal per-fusion pressure.

 Critical care nurses have the ability to identify intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, implement and evaluate management interventions.

 Nursing practice should be centered on evidence based practice guidelines .

 Nurses should provide a standard of care in managing patients who are at risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome from pre hospital, emergency, operating room and intensive care areas.
