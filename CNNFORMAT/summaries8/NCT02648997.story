(firstQuint)A Study of Nivolumab in Adult Participants With Recurrent High-Grade Meningioma.

 This research is a Phase II clinical trial, which means it will test the safety and effectiveness of Nivolumab.

 Nivolumab is an antibody (type of human protein) that works to stop tumor cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy.

 Immunotherapy is trying to have the body's own immune system work against tumor cells.

 Nivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this intervention may help to stop Meningioma cells from growing.

 Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat other types of cancers, but the FDA (the U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for this type of cancer.
