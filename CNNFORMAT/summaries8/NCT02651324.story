(secondQuint)Efficacy of Ketamine for Improvement in Postoperative Pain Control After Spinal Fusion for Idiopathic Scoliosis.

 After consenting, patients will be randomized by the pharmacy.

 In the operating room patients will receive ketamine/placebo 0.

5mg/kg bolus prior to the surgical incision, followed by ketamine/placebo 0.

2mg/kg continuous infusion up to 48hours.

 All the patients will also receive 15mg/k IV acetaminophen at the end of the surgery, followed by every 6hr for 48hrs.

 Rest of the pain regimen will be the usual post-operative pain management for spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis, which includes morphine PCA, IV ketorolac from POD 1, and flexaril from POD 1.

 All the patients and parents will fill out a survey at 0hr, 24hr and 48hr grading their level of satisfaction with the post-operative pain.
