(fifthQuint)Trial on the Impact of Technical Anesthetic in Pregnancies With Intrauterine Growth Restriction.

 INTRODUCTION: The combined spinal-epidural analgesia during labor has been associated with changes in fetal heart rate.

 Opinions in the literature are not fully consolidated, and some publications have failed to show a significant increase in fetal bradycardia following the combination lock.

 In addition, the question remains whether these changes found may modify the perinatal outcome in pregnancies that occur with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), since there are no studies comparing the techniques in this population.

 OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of combined spinal-epidural analgesia and epidural analgesia isolated on uterine basal tone and its association with the occurrence of changes in fetal heart rate on perinatal outcome in patients with fetuses with IUGR.

 METHOD: This is experimental, analytical, prospective, randomized, double-blind.

 It will include 74 pregnant women with gestations occurring with IUGR or chronic uteroplacental insufficiency of any etiology, that are still admitted to labor.

 Pregnant women will be randomly divided into two groups: combined spinal-epidural analgesia and epidural analgesia alone.

 The primary dependent variables to be evaluated will be the change in uterine tone and changes in the fetal heart rate.

The combined spinal-epidural analgesia during the labor has been associated with changes in fetal heart rate, which the opinions in literature are not fully consolidated and some studies have failed to show an increase significant fetal bradycardia following the combination lock.

 In addition, it's not clear that these changes found may modify the perinatal outcome in pregnancies who attend with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), since there are no studies comparing the techniques in this population.
