 Study SL-801-0115 is a first-in-human, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced (i.

e.

, metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable) solid tumors that are resistant to or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy or for which there is no standard systemic therapy and additional radiation therapy or other loco-regional therapies are not considered feasible.

 Eligible patients will be enrolled and receive treatment with SL-801 in a 21-day cycle.

 SL-801 will be administered orally and the dose regimen will depend on the cohort in which the patient is enrolled.

 The study plans to enroll 40-50 adult patients at multiple study centers in the US.
