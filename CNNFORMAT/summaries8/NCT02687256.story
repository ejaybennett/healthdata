(firstQuint)Evaluation of Extended Infusion Set Wear Using Medtronic Extended Wear Sof-set Infusion Set.

 This is a double blinded cross-over study.

 Subjects will be asked to wear infusion set either a standard infusion set or an extended wear infusion set.

 They will wear each infusion set twice, and the order of infusion set wear will be randomized with the first infusion set wear and then alternated over 4 weeks.

 By performing a cross over study using both experimental infusion sets and standard infusion sets, the investigators hope to see whether there is a benefit to using an extended wear infusion set.
