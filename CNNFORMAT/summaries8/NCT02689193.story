(fifthQuint)IDIS Project Work Package 2: Establishing a Biobank at ITM and Collaborating Centres.

 The aim of the project is the identification of Salmonella specific proteins that can be detected in samples derived from the host (= humans) during an acute infection.

 This can support the development of rapid tests to improve the diagnosis of invasive Salmonellosis.

 The study is taking place at the travel clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, and at the Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

 It is planned to start in 2016 at the Centre Hospitalier de Kingasani in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo in collaboration with the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

 The expected number of participants in total is 2500.

 Patients (children and/or adults) presenting with (a history of) fever are asked permission (informed consent and/or assent) to draw additional blood samples (along with routine care samples, so no need for additional venipuncture), and for the long term storage of these samples (whole blood and plasma) in a freezer together with left-over serum and urine samples.

 They are also asked permission for the collection of coded data including basic demographic, clinical and laboratory data.

 Blood for plasma and urine are centrifugated.

 All samples are aliquoted into cryotubes (coded labelling) before storage in a -80 C freezer.

 Depending on the final diagnosis, patients can be divided in 4 groups: 1.

 Patients for whom blood cultures grew Salmonella species 2.

 Patients for whom blood cultures did not grow a pathogen 3.

 Patients for whom blood cultures grew with another pathogen 4.

 Healthy controls The frozen samples collected in Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be shipped to Belgium.

 All selection of all the samples collected will undergo proteomic analysis by researchers of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in collaboration with the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie and coded data related to the samples is shared with these partners.

 Once this test has been developed, the samples will also be used for validation and evaluation of this test.

 IDIS Project Work Package 2: Establishing a Biobank at ITM and Collaborating Centres@highlight

The IDIS study aims to develop a new rapid diagnostic test for invasive salmonellosis using samples (blood, urine) collected from patients with fever and healthy controls at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) and collaborating centers.

 The samples are collected after informed consent and/or assent is given by the participant and are stored in a -80 C freezer after processing (centrifugation and/or aliquoting).

 Basic information regarding the patient and the samples are coded and stored in a protected Microsoft Access database.

 The samples will be shipped to Belgium for proteomic analysis.

 Identification of Salmonella specific proteins in the samples will hopefully support the development of a rapid diagnostic test.

 Once this test has been developed, the samples will also be used for validation and evaluation of this test.
