(thirdQuint)Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Therapy Optimization in Neonates for Better Neuroprotection With Inhalative CO2.

 Specific aims: 1.

 To test the feasibility of low concentration inhalative CO2 gas mixture (5% CO2 + 95% air) administration to achieve a desired range of pCO2 of 40-60 mmHg in asphyxiated, cooled, mechanically ventilated newborns at risk of hypocapnia with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

 2.

 To test the safety of CO2 gas mixture (5% CO2 + 95% air) inhalation in asphyxiated, cooled, mechanically ventilated newborns at risk of hypocapnia with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

 Term infants ( 36 weeks of gestation) will have to be at risk of hypocapnia to be eligible, as defined by a temperature corrected pCO2 40 mmHg in blood gas analysis, at any time within six hours of life.

 The gas mixture will be administered through patient circuits in conventional ventilators.

 Administered CO2 level will be closely monitored at the inhalation circuit (constant 5% = 36 mmHg).

 Blood gas samples will be taken hourly to ensure targeted and tolerable pCO2 levels.

 Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Therapy Optimization in Neonates for Better Neuroprotection With Inhalative CO2@highlight

This is a Phase I, open-label, single center trial to evaluate the feasibility and safety of low concentration CO2 gas mixture (5% CO2 + 95% air) inhalation in asphyxiated, cooled, mechanically ventilated newborns at risk of hypocapnia with The hypothesis is that hypocapnia, which is driven by hyperventilation in the presence of metabolic acidosis, is deleterious to the injured brain and can be safely avoided with low concentration CO2 inhalation.
