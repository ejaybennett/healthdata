(firstQuint)Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Single Doses of TAK-828 in Healthy Participants.

 The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-828.

 TAK-828 is being tested to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single oral doses of TAK-828 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants.

 The study will enroll approximately 36 healthy participants.

 An interleaving crossover design with placebo substitution will be used for Cohorts 1-3.

 Each cohort will consist of 12 participants, randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment sequence to receive TAK-828 or placebo after undergoing a fasting stage of at least 8 hours through intervention periods 1-4 for Cohorts 1 and 2 and through intervention periods 1 - 3 for Cohort 3.

 The assigned treatment sequence will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need).

 An additional interventional period 5 (fed state) is planned to be conducted in either cohort 1 or 2, based on the dose of TAK-828 that will be chosen to be studied under fed conditions.

 Cohorts 1 and 2 were conducted in non-Japanese participants and Cohort 3 in Japanese participants.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted in The United States.

 Participants will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 4 of each intervention period and will return 7 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
