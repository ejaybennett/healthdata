(thirdQuint)Standardization of a Novel Self-administered Tablet Computer-based Clinical Screening Tool for Adverse Postoperative Cognitive Outcomes.

 Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common complications after surgery and may affect elderly patients in particular.

 Prior studies found risk factors for POD and POCD which are present preoperatively, e.

g.

 older age and pre-existing cognitive impairment.

 However, the preoperative risk of postoperative adverse cognitive outcomes (POD and POCD) is often not screened in routine clinical practice as it is time-consuming and requires trained personnel.

 In 2014, the application for tablet computers "Delirium Risk Profile" (DRP) was developed at the University Hospital Basel to assist preoperative screening in surgical patients.

 The application was later renamed CogCheck as the scope of the tool was extended to POD and POCD risk assessment.

 The aim of this study is to provide normative data for the application.

 Ultimately, the objective is to assist health care providers in the evaluation of patients' cognitive functions by routinely using the application in preoperative clinics.

 Standardization of a Novel Self-administered Tablet Computer-based Clinical Screening Tool for Adverse Postoperative Cognitive Outcomes@highlight

Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common complications after surgery and may affect elderly patients in particular.

 CogCheck, an application for tablet computers, was developed with the intention to assist preoperative risk screening for POD and POCD in surgical patients.

 The aim of this study is to generate normative data with cognitively healthy participants for the application.
