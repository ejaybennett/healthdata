(fifthQuint)Tendon Fenestration Versus Surgery for the Treatment of Chronic Lateral Epicondylosis.

 STUDY DESIGN: Phase II, prospective, two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled study.

 SETTING: Up to 64 patients (56 + 15% loss to follow-up) suffering from chronic lateral epicondylosis will be recruited by one of two orthopedists working in a specialized outpatient clinic, at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CHUM), a tertiary care academic center.

 Ultrasound examination of the elbow will be performed before the interventions.

 RANDOMIZATION: Using a computerized randomization list, the subjects will be randomized into the 2 treatment arms to be treated either by an US-guided tendon fenestration technique or by mini-open surgery.

 Randomization will be stratified by block sizes of 8.

 FOLLOW UP Subjects' follow-up will extend over a period of 12 months - i.

e.

, at 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention.

 The primary outcome will be the PRTEE score.

 Secondary outcomes will evaluate the impact of each procedure on: Pain-free grip (dynamometer), Medication Quantitative Scale, working activity (QuickDASH general and work modules; RA-WIS), Patient Global Impression of Change and Patient Satisfaction.

 The ultrasound examination will be repeated at 6 and 12 months.

 The predictive value of various B-mode parameters, color Doppler and elastography will be explored.

 ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects in each intervention arm presenting a reduction of at least 11/100 of the PRTEE score at 6 months post-intervention.

 The Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group.

 The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle.

 Regarding the secondary endpoints, an ANOVA for repeated measures with two factors (time and group), a Fisher's exact test or a recursive partitioning analysis will be performed as appropriate.

 Tendon Fenestration Versus Surgery for the Treatment of Chronic Lateral Epicondylosis@highlight

Lateral epicondylosis, also called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis, is a prevalent, painful syndrome of the elbow.

 It is refractory to conservative treatment measures, including rest, excentric and concentric exercises in approximately 20% of patients after 6 months.

 Corticosteroid injections can provide relief in the short term.

 Mini-open surgery may be proposed when the conservative treatment fails and studies have shown an efficacy of 70%.

 Ultrasound-guided tendon fenestration is a minimally-invasive technique which stimulates the physiological healing mechanisms of the tendon and appears promising for the treatment of chronic tendinopathies.

 To our knowledge, no studies have compared the US-guided fenestration technique to mini-open surgery for the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylosis.

 The primary objective of this pilot study is to compare the efficacy of US-guided fenestration to mini-open surgery to reduce pain and improve functional status in workers suffering from chronic lateral epicondylosis refractory to 6-month conservative treatment.

 This is a prospective single-blind randomized pilot study.

 Sixty-four subjects will be randomized into two intervention groups for treatment either by US-guided fenestration or mini-open surgery.

 The primary outcome of the study will be the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) score at 6 month post-procedure.
