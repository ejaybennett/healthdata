(secondQuint)Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of GW003 in Patients With Breast Cancer.

 This is an single-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled phase I study evaluating tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of single subcutaneous injections of GW003 in the breast cancer patients.

GW003 is recombinant human serum albumin/human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(I)fusion protein .

It is a long-acting G-CSF(Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor).

 In this study, participants will be administered a single dose of GW003.
