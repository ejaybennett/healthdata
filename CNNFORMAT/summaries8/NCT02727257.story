(fifthQuint)The Effect of a Motor-cognitive Rehabilitation on Attention in Parkinsonian Patients.

 Objective: To evaluate the attentive performances in Parkinsonians in comparison with healthy controls and the effect of motor-cognitive rehabilitation program on attention.

 Methods: 103 Parkinsonians (stage 2,5-3 H&Y) hospitalized for a 4-week Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment and 34 healthy controls were enrolled.

 All subjects underwent three different attentive tasks: visual reaction times, auditory reaction times and multiple choices reaction times tasks.

 To evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on attention, patients performed the same battery at discharge.

 To investigate the effects of MIRT on motor functions and quality of life we also assessed UPDRS III, Timed Up and Go test and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire.

 The Effect of a Motor-cognitive Rehabilitation on Attention in Parkinsonian Patients@highlight

In this study the Investigators explore two questions: if the attentive reaction times differs in parkinsonian patients from health controls and if an intensive, focused and aerobic rehabilitation program (Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment - MIRT) tailored mainly for motor problems, could have a specific positive effect on multiple choices Reaction Times (RTs) as an indirect marker for an effect on attentional-executive frontal circuits.

 The hypothesis is that the MIRT could have a positive effect on the top-down control mechanisms, since the continuous feedback given by physiotherapist during exercises and the use of cues and devices (such as treadmill plus and stabilometric platform), stimulate the selective attention processes that enable goal-directed, internally-driven decision, helping the patients to overcome externally-driven decision based on stimulus salience and novelty
