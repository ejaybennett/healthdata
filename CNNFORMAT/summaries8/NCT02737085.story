(secondQuint)the Sequential Therapy of CD19-targeted and CD20-targeted CAR-T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL).

 The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and exhibited good clinical outcomes.

 The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown excellent therapeutic efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia.

 However, patients treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation.

 Therefore we attempt to treat Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) patients by sequential therapy of the 2 targets and hope to combine their advantages.

The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect of CD19-targeted and CD20-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL)
