(firstQuint)Photodisinfection for the Decolonization of Staphylococcus Aureus in Hemodialysis Patients.

 This is a medical research study is to eliminate Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (decolonization) from nares of patients who are colonized with this organism.

 Bacterial colonization of the anterior nares (inside of the nose) is believed to play an important role in the development of infection of central venous catheter, such as the line used for hemodialysis, and subsequent bloodstream infection.

 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be lethal against all classes of microorganisms: Gram-positive and, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi (fungus), viruses, parasites and even spores.

 In addition to the antimicrobial effects PDT also demonstrates an anti-inflammatory effect.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PDT in nasal decolonization of S.

 aureus in hemodialysis patients.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether PDT (MRSAid cent ) is effective in eradicating SA from hemodialysis patients who are known to harbor this organism inside their nose.
