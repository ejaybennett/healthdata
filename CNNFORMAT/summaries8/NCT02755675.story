(firstQuint)uPAR-PET for Prognostication in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma and Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung.

 Study I: uPAR PET/CT with 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 will be evaluated as a prognostic tool in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage IV (Ia) operable disease (Ib)) by observer-blinded readings and compared to the prognostic performance of FDG PET/CT and prognostic biomarkers as uPAR.

 Furthermore, uPAR PET/CT will be evaluated in a pilot study in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (Study II) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) (Study III) and correlated with immunohistochemical uPAR expression.
