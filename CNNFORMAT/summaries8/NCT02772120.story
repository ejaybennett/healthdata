(thirdQuint)Comparison of Vaginal and Intramuscular Progesterone in Vitrified-warmed Blastocyst Transfer Cycles.

 The hypothesis of this study is that the type of progesterone administered (intramuscular progesterone or Crinone(R) 8% vaginal gel) does not affect implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in women receiving cryo-thawed blastocysts that were produced using their own eggs and frozen before age 41 years.

 Both intramuscular progesterone (25-100 mg compounded in oil) or vaginal progesterone (Crinone(R) 8% vaginal progesterone gel) are widely used for luteal phase support in patients receiving vitrified-warmed embryos.

 Crinone(R) 8% is FDA approved for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency (FDA approval letter, 1997).

 Comparison of Vaginal and Intramuscular Progesterone in Vitrified-warmed Blastocyst Transfer Cycles@highlight

The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the pregnancy rates of women (ages 18-50 years) undergoing transfer of vitrified-warmed blastocysts (frozen at less than 41 years of age) as part of their IVF treatment are not different with respect to the administration of progesterone (Crinone(R) 8% vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone).
