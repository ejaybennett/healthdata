(secondQuint)HRIM vs Mucosal Impedance in GERD Participants.

 Patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Rochester for a clinically indicated high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM), 24 hour impedance pH (MII-pH) study, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be recruited.

 Gastroesophageal reflux will be defined as a total 24 hour esophageal acid exposure time 5% regardless of concomitant Proton Pump inhibitor (PPI) use.

 A negative 24 hour MII-pH study will be defined as an acid exposure time 2% off PPI therapy or 1% if on PPI therapy.

 HRIM vs Mucosal Impedance in GERD Participants@highlight

Does baseline impedance measured during the landmark phase of esophageal High resolution impedance manometry HRIM correlates with direct mucosal impedance measurement and discriminates GERD from non GERD patients?
