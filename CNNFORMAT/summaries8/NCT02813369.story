(fifthQuint)Naloxegol Health Outcomes PASS.

 The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the safety of naloxegol in the indicated population and within at-risk vulnerable populations identified in the naloxegol risk management plan (RMP) by describing type and frequency of identified and potential risks (including bowel perforation, acute MI, stroke, CV-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity) in patients 18 years of age diagnosed with non-cancer pain who were treated with opioids chronically and subsequently treated with naloxegol in routine post-authorization use.

 The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of bowel perforation, acute MI, stroke, all-cause mortality, and hypertension in patients treated with naloxegol (Naloxegol Inception Cohort, (NIC)), a Concurrent Reference Cohort (CRC), and by pre-specified sub-populations that include patients aged 65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with concurrent use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors/inducer or P-glycoprotein (Pgp) modulators.

 An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of CV-specific mortality, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity in patients treated with naloxegol (NIC), a CRC, and by pre-specified sub-populations that include patients aged 65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors/inducer or Pgp modulators.

 Naloxegol Health Outcomes PASS@highlight

This post-authorization observational safety study (PASS) monitors clinically important identified and potential risks within a cohort of patients treated with naloxegol, including the occurrence of bowel perforation, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular (CV)-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity.

 This study is part of a broader post-marketing commitment to augment routine evaluation of the safety profile of naloxegol in clinical practice.
