(secondQuint)Multimodal Imaging Analysis During Treatment With Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma.

 Glioblastomas are tumors with poor prognosis.

 The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after a standard first-line treatment is not clearly codified, however, many results in the literature show the benefit of bevacizumab (anti- angiogenic therapy) and it is often proposed in this indication .

 Tissue action, response mechanisms and therapeutic escape remain is poorly understood.

 The investigators hypothesize that these response mechanisms are controlled by changes in some parameters in the tumor tissue, such as hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, cell density and that multimodal imaging can help us to better understand these mechanisms.

 To identify which parameters of imaging would best measure response mechanisms, the investigators want to evaluate in the first study and for this particular indication , a property of the measure called by the Anglo -Saxon ' sensitivity to change " that is to say, its sensitivity or ability to measure changes.

 This is an additional property to the reproducibility of the measurement.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the capacity of the multimodal imaging parameters measured at 15 days and 2 months of initiation of treatment with bevacizumab, to measure changes in clinical status (sensitivity to measure changes) in patients treated for recurrent glioblastoma.
