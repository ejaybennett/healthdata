(fifthQuint)IDeaL Pilot Study - Infliximab Dose to Level: Pilot Study.

 Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.

 Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include: anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness.

 Symptoms often include: abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever and weight loss.

 Crohn's disease is caused by a combination of environmental, immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals.

 It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens.

 The estimated prevalence of CD in Canada is 234 per 100,000 persons, with an incidence rate of 13.

4 per 100,000.

 There are no medications or surgical procedures that can cure Crohn's disease.

 Treatment options help with symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent relapse.

 The burden of disease is high with disease flares and complications leading to hospitalizations, surgeries, school and work absenteeism, and impaired quality of life.

 Infliximab (IFX) is a murine chimeric lgGl anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody shown in landmark clinical trials to be well-tolerated and effective for induction, and maintenance, of remission in pediatric and adult CD and ulcerative colitis.

 In Canada, the safety and efficacy of IFX is not established in children under the age of 9, yet is often prescribed to younger children off label when other therapies do not resolve their disease symptoms.

 IFX can be influenced by multiple factors such as body mass index (BMI), serum albumin level, burden of inflammation and the concomitant use of immunosuppressive medications.

 Loss of response to IFX can either be a result of Antibodies to IFX (ATI) or insufficient serum IFX level.

 ATI have been shown to develop in about 17% of those treated with IFX.

 The risk for development of ATI is even higher in those who receive IFX mono-therapy, compared to those receiving concomitant immunomodulator.

 It is now clear that those with persistent ATI have a three to fivefold increased risk of loss of response to IFX compared to those without ATI.

 ATI appears to interfere with the bioactivity of IFX and those patients who develop ATI are more likely to subsequently manifest infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis.

 The standard infusion regimen for IFX is three loading dose of 5mg/kg (dose is often rounded up to the nearest 100mg) at 0, 2, 6 weeks then every 8 weeks thereafter.

 The trough level of IFX after the 3rd loading dose (week 14 - i.

e.

 before the 4th infusion) is often found to be at greatest risk of being low; especially in children.

 A recent study has shown that 29% of children have an undetectable IFX level at the 4th medication infusion.

 A trough level of 5 ug /ml at this time point is associated with higher remission rates.

 Conversely, a low trough level ( 3 ug/ml (range 2.

3 to 4.

9) is associated with maintenance of remission.

 However this value tends to reflect the limit of detection of the assay used rather than the actual biologic threshold.

 Lamblin reported a higher IFX level of 6.

33ug /ml to be associated with higher remission rates compared to a level of 3.

39 ug /ml.

 Based on these authors' modeling, a level 5.

6 ug /ml would lead to lower inflammatory burden based on C reactive protein (CRP} 45 ug/ml and R2 = 0.

98 for values 2 ug/ml in samples having an IFX concentration < 10 ug/ml.

 A second ELISA is available which measures total ATI (i.

e.

 free and bound to circulating IFX), and can detect antibody in samples with higher IFX concentrations if needed.

 This test is now available for clinical use in the Edmonton Zone.

 However the current indication for the test is only for those patients who exhibit clinical loss of response to IFX.

 Dose Optimization is common, 70% of us dose optimize clinically.

 Early dose optimization after third infusion likely to be better.

 How to dose optimize is unclear.

 IDeaL Pilot Study - Infliximab Dose to Level: Pilot Study@highlight

Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong condition of inflammation in the bowel.

 CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.

 Symptoms can include: tiredness, stomach pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if the disease is severe), fever, weight loss, skin rashes, arthritis and inflammation of the eye.

 Infliximab-IFX (Remicade(R)) is a medication that is used to treat CD in adults and children.

 In adults it has been shown that the amount of this drug a person has in their blood can show how well it is working for them.

 Health Canada has approved Infliximab -IFX for the treatment of CD in children 9 and older.

 In Canada, doctors may prescribe Inflixmab to younger children when other therapies do not resolve their disease symptoms.

 This is called "off-label" use of Infliximab.

 IFX levels in the body and consequently its efficacy can be influenced by many biological characteristics within the patient's body.

 In about 17% of those treated with IFX, the patient's immune response against IFX may lead to a three to fivefold increased risk of loss of response.

 This immune response to the medication often occurs when drug levels are undetectable in the body.

 Thus it is in order to achieve best results with this treatment, physicians need to be able to adjust dosing specific to each patient.

 A recent study has shown that 29% of children have an undetectable IFX level at the 4th medication infusion.

 Up to 40% of patients receiving scheduled IFX have undetectable drug level prior to their next infusion.

 In order to minimize the loss of response, we hope to conduct an observational cohort study of pediatric patients treated with IFX.

 This open label, cohort study aims to: 1.

 Determine the pharmacokinetics of IFX in children with CD and the factors that affect IFX levels during the first three loading infusions 2.

 Obtain data to create a model that can guide and adjust the IFX dose and frequency to achieve optimal trough level between 5 and 10 ug /ml at 14 weeks.
