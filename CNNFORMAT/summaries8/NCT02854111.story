 Regarding the diagnosis of DM, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) identifies about 2% more individuals than does fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

 Hence OGTT is the method that has high sensitivity compared to other methods for diagnosis of IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and diabetes.

 However, standard OGTT with 75-g glucose has poor patient tolerance and might cause reactive hypoglycemia.

 The alternatives for 75-g glucose would help for screening of DM with better tolerance.

 There were previous studies investigated substitutes for oral glucose solution with cookies and muffin.

 In the present study we hypothesized that an alternative food such as ice cream, a favorite dessert, can use for evaluation of the diagnosis of DM and IGT instead of standard 75-g glucose.

The overall global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is rising.

 Based on the latest Thai National Health Examination Survey, an estimated 3.

2 million people had DM, of whom one-third was undiagnosed.

 The inexpensive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a more sensitive and reliable test of DM than fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1c, and is recommended for diagnosing DM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

 Although the OGTT provides useful diagnostic information, poor patient tolerance of glucose solutions is inevitable.
