(secondQuint)Comparison of Biannual Ultrasonography and Annual Unenhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for HCC Surveillance.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical feasibility of annual non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma in high-risk group, in comparison with biannual ultrasonography.

 In addition, the relationship between non-contrast MR parameters and clinical manifestation of liver function is investigated.
