(fifthQuint)Treatment Outcome in Major Depressive Disorder.

 Study population and study program: Patients will be recruited through a unique new central referral site for "depression packages" in The Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark.

 100 patients with MDD, 18-65 years of age, with moderate to severe single or recurrent episode of MDD (Hamilton 17 item (HAMD-17) score > 17) will be recruited through this portal.

 All diagnoses will be confirmed by a specialist in psychiatry.

 Before initiation of pharmacological antidepressant treatment with escitalopram, patients will receive baseline examinations as follows: 1) 5-HT4R imaging with 11C-SB207145 PET-scan, 2) EEG examinations, 3) structural MRI, 4) functional MRI , 5) neuropsychological testing, 6) peripheral markers of immune-active cell responses, oxidative stress, cortisol-levels, RNA, genotypes and epigenetic factors will be measured in urine, saliva and peripheral blood at baseline and across the study period.

 Repeated measures across the study period include: 7) psychometrics by using self-reported questionnaires covering trait and state, including mental distress related to depression and other psychopathology, 8) neuropsychological examinations as well as 9) clinical follow-up with interview based ratings of mental status.

 Patients will be treated with escitalopram at flexible doses of 10-20 mg/day adjusted depending on effects and side effects, and participate in clinical follow-up sessions at week 1, 2, 4 and 8.

 Patients with no response to escitalopram after 4 weeks will be shifted to a secondary pharmacological treatment (duloxetine).

 A final visit to determine longer-term clinical outcome will be performed at week 12.

 Compliance, side-effects to antidepressant treatment, and depressive symptoms will be monitored at each follow-up session.

 The Hamilton 6 items (HAMD-6) subscale has recently shown to be more sensitive to antidepressant response (Ostergaard et al), and will be used to identify treatment response in patients.

 Patients with > 50 % reduction in HAMD-6 after 4 weeks will be defined as early responders, and those with additional 25% response at week 4 and 7) predicts poor antidepressant treatment outcome.

 18.

 We expect urinary markers of oxidatively generated DNA/RNA damage to increase more in responders than in non-responders.

 19.

 With an exploratory approach it will be possible to identify a set of predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome.

 This explorative analysis includes genetics, epigenetics, peripheral and central neurobiological characteristics, neuropsychology testing outcomes, psychometry including self-reported mental distress, both cross-sectional at baseline and as longitudinal measures.

 Ethical Aspects: The study protocol complies with the Declaration of Helsinki II and approval by all relevant authorities will be obtained before initiation.

 All human volunteers will receive oral and written information about the given study and provide written informed consent before enrolment.

 The trial is monitored by a Good Clinical Practise unit for the relevant domains.

 Treatment Outcome in Major Depressive Disorder@highlight

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most severe and frequently occurring brain disorders worldwide.

 It has been linked to serotonergic dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, vulnerability to stress and neuro-inflammation.

 However, at the same time the etiological understanding is limited.

 Most antidepressants act on the serotonin (5- HT) system, yet between 30-50 % of patients with MDD does not respond successfully to 5-HT acting drugs.

 Recent experimental models from our group suggest that cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo can be indexed through molecular brain imaging of the 5-HT 4 receptor (5-HT4R) with a novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligand (11C-SB207145).

 Also, our human studies have confirmed that cerebral synaptic 5-HT is inversely related to 5-HT4R binding and this technique thus can be used to investigate the role of 5-HT tone in the brain in MDD with differential responses to standard antidepressant treatment.

 By using multimodal neuroimaging technology, we aim to determine the status of the 5-HT system prior to and after either successful or failed neuropharmacological intervention in a non-randomized longitudinal open clinical trial.

 100 untreated patients with moderate to severe MDD will be included.

 Data collection from various neurobiological domains (i.

e, 5-HT4R PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), psychometrics, neuropsychological tests, and peripheral biomarkers) will be conducted before, during and after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment.

 The objective is to identify predictors of pharmacological antidepressant treatment response in depressed individuals before and after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment.
