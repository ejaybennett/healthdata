(thirdQuint)Comparison of NaF PET-CT and Diffusion MRI in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases (IMMETAOS).

 Prospective, monocentric, comparative, non randomised.

 Organization of NaF PET-CT and MRI on the same day or within a 10 days period.

 At 6 months : - repeat both exams systematically if one of the initial tests showed a suspicious or doubtful abnormality - final diagnosis by a committee of practitioners using the whole patient's file Scheduled Project inclusion duration of 36 months (possible adaptation of duration in order to obtain the number of required patients).

 Comparison of NaF PET-CT and Diffusion MRI in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases (IMMETAOS)@highlight

Prospective, monocentric, comparative, non randomised Primary objective : - to compare the diagnostic accuracy of sodium fluoride PET-CT and MRI using the conventional block and diffusion sequence in the search for bone metastases Secondary objectives : - compare accuracy of MRI diffusion and conventional MRI - explore the evolution of the results of the different types of imaging over time or under treatment for patients with repeated examinations at 6 months
