(secondQuint)Serum Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen Level and Tumor Volume in Head and Neck Cancer.

 The study is a cross-sectional study.

 A single measurement of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level is performed in the eligible Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.

 The study tool measuring serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level is ARCHITECT SCC (Abbott).

 The gross tumor volume in the cross sectional imaging obtained within 2 weeks of each patient is calculated with the typical ellipsoid formula.

 Correlation between both parameters will be determined.
