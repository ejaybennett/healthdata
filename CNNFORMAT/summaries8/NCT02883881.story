(secondQuint)Correlation Between Eye Rubbing and Keratoconus Severity in a Treatment-naive Keratoconic Population.

 A retrospective study was performed between november 2014 and october 2015 in the Metz Hospital Center.

 Were included 33 patients presenting with treatment-naive keratoconus.

 Patients responded to a questionnaire that assessed eye rubbing habits, family history of keratoconus, history of atopy.

 2 groups were separated: group 1 constituted by 15 eyes with no eye rubbing, and group 2 constituted by 18 eyes with moderate or severe eye rubbing.

 The following informations were collected: best visual corrected acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent value (SEV), corneal opacities or Vogt striae.

 For each eye were performed an anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) to determine the OCT stage for keratoconus (Fourrier domain OCT classification, 2013), and a Scheimpflug camera imaging to determine the maximal keratometry (Kmax) and the minimal corneal thickness (MCT).

determination if, within a keratoconic population, strong eye rubbing was correlated with visual acuity, spherical equivalent value, biomicroscopic signs, corneal pachymetry, keratometry, and tomography classification determinating keratoconus stage.
