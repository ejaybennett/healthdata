 Parent studies that are eligible for patients to continue to receive IMCgp100 in this rollover study must have completed and satisfied its primary endpoints or have been terminated by the Sponsor for reasons other than safety.

 Eligible patients will have tolerated IMCgp100 for a minimum of 4 weeks of dosing without significant toxicities that would preclude further dosing in the opinion of the principal investigator or Sponsor.
