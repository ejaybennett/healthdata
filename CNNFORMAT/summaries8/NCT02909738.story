(secondQuint)Measuring Ability of Healthy Volunteers to Power a Bicycle-powered Oxygen Concentrator.

 The investigators would like to test how many healthy people can power the oxygen concentrator by pedaling the bike for at least 30 minutes.

 If the healthy volunteers can bike for at least 30 minutes, the investigators assume they are pedaling at or below their lactate threshold.

 The investigators have literature values which suggest bigger people should be able to output more work, and the investigators wish to use a sample of the population to verify that most of the people can power our system.

 The investigators have a good estimate of the power required by our system, and the investigators want to verify the average person can actually do what we calculated is necessary.

 Measuring Ability of Healthy Volunteers to Power a Bicycle-powered Oxygen Concentrator@highlight

The investigators would like to test how well healthy human volunteers power a modified oxygen concentrator.

 The investigators modified the oxygen concentrator to be powered by a bicycle instead of wall power so that it can be used in low resource countries where the power supply is unreliable.
