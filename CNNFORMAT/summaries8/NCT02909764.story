(thirdQuint)Shifting Salty Taste Preferences in Children.

 This is a within- and between-subjects randomized controlled trial on children consuming either a low sodium or a higher sodium cereal over a 2-month period to determine if repeated exposure to the low sodium cereal is effective for reducing preference for salt in that food.

 Children will be genotyped for markers related to salty taste, dietary intake will be recorded, and anthropometric and physiological measures will be collected to determine if an association between any observed shift in salt preference and these measures exists.

 Shifting Salty Taste Preferences in Children@highlight

The goals of the proposed research are to determine whether repeated exposure to a low sodium food will result in reduced preference for salt in that food among children; and to determine whether such reductions in preference are related to dietary intake of salt, taste receptor genotype, and anthropometric and physiological measures.
