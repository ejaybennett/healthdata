(firstQuint)Phase II Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer With Fulvestrant or Tamoxifen.

 The primary objectives are to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in fulvestrant and tamoxifen arms in patients unselected by ESR1 mutation, and in the subset of patients with ESR1-mt tumors assessed primarily from ctDNA at enrollment.

 Patients with ER+ breast cancer who had 1 to 3 prior lines of endocrine therapy and up to one line of chemotherapy for MBC, excluding fulvestrant and tamoxifen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive fulvestrant 500mg IM Q28 days with one extra dose on D15 of the first cycle (as a loading dose) or tamoxifen 20mg PO daily.
