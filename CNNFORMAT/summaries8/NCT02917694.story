(thirdQuint)A Feasibility Study to Assess Pre Admission Status and Six Month Outcomes After Major Trauma.

 Currently there is no standardised way of obtaining details about a patients pre-admission level of function.

 the process of gaining this history is often done by several different people with no standard questions asked.

 There is also a need to be able to measure what happens to patients after they leave ICU, and compare their abilities to preadmission status.

 This feasibility study will aim to investigate: - the time taken to train the physiotherapy team in the use of the outcome measure - the ability to obtain pre admission functional status from patients/friend/relative on admission to ICU - the ability to follow patients up at 6 months post discharge with re-assessment of the outcome measure.

 A Feasibility Study to Assess Pre Admission Status and Six Month Outcomes After Major Trauma@highlight

This study aims to assess the feasibility of obtaining details about a patients previous level of function from the patient of friend/relative, after they have been admitted an intensive care unit (ICU).

 It will also assess the feasibility of re-assessing level of function at 6 months after the patient has been discharged from ICU.
