(thirdQuint)Myotonometric Measurement of Myofascial Trigger Points: Reliability, Validity and Sensitivity.

 Previous researches have used complicated and expensive methods to measure mechanical properties of muscle tone like isokinetic dynamometer.

 The purpose of this investigation is to establish the reliability, validity and sensitivity of a myotonometer to assess myofascial trigger points.

 The results of this study will verify the inter-reliability of a myotonometer device in order to evaluate muscle tone, examine correlations and associations between myotonometric measurements and isokinetic measurements and provide a measurable understanding of the location of myofascial trigger points.

 Assessment: Myoton device is a simple and portable tool to obtain quantitative and objective assessments of mechanical properties of muscle tone.

 Isokinetic dynamometric technique is considered a valid biomechanics method to measure muscle tone in non-injured subjects but isokinetic machine is a heavy and expensive equipment.

 Outcome measures: Myotonometric measures will include muscle frequency, decrement (elasticity) and stiffness.

 Isokinetic measures will include passive resistive torque to ankle dorsiflexion and dorsiflexion passive range of motion (PROM) All outcome measures will be evaluated once.
