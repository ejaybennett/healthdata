 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative neurological disorders involving progressive impairment in motor, mood and cognitive functions.

 Movement disorders have a negative impact on individual's ability to perform well-learned motor skills.

 These include akinesia, bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor at rest.
