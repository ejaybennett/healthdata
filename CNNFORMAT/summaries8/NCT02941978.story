(thirdQuint)Motivational Interviewing to Support Oral AntiCoagulation Adherence in Patients With Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (MISOAC-AF).

 Study Purpose: To investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the adherence of patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens Trial Type: Randomised clinical study Clinical Design: Prospective, single center, randomized control study Primary Objective: The primary outcome is overall adherence to OAC regimen in the year after hospitalization for any reason, reported as both a continuous and a binary outcome Secondary Objective: The secondary clinical outcome is a combined endpoint of death, acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke or major bleeding at 1 year Sample Size: 1000 subjects Population: Subjects with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) on OAC therapy or prescribed OAC therapy that are hospitalized for any reason.

 Intervention 1.

 Motivational Interview - Baseline: At hospital discharge, patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted in person by a study physician (MD) and will be given a leaflet that will educate them about the risk for stroke and the importance of adherence to OAC medication.

 2.

 Motivational Interview - Follow-up: Patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after discharge.

 The three elements of medication adherence (initiation, implementation, and discontinuation) will be evaluated.

 Based on the patient's dosing history, the delegated study personnel will assess whether an intervention is required and provide specific support tailored to the needs of the patient Control Patients assigned to the control group will be contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 year after discharge Clinical Duration:The total study duration is expected to be 3 years.

The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the adherence of patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens.

 Half of the patients will be interviewed and guide on the importance of adherence to OAC medication.

 Patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after discharge.

 Patients in the control group will be contacted at 1 year after discharge.
