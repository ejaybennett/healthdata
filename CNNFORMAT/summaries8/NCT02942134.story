(thirdQuint)Acute Dyspnea After Use of Non-invasive Ventilation in COPD and Emphysema (Deventilation Syndrome).

 Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a widespread therapy option for patients with hypercapnic failure due to COPD and emphysema.

 Augmented dyspnea after use of NIV is commonly found and leads not only to high patient discomfort, but can also be associated with acute respiratory failure.

 This monocentric obervation trial includes patients with COPD III-IV (GOLD) and emphysema and an established long term NIV therapy.

 During their routine inpatient follow-up, we will extend the routine examinations, focussing on the vulnerable first hour after the nocturnal use of NIV.

 This includes monitoring of breath rate, heart rate, pulsoxymetry, trancutaneous CO2, blood pressure and capillary blood gas analysis.

 Sonographic measurement of diaphragm movement and thickness will be complemented.

 Subjective dyspnea will be documented by use of the BORG scale.

 By collecting this data, we hope to understand the pathomechanisms causing augmented dyspnea after NIV and thus provide information for therapeutical concepts to prevent it.

 Acute Dyspnea After Use of Non-invasive Ventilation in COPD and Emphysema (Deventilation Syndrome)@highlight

Acute dyspnea after use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a common phenomenon in patients with COPD and emphysema.

 This trial aims to document incidence and severity of augmented dyspnea in patients with long term NIV therapy.

 These findings may help in understanding the pathomechanisms that lead to post-NIV dyspnea and thus give way to potential therapy schemes.
