(firstQuint)Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Enhances Islet Autograft Survival in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis.

 The goal of this study is to assess whether infusion of Prolastin-C during peri-transplant period can enhance islet autograft survival and function in chronic pancreatitis patients who have total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation.

 This is a prospective, controlled, double-blind study.

 The primary endpoint will be area under the curve for the serum C-peptide level during the first 4 hours of an mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), normalized by the number of islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg at day 36514 after the transplant.
