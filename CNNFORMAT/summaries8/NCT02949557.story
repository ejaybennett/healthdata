(fifthQuint)DFDBA and Xenograft (Cerabone)TM With Decortication in Intrabony Defects.

 There have been great strides in the management of periodontal intrabony defects, especially with the use of bone graft materials.

 It is necessary to choose the most appropriate material and procedure in order to obtain the desired regeneration.

 Among the bone grafts, Demineralised freezed dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and xenografts have shown good results in the management of intrabony defects.

 Recently, a novel bovine xenograft i.

e.

, Cerabone cent has shown maximum resemblance to human bone with the potential to reconstruct bone defects.

 Decortication or intramarrow penetration of the bone has shown favourable results in guided bone regeneration procedures.

 So the goal of the present study was to check the efficacy of decortication with decalcified freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and Cerabone cent bone grafts and to compare the response between the bonegrafts placed following decortication using RVG and CBCT, in intrabony defect.

 The combination of decortication with bone grafts i.

e.

, DFDBA and (Cerabone)TM can be an added advantage in the treatment of intrabony defects.

 To the best of the investigators knowledge no clinical trial reports this combination therapy in scientific literature.

 There is need for further research in this area.

 DFDBA and Xenograft (Cerabone)TM With Decortication in Intrabony Defects@highlight

DFDBA is an allograft that possesses osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties.

 It has the potential for osteoinduction due to increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP).

Cerabone cent has shown maximum resemblance to human bone with the potential to reconstruct bone defects.

 Decortication is performed as a part of guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedure as it enhances the healing process.

Therefore a combination of decortication and bone graft when applied in periodontal intrabony defect would enhance the regeneration of periodontium.
