(firstQuint)Efficacy and Necessity of Anti-inflammatory Drops After Laser Peripheral Iridotomy.

 Primary closed angle glaucoma is responsible to almost half glaucoma related blindness around the world.

 Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is a common and simple treatment used for both treatment and prevention of acute angle closure event.

 Anti-inflammatory drops are commonly prescribed to patients undergoing LPI in order to prevent or reduce post-treatment discomfort.

 However, to date, there are no specific guidelines for post LPI anti-inflammatory treatment, nor sufficient clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of such treatment.

 In the current study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of topical steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on post LPI symptoms and inflammation markers.
