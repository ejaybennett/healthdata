(secondQuint)Follow-up Measurement of Brain PDE10A Enzyme Levels in Huntingtons Disease Gene Expansion Carriers.

 The HDGECs will perform 2 study visits: Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (PET analysis utilizing the radioligand [18F]MNI-659).

 There will also be 2 telephone follow ups; one after Visit 1 (telephone follow-up after screening) and one after Visit 2, (telephone follow-up after PET).

 Study visits and telephone follow-ups will take place during a maximum of 97 days.

 Follow-up Measurement of Brain PDE10A Enzyme Levels in Huntingtons Disease Gene Expansion Carriers@highlight

The aim of this study is to measure longitudinally the availability of the PDE10A enzyme in HDGECs using the radioligand [18F]MNI-659.

 The study will be a follow-up, examining HDGECs from the CHDIKI1201/PET-HD-PDE10A (NCT02061722) study from 18 to 28 months after the initial PET measurement.
