(fifthQuint)Intervention to Improve Shared Decision Making Among Seniors With Dementia, Their Caregivers and Healthcare Providers.

 Background: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia causes new challenges in primary care.

 Indeed, primary care providers point to a need for more training to care for this population, especially seniors presenting behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

 They also find the inter-professional nature of care, and the need to communicate with community services and families, very challenging.

 Moreover, patients living with dementia and their caregivers consistently report their need for more information about dementia.

 Therefore, in a recent survey, the investigators sought five difficult decisions that patients living with dementia and their informal caregivers often face in primary care settings.

 In the current study, they propose to tailor and evaluate an e-learning professional training program on shared decision making, comprising evidence summaries on the health options to consider before making these five difficult decisions.

 This tailored training program is expected to improve shared decision making between clinicians and patients with dementia and their caregivers, and in turn improve patient and caregiver empowerment in relation to their own health care.

 Methods: In two phases, the aims of this study are to (1) design and tailor the intervention, and (2) implement and evaluate it.

 In the first phase, theory and user-centred design will be used to tailor a multifaceted intervention comprising a distance professional training program on shared decision making, and five shared decision-making tools dealing with difficult decisions often faced by seniors with dementia and their caregivers.

 Each tool will be designed in two versions, one for clinicians, and one for patients/caregivers.

 Forty-nine clinicians and 27 patients/caregivers will be invited to participate to three cycles of design-evaluation-feedback of each intervention components.

 Besides think-aloud and interview approaches, they will also complete questionnaires to identify the factors most likely to influence their adoption of shared decision making after exposure to the intervention.

 Thereafter, the intervention will be modified by adding/enhancing behaviour-change techniques targeting these factors.

 In the second phase, the effectiveness of this tailored intervention will be evaluated before/after implementation, in a two-armed, clustered randomized trial with a three-month follow-up.

 A convenience sample of 6 primary care clinics will be enrolled in the province of Quebec (Canada), and clinicians who practice there will be recruited (mostly family physicians, nurses, and social workers).

 These clinics will then be randomized to immediate exposure to the intervention, or usual care with delayed exposure to the intervention.

 Overall, 180 seniors with dementia, their caregivers, and their healthcare providers will be recruited.

 The investigators will evaluate impact of the intervention on patient involvement in the decision making process, decisional comfort, patient and caregiver personal empowerment in relation to their own health care, patient quality of life, caregiver burden, and decisional regret.

 Discussion: The intervention will empower patients and their caregivers in their health care, by fostering their participation as partners during the decision-making process, and by ensuring they make informed decisions congruent with their values and priorities.

 Intervention to Improve Shared Decision Making Among Seniors With Dementia, Their Caregivers and Healthcare Providers@highlight

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia causes new challenges to ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by research evidence and reflect what is important for seniors and their caregivers.

 Primary care providers point to a need for more training on communication with families of seniors living with dementia, and on the non-pharmacological health options that are often recommended before use of medications.

Therefore, the investigators will design and evaluate an intervention to train primary healthcare providers on how to empower seniors with dementia and their caregivers in making health-related decisions based on research evidence and on their preferences and priorities.

 A distance professional training program on shared decision making will initially be designed, comprising evidence summaries to be shared with patients living with dementia and their caregivers who face difficult decisions.

 Patients with dementia, their caregivers and healthcare providers, will then provide feedback on the training program, which will then be improved following their suggestions.

 In a last step, the investigators will evaluate whether this training program truly increases the participation of patients and their caregivers in decision making, their comfort with the decision that they have made, and their motivation and ability to control their life by taking care of their own health.
