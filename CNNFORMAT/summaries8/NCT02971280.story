(secondQuint)Influence of Heavy Metals Exposure on in Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Outcome.

 Concentration of heavy metals will be measured in blood, urine, semen fluid and follicular fluid of IVF patients.

 Study group: poor prognosis patients: repeated IVF failure, implantation failure, poor ovarian response, low sperm quality (according to WHO criteria) Control group: Good prognosis patients.

 Normal sperm count.

 Heavy metals concentrations will be measured using atomic absorption spectrometer, and will be correlated with IVF outcomes: number of mature oocytes obtained, fertilizations, embryos quality, and reproductive outcome post embryo transfer.

 Influence of Heavy Metals Exposure on in Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Outcome@highlight

Exposure to heavy metals may interfere with basic cellular functions, including DNA synthesis.

 The aim of the study is to correlate heavy metals concentration in body fluids of reproductive importance and IVF outcome.
