(thirdQuint)PVSRIPO With/Without Lomustine.

 This is a randomized phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone or in combination with the chemotherapy drug lomustine in adult patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke.

 The primary objective of this study is to assess the survival of subjects receiving PVSRIPO with or without a single dose of lomustine relative to the survival observed in a historical control group.

 The secondary objective is to assess the safety of PVSRIPO in combination with lomustine.

 Subjects will be randomized to receive either PVSRIPO alone, or PVSRIPO in combination with a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO infusion, to evaluate the impact of these treatment regimens on 24-month survival relative to historical controls.

 PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor.

 Subjects randomized to the lomustine arm will receive a single oral dose of 110 mg/m2 lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration.

 If a subject has been treated with bevacizumab in the time since PVSRIPO infusion, the lomustine dose will be dispensed as an oral therapy at 90 mg/m2 one time only 8 weeks after PVSRIPO infusion.

 The target accrual for the study is 62 patients, 31 patients per arm.

 All patients who are randomized and receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.
