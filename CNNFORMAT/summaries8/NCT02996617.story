(thirdQuint)PEG-rhG-CSF in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Receiving Chemotherapy to Prevent Neutropenia.

 Neutropenia is a common clinical complication of chemotherapy in cancer patients.

 It is an important factor that delays the course of standard treatments in patients.

 Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is an effective drug for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

 However, for patients with neutropenia, multiple rhG-CSF treatments are usually required.

 This is likely to extend the antitumor treatment period and increase physical and mental stress in patients.

 Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) is rhG-CSF chemically modified by a single methoxy polyethylene glycol group; it is able to alleviate neutropenia with a single dose.

 The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of preventive treatment with pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) on concurrent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to provide a rational basis for its clinical application.

 Therefore, the investigators designed the multi-center, open-label,randomized controlled clinical study and aimed to compare the efficacy and safety between PEG-rhG-CSF and rhG-CSF in non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving chemotherapy.

Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy.

 The PEG-rhG-CSF has increased plasma half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with rhG-CSF.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of PEG-rhG-CSF in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
