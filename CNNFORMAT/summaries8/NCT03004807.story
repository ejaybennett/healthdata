(fifthQuint)Role of Centrum Silver in Improving Micronutrient Status in Older Men.

 Older adults are at increased risk of various chronic diseases, in which inadequate levels of vitamins and minerals may play a significant role, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and cancer.

 Most adults in the United States do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Adequate Intake (AI) of many vitamins and nutritionally-essential minerals from diet alone, including vitamins A, C, D, E and K, calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

 Older adults are particularly susceptible to micronutrient inadequacies because of limited absorption, increased requirements, or - in the case of vitamin D - decreased synthetic capacity in the skin.

 Thus, there is a strong rationale for supplementing the diets of older adults with a multivitamin/multimineral supplement, such as Centrum(R) Silver(R).

 However, little is currently known about the bioavailability of the Centrum(R) Silver(R) formula in this age demographic.

 Epidemiological studies and recent clinical trials have shown that use of multivitamin/mineral supplements has beneficial effects on disease risk in men, including those of advanced age.

 It is assumed that these benefits of multivitamin/mineral supplements are achieved through changes in nutrition status.

 However, it has never been documented if there are concomitant changes in micronutrient levels in individuals who consume these supplements.

 Furthermore, changes in nutritional status in older individuals taking multivitamin/multimineral supplements are a subject that has yet to be explored.

 Therefore, this study seeks to recruit men who are in generally good health, 70 years of age or older, to assess their vitamin and mineral status before and after four months of supplementation with Centrum(R) Silver(R).

 The investigators hypothesize that consuming multivitamin/multimineral supplements everyday will result in measurable increases in the status of one or more vitamins or minerals in the body.

 Concentrations of several vitamins and minerals in blood samples will be performed, along with a general assessment of micronutrient status in white blood cells (primary outcomes).

 To see if these changes in nutrition status impact other aspects of human health, changes in lipid and lipoprotein profiles, antioxidant status, metabolic health, and inflammation and treatment differences in cognitive function will be assessed (secondary outcomes).

 Centrum(R) Silver(R) supplementation may or may not have any effect on these secondary outcomes, when compared to a placebo, unless there are measurable changes in the primary outcomes.

 The expectation is that the results of this research will add to a general understanding of multivitamin/mineral supplements and how well they can improve the nutritional status of older adults.

 By employing direct and functional methods to assay for nutritional content, this study will determine how well these methods correlate and by using both assay methods unique insight into the mechanism(s) whereby multivitamin/multimineral supplements might or might not lead to improvements in health may be ascertained.

 Role of Centrum Silver in Improving Micronutrient Status in Older Men@highlight

Older adults are susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies for a variety of reasons and have an increased demand for many of these micronutrients.

 Multivitamin/multimineral supplement offer a simple way for adults to improve nutrient intake, but their ability to measurably affect micronutrient status in older adults has never been explored.

 This study intends to recruit healthy, non-smoking men aged 70 years or older.

 After meeting entry criteria, subjects will be required to restrict the use of supplements and/or fortified foods.

 A month after these restrictions have begun, subjects will come to the clinical research center to take cognitive tests, undergo activity monitoring, provide blood samples for nutrition testing, and take food frequency questionnaires.

 Subjects will then be randomized into one of two groups - one consuming a multivitamin/multimineral supplement (Centrum Silver Mens Formula); another consuming an inert placebo tablet.

 Subjects will consume 1 tablet each day for sixteen weeks.

 After this period, subjects will return to the clinical research center and repeat cognitive tests, activity monitor, blood sampling, and food frequency questionnaires.

 These data will be assessed to determine if multivitamin consumption results in changes in various nutrients versus taking a placebo (primary outcomes), and may results in changes lipid and lipoprotein profiles, metabolic health, inflammation, blood pressure or cognitive function (secondary outcomes).

 The investigators expect that results of this study will add to the gneeral understanding if multivitamin/multimineral formulas can improve nutrition status of older adults, and therefore have the capacity of altering markers of health.
