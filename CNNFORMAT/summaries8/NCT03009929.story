(fifthQuint)Validation Study of CLASSIC.

 Background Quantifiable evidence-based methods of defining and reporting complications are needed to improve patient safety in surgery.

 Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting postoperative complications, there are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for reporting intraoperative complications.

 The investigators developed and published a definition and classification for intraoperative complications within a Delphi study involving international interdisciplinary experts.

 The aim of this research project is to assess the validity and practicability of this newly derived classification system.

 Methods In 6 centres in Switzerland and 13 centres abroad, 2500 consecutive patients undergoing any type of inpatient surgery will be included in this prospective international multicentre cohort study.

 The primary endpoint corresponds to the risk-adjusted association between the most severe intraoperative complication classified according to CLASSIC and the most severe postoperative complication classified according to the most commonly used classification of postoperative complications developed by Clavien and Dindo.

 All observed patient-related intraoperative complications between skin incision and closure are considered as intraoperative complications.

 Expected results The investigators expect a high correlation between the most severe intra- and postoperative complications, even after adjustment for relevant confounders such as duration and complexity of the surgical procedure.

 Relevance Confirming a high correlation between intra- and postoperative complications, more attentive care could be provided to patients who suffered from a severe intraoperative complication.

 Additionally, providing an easy applicable and internationally validated classification system is a contribution to improve quality of perioperative health care and patient safety.

 Validation Study of CLASSIC@highlight

Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting postoperative complications, there are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for reporting intraoperative complications.

 The investigators developed a definition and CLASSification for Intraoperative Complications CLASSIC within a Delphi study involving international interdisciplinary experts.

 As both surgery and anaesthesia may be involved in complications in the perioperative period, all patient-related intraoperative complications occurring between skin incision and closure are considered in this reporting system.

 The aim of this international multicentre observational cohort study is to assess the validity and practicability of this newly derived classification system CLASSIC in patient undergoing an in-hospital surgical procedure.

 Providing an easy applicable and internationally validated classification system is a contribution to improve quality of health care and patient safety.
