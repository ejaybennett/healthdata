(fifthQuint)Effect of Patient Resilience on Return to Sport Post ACL Reconstruction Surgery.

 Meta-analysis of post ACL reconstruction return to sport suggests that despite approximately 90% of patients achieving successful outcomes in terms of objectively measurable knee function, only 63% return to their pre-injury sport participation rate.

 This leads one to question what factors other than knee function may contribute to such a discrepancy.

 Prior studies have shown psychological factors, such as fear of re-injury, can play in role in whether a patient returns to play.

 However, the role of patient resilience on recovery is less clear.

 This research will examine the effect of patient resilience on post-ACLR return to sport.

 The Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS), a proven method of assessing ability to recover from stressful situations, will be used to evaluate patient resilience.

 The role of resilience on recovery post shoulder surgery, as well as rehabilitation in post-operative orthopaedic geriatric patients has been examined; however, the effect of resilience on specifically ACLR return to sport has yet to be studied.

 This research will provide insight as to how to identify patients at high risk for not returning to sport, the first step in improving return to sport outcomes in ACL reconstruction patients.

 Effect of Patient Resilience on Return to Sport Post ACL Reconstruction Surgery@highlight

Despite the large majority of patients that undergo ACL reconstruction reporting successful outcomes in regard to tests of knee function, only about 2/3 return to their prior level or athletic activity after surgery.

 A large amount of research has been conducted investigating the effects of psychological factors on return to sports after ACL reconstruction; however, the specific role of resilience has yet to be solely analyzed.

 This study aims to determine the effect of variations in patient resilience on their return to sports after surgery.
