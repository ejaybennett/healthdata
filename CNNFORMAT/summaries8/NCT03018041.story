(secondQuint)The Long-term Effect of Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Renal Transplantation.

 The study is designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial of 174 renal transplant recipients.

 Patients will be randomized to oral supplementation of marine n-3 PUFA 2.

5 g / day or control in a 1:1 fashion.

 The primary endpoint is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate after 156 weeks in the treatment group compared with the control group.

 Secondary endpoints include the following variables: proteinuria, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting serum glucose / HbA1c, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, number of graft rejections and graft losses, and number of cardiovascular events and deaths.

 Patients from Akershus University Hospital will also participate in a sub-study, where renal graft biopsies will be performed to assess the degree of fibrosis and chronic allograft damage index (CADI) and markers of fibrosis.

 The Long-term Effect of Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Renal Transplantation@highlight

This is a long-term intervention study on the effects of marine n-3 PUFAs in renal transplantation.

 Our hypothesis is that patients treated with marine n-3 PUFA supplementation will have less decline in kidney transplant function compared to patients treated with placebo.
