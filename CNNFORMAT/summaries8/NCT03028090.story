(thirdQuint)Study to Assess Electrocardiogram Waveforms Produced Through the Utilization of the Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System.

 The SHERLOCK 3CG cent Tip Confirmation System (TCS) is a fully integrated magnetic tracking and ECG-based PICC tip confirmation technology.

 It was cleared by the FDA on March 19, 2012 and is indicated for use as an alternative to chest x-ray and fluoroscopy for PICC tip placement confirmation in adult patients.

 In order to further develop the SHERLOCK 3CG cent platform and simplify the PICC placement for the clinician, Bard Access Systems, Inc.

 developed a software package, MODUS, which can accurately define the maximum p-wave on an ECG waveform.

 This software provides visual and/or audio queues to notify the PICC placer of the location of the tip of the PICC relative to the cavoatrial junction of the patient.

 Subjects who required bedside PICC placement as standard of care and met eligibility criteria were enrolled.

 The software package was not used in the guidance or placement of the PICC tip.

 PICCs were placed per standard of care procedure using anthropometric measurements with the SHERLOCK 3CG cent TCS System.

 Data from the placements was sent back to Bard for analysis.

 Study to Assess Electrocardiogram Waveforms Produced Through the Utilization of the Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System@highlight

This study was to gather real-time ECG data through the use of the SHERLOCK 3CG cent Tip Confirmation System (TCS), an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) tip confirmation technology.

 The study was to promote the development of a software package (MODUS) that can accurately define the maximum P-wave on an ECG waveform.

 All study participants received PICCs as their standard of care.
