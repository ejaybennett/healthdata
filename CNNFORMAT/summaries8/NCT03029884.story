(fifthQuint)Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Chronic Neuropathic Pain.

 The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of DBS in a small cohort of patients with chronic pain refractory to conventional treatments.

 The study will involve the implantation of a neurostimulator, the Medtronic Activa PC+S device, to examine the efficacy of two modes of DBS.

 Open-loop DBS will provide stimulation based on a pre-set schedule, whereas closed-loop DBS will deliver stimulation based on brain activity associated with pain states.

 The goals of this study are to identify neurophysiological correlates of elevated pain states and find DBS parameters that disrupt pain-related brain activity and provide pain relief with little or no side effects.

 The efficacy of pain relief on subtypes of pain syndromes will also be studied.

 Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Chronic Neuropathic Pain@highlight

This study evaluates invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of three types of chronic neuropathic pain, i) Post Stroke pain syndrome ii) Phantom Limb pain and iii) Spinal Cord Injury Pain.

 Participants will be implanted with recording / stimulation electrodes in pain-related circuits of the brain.

 Relief of pain symptoms with stimulation will be studied in both groups.

 It is hypothesized that neural signals will correlate with pain states and that DBS can disrupt these pain states in both groups, perhaps with differences in underlying neural mechanisms for pain relief.
