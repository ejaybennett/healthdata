(firstQuint)Investigation the Effects of Stabilization Exercises on Pain, Disability and Activity of Pelvic Floor Muscles in Patients With Postpartum Lumbopelvic Pain.

 Pregnancy is a specific experience that leads to several physical changes in women's body and influence most aspects of their lives.

 Pregnancy and delivery can cause serious complications such as urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, fecal incontinence, and low back pain (LBP) that have negative effects on women's sexual, physical, social and psychological health.

 Based on Wu et al.

 systematic review, prevalence of pregnancy related low back pain (PLBP) during pregnancy and postpartum is 45% and 25% respectively.

 LBP is one of the most current causes of disability and sick leave after delivery.

Abnormal load transfer in the lumbopelvic region has been considered as one possible explanation to lumbopelvic pain.

The local stabilizing muscles, i.

e.

 the transversely oriented abdominal, diaphragm, the lumbar MF and the PFM Play an important role in load transfer in the lumbopelvic region.

so, we considered that an exercise program that addresses muscular dysfunction, such as lumbar stabilization exercise can improve motor pattern of local stabilizing muscles and can use in management of postpartum lumbopelvic pain.
