(thirdQuint)Prevention of Pneumothorax Following Endoscopic Valve Therapy in Patients With Severe Emphysema.

 Patient enrolment and data acquisition is to be carried out on a prospective basis.

 It is planned to enrol a total of 130 patients with advanced emphysema and low collateral ventilation.

 Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive modified medical care including a 48 bed rest or standard medical care following valve implantation.

 All patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg.

 Prevention of Pneumothorax Following Endoscopic Valve Therapy in Patients With Severe Emphysema@highlight

Endoscopic valve therapy is an effective therapy for patients with severe emphysema and low interlobar collateral ventilation.

 Although, valve therapy is a minimal-invasive treatment approach, it is associated with complications the most common of which is pneumothorax with a rate of 18-25%.

 Modifying post-operative medical care including bed rest for 48 hours after valve implantation may reduce the risk of post-interventional pneumothorax.
