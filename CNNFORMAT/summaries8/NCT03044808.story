(secondQuint)Investigation of the Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine Infusion on Postoperative Pain Treatment and Bowel Function in Robotic Bowel Surgery.

 Prospective double blind randomised controlled trial.

 The investigators are giving lidocaine IV or saline to 60 patients undergoing robot assisted colorectal surgery.

 Blinding and randomization is done by the hospital pharmacy.

 Both groups get otherwise the same treatment and a IV PCA (patient controlled administration) morphine pump for objectivisation of opioid consumption.
