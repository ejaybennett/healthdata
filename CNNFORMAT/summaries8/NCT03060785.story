(secondQuint)Finding the Right Tenofovir/Emtricitabine Regimen for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in Transgender Women.

 The investigators propose an open-label, steady-state study of TFV and FTC PK in blood and colon tissue in healthy TGW on feminizing hormones to be compared to healthy cis men, all at risk for HIV infection.

 Research participants will already have received eight days of TDF/FTC dosing.

 Evaluating TDF and FTC PK at steady-state is important as it reduces inter-individual variability since the rate of phosphorylation of TFV and FTC is highly variable, resulting in highly variable TFV-DP and Emtricitabine-Triphosphate (FTC-TP) PK among individuals in the first day and during rise to steady-state.

 Finding the Right Tenofovir/Emtricitabine Regimen for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in Transgender Women@highlight

This is an open-label, steady-state study of Tenofovir (TFV) and Emtricitabine (FTC) pharmacokinetics (PK) in transgender women taking feminizing hormones.

 Half of the participants will be transgender women on feminizing hormones, the other half will be male volunteers not taking any hormone therapy.
