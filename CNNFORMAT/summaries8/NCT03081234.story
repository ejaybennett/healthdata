(secondQuint)Adjuvant Ribociclib With Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor+/HER2- Intermediate Risk Early Breast Cancer.

 While adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) is effective in reducing risk of recurrence in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), recurrences are still common, especially in patients with unfavorable clinical, pathological and/or molecular features.

 Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity when added to ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of ribociclib to standard adjuvant ET on invasive disease-free survival in patients with HR+, HER2- intermediate-risk EBC.

This is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ribociclib with endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, intermediate risk breast cancer.
