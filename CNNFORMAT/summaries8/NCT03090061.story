(secondQuint)Reliability of Light Induced Fluorescence Intraoral Camera Versus Visual-Tactile Method in Assessment of Marginal Integrity of Resin Composite Restorations: Diagnostic Invivo Study.

 Each patient should have at least one resin composite restoration.

 The restoration will be evaluated by two diagnostic methods.

 Each examiner will record the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment method and the fluorescent-aided identification method.

 The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror, FDI probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence intraoral camera then the reliability of each diagnostic tool will be assessed.
