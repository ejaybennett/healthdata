(firstQuint)BCMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor Expressing T Cells in Multiple Myeloma.

 Primary Objectives 1.

 To determine the feasibility ad safety of BCMA CAR-T cells in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

 2.

 To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of BCMA CAR-T cells.

 3.

 To access the efficacy of BCMA CAR-T cells in patients with multiple myeloma.

 Secondary Objectives 1.

 To assess the bone marrow and tumor migration of BCMA CAR-T cells.

 2.

 To investigate the tumor killing capability of BCMA CAR-T cells in vitro 3.

 To investigate the possibility of host immune response to the mouse derived BCMA scFv, and evaluate its correlation to CAR-T persistence.

 4.

 To correlate the subsets and differentiation of BCMA CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor efficacy.
