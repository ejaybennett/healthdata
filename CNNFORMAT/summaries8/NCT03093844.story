(secondQuint)Haploidentical CD34+ Selected Cells Combined With Single Unit Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant for Treatment of High-risk Hematologic Disorders.

 In this clinical protocol, the CliniMACS(R) CD34 Reagent System will be used for processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) from an allogeneic, HLA-haploidentical, related donor to obtain a CD34+ cell-enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution.

 The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo one apheresis to collect CD34+ stem cells.

 The products will be cryopreserved until the time of transplantation.

 Recipients with hematologic disorders who require transplant will receive a standard conditioning regimen and will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+ cells that have been positively selected and T-cell depleted following G-CSF mobilization combined with a single UCB unit.
