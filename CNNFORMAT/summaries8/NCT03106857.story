 Patients suffering from constipation due to drugs, disabled patients, and those who had undergone any abdominal surgery during the intervention or those who failed to complete the study protocol were also excluded.

 All participants provided a written informed consent before enrolling in the study.

 Study design and intervention: Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups.

 Group A included 62 women who were following a suggested protocol of physical activity and a low caloric diet in addition to the routine standard care for constipation.
