(secondQuint)National Early Warning Score and D-dimer to Identify Medical Patients at Low Risk of 30-day Mortality.

 Large increases in emergency admissions are raising concerns about whether all admissions are necessary.

 If there was a fast and reliable system that could be used to determine the risk of all medical patients, many low-risk patients could be safely returned to primary care or outpatient follow-up clinics.

 The investigators wish to determine, if the combination of the National Early Warning Score and plasma D-dimer levels can be used to identify patients at low risk of mortality within 30 days in an unselected group of medical patients presenting to a Danish Emergency Department.

 This is a prospective observational study that will be performed on adult medical patients referred to the Emergency Department of a Danish hospital to be assessed for possible admission.

 The study will be performed in the Emergency Department of Hospital of South West Jutland in the region of Southern Denmark.

The aim is to determine if the National Early Warning Score combined with plasma D-dimer levels can be used in risk stratification of acutely ill medical patients presenting to a Danish Emergency Department.

 The investigators wish to identify patients at low risk of mortality within 30 days.
