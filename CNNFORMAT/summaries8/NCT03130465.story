(thirdQuint)Aripiprazole Once-monthly Versus Daily Oral Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment in Patients With Recent-onset Schizophrenia.

 This is an observational, non-interventional study that will include two cohorts of patients with schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment during a schizophrenia-related hospitalisation: patients who initiated maintenance treatment with aripiprazole once-monthly and patients who initiated maintenance treatment with any daily oral atypical antipsychotic.

 The date of maintenance treatment initiation will be considered the index date.

 Baseline data will be collected immediately after the inclusion of the patient in the study (including retrospective data from the index date to the date of informed consent and from the past 5 years).

 From the date of the inclusion of the patient in the study, each patient will be prospectively followed up until discontinuation of the maintenance treatment of interest and up to a maximum of 12 months since the index date.

 Data will be collected from the patient file and from information obtained during routine visits scheduled according to clinical practice.
