(thirdQuint)Surgical vs.

 Lifestyle in Obese Older Adults.

 The investigators propose a 1-year pilot feasibility study to examine the comparative effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy compared to an intensive lifestyle intervention of a high protein low carbohydrate, hypocaloric weight loss diet combined with exercise training among older adults aged 60-75.

 For pragmatic and ethical reasons, the investigators are employing a nonrandomized design.

 The investigators will recruit 10 older patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy and match, recruit, and enroll 1-2 subjects to the lifestyle intervention for each surgical subject.

 The investigators will assess physical function, weight loss, body composition, bone density, QOL and adverse events/health utilization at baseline and 6 and 12 months.
