(thirdQuint)Hypomethylating Properties of Freeze-dried Black Raspberries (BRB) in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

 STUDY RATIONALE: Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine and decitabine are FDA approved therapies for MDS patients.

 Approximately 50% of patients respond to HMAs.

 In addition, HMAs have improved survival and quality of life of patients with MDS when compared to other therapies.

 Preclinical research shows black raspberries (BRBs) have hypomethylating effects in the colon, blood, spleen, and bone marrow of mice treated with BRBs.

 The aim of this study is to evaluate the hypomethylating properties of BRBs in patients with MDS monthly for 12 weeks of BRB supplementation.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential hypomethylating effects of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRBs) in the peripheral blood of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after 12 weeks of BRB administration.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: 1.

 To evaluate the toxicity of BRBs in patients with MDS.

 2.

 To evaluate the hematological response according to modified IWG criteria (Appendix 2) in patients with MDS regardless of the initial blood count.

This is a phase II, single-group pilot study to evaluate efficacy and pharmacokinetics.

 This study's overarching aim is to evaluate the systemic effects of black raspberries in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

 Twenty-one patients with MDS will be treated with 25 gm (2x/day) of BRB powder taken orally.
