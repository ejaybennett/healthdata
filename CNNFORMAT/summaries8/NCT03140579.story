(thirdQuint)Effect of PEEP on Lung Recruitment and Homogeneity Over Time in Moderate to Severe ARDS.

 Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a well-recognised problem of ventilation in patients with ARDS, and is currently treated with lung-protective ventilation, which limits tidal volumes and airway pressures by applying higher levels of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

 However, it is not known whether higher levels of PEEP increases recruitment and homogeneity of ventilation within the lungs.

 APRV is a mode of inverse ventilation, where high levels of PEEP are maintained with brief releases of pressure, and has been proposed as an appropriate method of ventilation in patients with ARDS.

 This study will assess homogeneity of ventilation and recruitment in 15 patients before APRV is started, and 30, 60 and 120 mins after commencing APRV.

 It will do this using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), nitrogen wash in/wash out technique, and lung strain.

 Effect of PEEP on Lung Recruitment and Homogeneity Over Time in Moderate to Severe ARDS@highlight

This study evaluates the effect of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) on lung homogeneity and recruitment in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 It will do this by comparing the homogeneity of ventilation and recruitment prior to a patient being ventilated on APRV, and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after starting APRV.
