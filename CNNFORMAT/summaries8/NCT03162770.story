(fifthQuint)Mindfulness Meditation Practice During Hemodialysis.

 Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects thousands of people in the world, regardless of gender, race and age.

 CKD requires dialysis or renal transplant.

 In the case of dialysis, cardiovascular and infectious events adversely impact the survival and quality of life despite technological advances.

 Recently, brain-renal interaction has emerged as a key aspect for understanding the neurological disorders-related to CKD, such as cerebrovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, and autonomic, sensory and motor neuropathies.

 In addition, patients on chronic hemodialysis develop sleep disorders, like insomnia and central apnea, restless leg syndrome, depression, anxiety and stress.

 Mindfulness meditation practice has been reported to positively affect cardiovascular parameters, since that practice contributes to the decrease in blood pressure levels and premature heart beats occurrence through sympathetic nerve modulation, which collectively may lead to improve the quality of life.

 Objectives: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation practice in patients on chronic hemodialysis, in order to verify if this training can improve symptoms of depression, stress, quality of life and sleep quality.

 Methods: fifty patients will be separated in two groups, twenty five each group, half of them in the control group (CG) and the other half in the intervention group (IG).

 The IG will be enrolled in the meditation protocol, for 12 weeks, 3 days a week during the hemodialysis session, while the CG will wait.

 Then after the evaluations, the CG will receive the intervention of meditation, while the IG will not receive any intervention.

 The groups will be evaluate before, 3-and 6-month follow-up periods.

 We will apply the following instruments: ICED (Index of coexistent diseases), KDQOL (Kidney Disease Quality of Life), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), PSS (Perceived Stress Scale), MAAS (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) and SCS (Self-Compassion Scale).

 Mindfulness Meditation Practice During Hemodialysis@highlight

This protocol of meditation is based on mindfulness program proposes to train meditation during the hemodialysis session.

 The investigators hypothesize that this program offered during hemodialysis session may promote well-being, reduce symptoms of stress and depression reported by the patients, which ultimately may improve biochemical parameters resulting from better adherence to treatment.

 Objectives: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation practice in patients on chronic hemodialysis, in order to verify if this training can improve symptoms of depression, stress, quality of life and sleep disturbances.

 Methods: fifty patients will be separated in two groups, twenty five each group, half of them in the control group (CG) and the other half to the intervention group (IG).

 The patients will be evaluated pre- and pos-protocol.
