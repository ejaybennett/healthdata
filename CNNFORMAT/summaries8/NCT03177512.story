(secondQuint)LYNX: A Novel Mobile App to Support Linkage to HIV/STI Testing PrEP for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men.

 Using the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills (IMB) model, we have developed LYNX, a highly interactive mobile app to promote accurate risk perception and increase HIV/STI testing and linkage to PrEP among young men who have sex with men (YMSM).

 Key components of the app include Sex Pro (a personalized HIV risk score), a sex diary to facilitate accurate data collection; HIV/STI testing information and reminders; access to home HIV/STI testing options; a geospatial-based locator of HIV/STI testing sites and PrEP clinics; PrEP information and videos; and online PrEP navigation.

 This study is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
