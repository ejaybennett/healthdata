(firstQuint)Study of Rivaroxaban for CeREbral Venous Thrombosis.

 SECRET is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will assess the safety of rivaroxaban, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), compared with standard-of-care (unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin with transition to warfarin [INR 2.

0-3.

0], or continued low molecular-weight heparin) for cerebral venous thrombosis.

 Recruitment will occur at 15 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 3 years.

 Three hundred and forty-eight adult patients within 14 days of diagnosis of symptomatic cerebral venous thrombosis will be randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg daily versus standard of care (regimen at the discretion of the local investigator in keeping with AHA/ASA guidelines).

 Patients will be followed for 1 year.

 The feasibility of recruitment will also be tested.

 Alongside and separate from the trial, we will establish a parallel registry of approximately 200 cerebral venous thrombosis patients who do not meet criteria for the trial (i.

e.

, informed consent not given, pregnant or breastfeeding women, contraindication to direct oral anticoagulation).

 Registry participants will receive standard of care and complete the same schedule of follow-up procedures as participants enrolled in the trial.

 This registry component will allow us to capture data from a representative cerebral venous thrombosis population by increasing rates of enrolment for patients who would otherwise be ineligible.
