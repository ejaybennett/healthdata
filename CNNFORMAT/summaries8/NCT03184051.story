(secondQuint)Diagnostic Performance of Ultrasound Imaging Technique for Femoral Condyle Cartilage Evaluation and Osteoarthritis.

 Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease of synovial joint becoming more frequent with age.

 Among techniques have been used to diagnose and classify the severity of knee OA, the imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography (US), provide physical quantitative informations for better understanding and assessing of the pathology of the knee joint.

 The present study aim to investigate the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography for femoral condyle cartilage evaluation using MRI and histology analysis as reference tools.

 To validate this approach, evaluations are conducted to determine, whether the UltraSound Speed Of Sound (US-SOS) propagation is associated with the variation of the arthrosis stage, in order to improve the diagnosis of the surgeon.

 For this purpose, measurements are conducted using selected human cartilage samples with different stage of OA (early stage and advanced stage).

 This research is the first "preclinical" study of a new unlabelled medical device developed by Cartimage Medical SAS.

 Cartilage is a prospective, monocentric, unrandomized and uncontrolled study.

 This study doesn't modify the medical care of the patient.

This study investigates the potential of the ultrasound imaging technique to diagnose the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA).

 In parallel, measurements will also be conducted using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and histology analysis as reference tools.
