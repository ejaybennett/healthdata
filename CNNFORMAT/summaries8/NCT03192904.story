(thirdQuint)Comparison of Energy Instruments and Stapling Device to Dissect Intersegmental Plane in Segmentectomy.

 Lung cancer has been one of the most serious life-threatening diseases of human society.

 It has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide among all the malignant tumors.

 Due to the popularization of low-dose CT and other means of examination, more and more patients with lung cancer are detected in the early phase of disease.

 Anatomical segementectomy is one of the standard surgical procedures for these small pulmonary nodules or ground glass opacity (GGO), which are clinically highly suspected or puncture confirmed early lung cancer lesions.

 Dissection of the intersegmental plane in segementectomy is a difficulty that have puzzled thoracic surgeons for decades because of the complicated anatomic relationship and variations, along with lack of boundary between pulmonary segments.

 There are two main approaches in the dissection of intersegmental plane: stapling devices and energy instrument separation.

 However, only a few retrospective studies focused on the perioperative outcomes of these two approaches in segmentectomy, not to mention in robot assisted segmentectomy, and there has been no definitive conclusion about which method is better.

 So the investigators want to conduct a prospective study, trying to figure out this problem.

 The investigators set incidence rate of postoperative complications as their primary endpoint.

 According to their calculation, a total of 136 patients will be enrolled (each group has 68 patients).
