(thirdQuint)MapTrek to Increase Activity Among Patients at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes.

 This study will randomize participants to 2 groups, an intervention group that will receive a Fitbit and MapTrek, and a control group that will receive a Fitbit only.

 This study has 3 specific aims.

 Aim 1- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek walk more than the control patients.

 Aim 2- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek generally walk at a faster pace during the day than control patients.

 Aim 3- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek have less sedentary time during the day than the control patients.

 We expect to collect sufficient data to demonstrate the effectiveness of MapTrek, our prototype m-health tool, as an intervention to increase physical activity, heighten intensity of activity, and reduce sedentary behavior among a cohort of patients at risk for type 2 diabetes.

 MapTrek to Increase Activity Among Patients at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes@highlight

The overarching objective of our work is to provide an inexpensive and scalable m-health tool to increase both volume and intensity of physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes.

 The objective of this study is to pilot test MapTrek, a text-messaging based intervention.
