(thirdQuint)Real-time Glaucoma Medication Adherence.

 Adherence to topical medications to treat glaucoma remains sub optimal; however, our understanding of this behavior remains limited due to biased measures of medication use.

 The Kali Drop device is a potential improvement in our ability to capture medication use in patients using dropper bottles by precisely capturing the amount dispensed in real-time.

 Moreover, such technology creates data that can be leveraged into driving behavior change using connected mobile technology in order to improve adherence and, ultimately, health outcomes.

 While evidence suggests that reminders may improve adherence to glaucoma medications, the power of doing so using real-time data has yet to be explored.

 This study will compare simple monitoring of patients to those who are being monitored and who receive reminder messages when the system determines one is necessary due to a missed dose.

 Real-time Glaucoma Medication Adherence@highlight

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of real-time data collected on patients taking topical medication to treat glaucoma.

 Patients will be randomized to two groups, the first of which will only use the study device to take their medication, while the second will use the study device and receive on-demand reminder messages, when necessary.
