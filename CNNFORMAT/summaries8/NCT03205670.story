(fifthQuint)Tissue-engineered Construct Based on Buccal Mucosa Cells and Matrix From Collagen and Polylactoglycolide Fibers.

 Treatment of urethral strictures longer than 2 cm is an actual clinical challenge.

 In this case, the common method is replacement surgery using a buccal mucosa graft.

 However, the main disadvantage of this method is associated with limited donor resources and donor site morbidity.

 The aim of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with anterior urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct.

 The construct consists of autologous buccal mucosa cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing polylactoglycolide fibers.

 Patients will be followed up for 5 years within this study.

 The follow-up regimen includes retrograde and pericatheter urethrography, voiding cystourethrography, uroflowmetry, biopsy, and quality of life monitoring.

 Telephone follow-up will take place in between these assessments.

 The data obtained from this study will have practical implications for the urethral stricture treatment and will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine.

 Tissue-engineered Construct Based on Buccal Mucosa Cells and Matrix From Collagen and Polylactoglycolide Fibers@highlight

This study investigates safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with anterior urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct based on autologous buccal mucosa cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing polylactoglycolide fibers.

 This is a single arm study with no control.

 Success will be assessed via objective and subjective methods; complications will be tallied in a standardized fashion.

 Outcomes will be measured at five years.
