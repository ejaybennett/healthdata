(thirdQuint)SALT Study (Switching to the Administration of Lithium Slow -Release Treatment).

 This is a phase IV, randomized, open, parallel groups, multicentre, prospective study.

 The main purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the change in the lithium induced tremor when switching from Lithium Immediate Release formulation (Carbolithium(R)) to Lithium Sulphate prolonged-release formulation (Lithiofor(R)) in Bipolar Disorder patients, poorly tolerant to the Lithium Immediate Release treatment.

 The primary end point will be the reduction of the lithium induced tremor.

 Patients in treatment with lithium carbonate immediate-release (Carbolithium(R)), will be enrolled in the study and, after 1 week of maintaining treatment, will be randomly switched to Lithium prolonged-release formulation or will continue the previous therapy.

 SALT Study (Switching to the Administration of Lithium Slow -Release Treatment)@highlight

The aim of the study is to assess the tolerability, efficacy and safety of a new lithium sulphate prolonged release formulation (Lithiofor(R)) in patients affected by Bipolar Disorder poor tolerant to lithium immediate-release treatment in terms of lithium-induced tremor when switched from therapy with a lithium carbonate immediate release formulation (Carbolithium(R)) to a new lithium sulphate prolonged release formulation (Lithiofor(R)).
