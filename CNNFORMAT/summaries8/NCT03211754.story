(secondQuint)Anthropometric Measures and Anti-inflammatory Markers by a PUFAs Enriched Diet.

 The study consists of a diet-intervention in a single group under-free-living conditions.

 The diet was enriched with 15g of almonds and 15g of walnuts per day for eight weeks, supplied directly to the patient by the researcher.

 This amounts of walnuts and almonds contain polyunsaturated fatty acids of approximately 2.

02g of omega 3 (alpha-linolenic acid) and 11.

1g of omega 6 (linoleic acid) mostly.

 In a period of 14 months, the investigators recruited forty-eight sedentary subjects of 30 to 50 years old, and body mass index between 30 and 34.

9 kg/m2, without evidence of chronic degenerative, infectious or neoplastic diseases, neither medication nor actually dietary treatment, and a physical level of exercise 20% of the amount indicated by the researcher.

 The investigators recorded the anthropometric measures, body composition, and measured serum glucose, lipid profile, insulin, lipocalin 2, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and fatty acids profile, which were analyzed at the baseline and after dietary intervention.

In this work, the investigators report the effects of consume of 15g walnuts and 15g almonds for 8 week on weight, waist and hip circumferences, body mass index, fat mass, serum LDL-cholesterol adiponectin, lipocalin-2 concentration and fatty acids profile.
