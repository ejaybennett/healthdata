(secondQuint)Oxandrolone in Healthy Adults: A Relative Bioavailability Study.

 The results of this study will provide data regarding the relative bioavailability of a novel preparation of oxandrolone in MCT oil, which will allow dosing in neonates and small infants.

 This pilot study will provide information to design a larger multicenter study of neonates undergoing surgery for complex congenital heart disease.
