(firstQuint)Expanding the Pool in Orthotopic Heart Transplantation.

 The investigators are proposing a proof of concept study in which positive donors will be used for HCV negative patients.

 Following heart transplantation patients will undergo HCV antibody, virus PCR, and liver function testing.

 Recipients whom test positive for HCV viremia for 2 consecutive tests at any point will complete 12 weeks of Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy.

 This initial study would enroll 100 patients and utilize donors that are young, otherwise healthy, with normal biventricular heart function whom are Hepatitis C antibody positive but Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAT) negative (HCV Ab+/NAT-).

 The recipients would be limited to those patients who have previously consented to receive a high risk heart transplant, consented to participant in this study, and who are physiologically optimized for transplantation (e.

g.

, low risk for heart transplantation).
