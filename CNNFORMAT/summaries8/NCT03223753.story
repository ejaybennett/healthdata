(thirdQuint)Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention in Improving Long Term Health in Children and Adolescents With Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in First Remission.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on fitness among children and adolescents following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on markers of cardiometabolic health among children and adolescents following treatment for ALL.

 II.

 To evaluate the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on physical activity, quality of life, fatigue, and school attendance among children and adolescents following treatment for ALL.

 III.

 To determine if the effect of an interactive web-based physical activity intervention on markers of cardiometabolic health is mediated by changes in fitness among children and adolescents following treatment for ALL.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive educational handouts about physical activity and are encouraged to increase physical activity to at least 420 minutes per week.

 Patients wear Sqord activity monitor daily and upload data at least once a week to the Sqord website.

 Patients also access the limited version of Sqord website to get basic information related to their physical activity for 6 months.

 ARM II: Patients receive educational handouts about physical activity and are encouraged to increase physical activity to at least 420 minutes per week.

 Patients wear Sqord activity monitor daily and upload data at least once a week to the Sqord website.

 Patients also access the full version of the interactive-reward based Sqord website to see their activity, earn activity points, see other Sqord player's activity, and interact with other Sqord members for 6 months.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 and 48 weeks.

 Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention in Improving Long Term Health in Children and Adolescents With Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in First Remission@highlight

This randomized clinical trial studies how well web-based physical activity intervention works in improving long term health in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia that shows a decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms.

 Regular physical activity after receiving treatment for cancer may help to maintain a healthy weight and improve energy levels and overall health.
