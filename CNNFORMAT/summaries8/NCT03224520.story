(thirdQuint)Smoker-to-Smoker (S2S) Peer Marketing and Messaging to Disseminate Tobacco Interventions.

 S2S has many innovations that are designed to utilize the power of peers and social networks for dissemination.

 These include: Peer recruitment: Tools to facilitate smokers' recruiting their peers to increase Decide2Quit access; and a recommender computer tailored health communication (recommender CTHC): a Complex machine learning algorithm (recommender systems) that uses smokers' feedback (explicit and implicit) in the current and prior studies to adapt its selection of messages to smokers.

 Using a 2*2 factorial design, the study will compare individually and collectively the enhancements (recruitment, use, and effectiveness) offered by the S2S functions over the standard version of Decide2Quit (online recruitment and standard CTHC), an active comparison group.
