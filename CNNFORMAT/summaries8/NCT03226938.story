(fifthQuint)Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT), Exam 1.

 Public interest in nutrition is at the forefront of wellness and food culture, and the number of followers of various popular diets has grown in the last decade.

 These popular diets span the spectrum from vegan/vegetarian to low-carb/Paleo.

 Compared to typical American dietary patterns, which are high in added sugar and fat, these emerging diet patterns may offer improved dietary quality due to a reduction in added sugars and refined carbohydrates.

 Observational cohort studies have associated improved diet quality and health benefits with various types of plant-based diets, and randomized controlled trials have shown these diets to be beneficial for reducing body weight and cardiometabolic risk.

 Randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals following low-carb and Paleo diets.

 In spite of these documented health benefits, there is limited intervention and longitudinal data on followers of popular diets.

 Evidence on successful adherence to such diets is further limited and may be of interest.

 The Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT) Recruitment Feasibility Survey (FS), conducted in the summer of 2015, demonstrated interest on the part of popular diet followers in participating in nutrition research.

 This planning survey identified over 7,000 individuals expressing interest in being contacted for a future study on dietary patterns, and the ADAPT study exam 1 will aim to recruit from this pool of participants.

 To date, research has identified psychobiological, cultural, social, and environmental factors that enable individuals to adhere to weight loss and other diets over the long-term (2+ years).

 These adherence factors include habit formation, social support, a supportive environment, self-efficacy including knowledge of nutrition, and motivation.

 However, no observational study has recruited individuals following a variety of self-identified diets to examine (1) the actual nutrient composition of popular dietary patterns compared to targeted intakes, (2) the association of predictors of adherence identified in weight-loss research to these specific dietary patterns chosen for personal preference, and (3) which of these factors are most prevalent among self-identified long-term followers and how this may differ across diet groups.

 The question of how individuals can successfully adhere to a variety of healthier dietary patterns is of highest public health importance because of the growing burden of disease risk in the US.

 The specific aims of this study are as follows: 1) Compare the mean nutrient composition, diet quality, and degree of adherence among US-based, long-term followers (>2 years) of popular diets to determine how closely individuals met the prescribed targeted nutrient profiles; 2) Compare the self-reported body weight and BMI across diet patterns; 3) Assess the prevalence of predictors of dietary adherence (psychobiological, cultural, social, economic, and environmental) across diet patterns.

 Recruitment will target a variety of populations who choose to eat less common or lesser-studied diets, with a trend towards avoiding processed foods and added sugars, such as: raw vegan, vegan, vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, whole food, DASH, gluten-free, dairy-free, Mediterranean, Paleo, Weston Price, or diets specifically for weight loss.

 Participants will be recruited from a pool of subjects who expressed interest in future study involvement as a part of the ADAPT FS.

 In addition, the investigators will continue to recruit additional participants electronically, through a variety of online resources that may include affinity-based email lists, social media (Facebook, Twitter), referrals from family and/or friends in the FS, and personal communications from study investigators.

 Survey Questionnaires: The investigators will administer a demographics and lifestyle questionnaire, supplement use questionnaire, and a variety of previously validated questionnaires hosted online in Qualtrics.

 Questionnaires on demographics, supplement use, diet choice, diet history, socioeconomic status, food access/availability, cost, convenience, and motivation (informed by the FS) have been created in Qualtrics.

 The following previously validated questionnaires were also created in Qualtrics: the Nutrition Self-Efficacy Scale, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, Power of Food Scale, Yale Food Addiction Scale, Social Support and Eating Habits Survey, Self-Report Habit Index,International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Index.

 The investigators will assess dietary intakes using the following: (1) the Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQ II), a web-based food frequency questionnaire from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and (2) the web-based 24 hour recall questionnaire the ASA24, also from NCI.

 The ASA24 will be administered, unannounced, to a subset of participants to try to minimize instances of participants altering their diet, either intentionally or unintentionally, as a result of knowing about an upcoming 24-hour recall questionnaire.

 The questionnaires will take approximately 3-4 hours in total to complete but will be staggered over the course of 6-12 weeks to reduce respondent burden.

 A total of 17 questionnaires will be administered, staggered in batches of 1-3 questionnaires at a time, resulting in participants being contacted a minimum of 10 times over the course of approximately 6-12 weeks.

 Participants who miss or do not complete questionnaires may be contacted more frequently with reminder emails.

 Participants will provide electronic consent prior to beginning the survey by reading a disclosure and answering questions aimed at capturing all elements required by the Tufts University Health Sciences IRB for consent.

 Analysis: The primary analyses are described below; however, additional, related analyses may be conducted depending on the outcome of the primary analyses.

 Mean dietary data will be collected for all participants using (1) the ASA24 24-hour recall and (2) Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ), as described above.

 The DHQ data will enable a comparative measure of individual dietary intake.

 NCI auto-analyzes food and nutrient data and delivers the analyzed datasets to researchers.

 Individual adherence will be calculated as the average percent difference in macronutrient intake compared to recommended intakes using the DHQ data and the 7-day meal plan data.

 The percent difference in macronutrient intake compared to recommended intakes of the diet will be calculated using information from books and public figure recommendations identified in the FS.

 This method of defining adherence has been previously used in the A to Z Weight Loss Study.

 For example, among Paleo followers, three of the most frequently cited sources of nutrition and cooking information in the FS were the books It Starts with Food, The Paleo Solution, and The Primal Blueprint.

 All three of these books contain meal plans and recipes.

 The target nutrient intakes from each book will be calculated using 7-day meal plans and then averaged to determine the targets against which participants will be compared to determine adherence.

 Percent of energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake for each individual will be calculated and analyzed for average deviation from targeted intakes, as in the A to Z Weight Loss Study, using the Mahalanobis distance equation which measures the similarity between actual and targeted conditions.

 Perfect adherence will be defined as 100% consistency with 0% deviation from targeted intakes.

 For example, if Paleo targets were 25% carbohydrate, 35% protein, and 40% fat, and a participant had 35% carbohydrate, 30% protein, and 35% fat, they would achieve an average adherence score of 93 (due to the 10% deviation for carbohydrate and 5% deviation for protein and fat targets).

 Participants will be categorized into quartiles based on their total adherence; those with the lowest deviance will be considered the most adherent.

 Participants will also be categorized into predetermined scoring groups of 100-90, 90-75, 75-50, and <50.

 Diet quality will be assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI).

 Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT), Exam 1@highlight

Understanding the impact of dietary patterns, exercise, and behavior change in the prevention of disease is paramount to improving the health and well-being of future generations and economies.

 A gap in the research is the lack of data on factors that predict successful behavior change for sustained dietary practices chosen for health or other personal reasons.

 To date, no survey exists that was designed to target persons following a wide range of popular dietary patterns (e.

g.

, Paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, gluten-free, etc.

).

 These dietary patterns, which offer great variation in macronutrient composition, are unique and unexplored in other similar surveys to date, making their examination innovative.

 Adhering to Dietary Approaches for Personal Taste (ADAPT) will be the first large cohort of its type that is focused on adherence to popular dietary patterns, providing the opportunity to better understand how individuals can be supported to successfully maintain a specific dietary practice, and, in the long-term, how these practices may influence parameters of healthy aging.
