(fifthQuint)Interactive Video Game Responses in Cystic Fibrosis.

 Cardiopulmonary exercise test: The test will be performed according to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society and American College of Chest Physician.

The variables to be measured includes maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal ventilation (Vemax), respiratory quotient (RQ), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), subjective levels of dyspnea and fatigue in the legs (modified BORG scale), pulse oxygen (VO2/HR) and maximal heart rate (HRmax).

 During the test, the individuals will be asked to walk for 2 minutes to adapt to the treadmill, with a speed of 3 km/h and without inclination.

 After that, there will be increments in the speed of 0.

5 Km/h, every minute, with a fixed slope of 3%, until the end of the test.

 All individuals will be encouraged to keep the pace until signs of exhaustion or limiting symptoms appear (dyspnea, leg pain and/or dizziness).

 To be considered a maximal test, at least three of the following criteria should be observed: exhaustion or inability to maintain the required speed, RQ>1.

10, maximal achieved HR>85% of the estimated HR (formula: 220- Age) and the presence of a plateau in the VO2max.

 Interactive Video Games: Participants will use Nintendo Wii for 10 minutes and then use Xbox One for 10 minutes, taking a 10-minute rest between one console and another.

 During the two video games, patients will use a Neoprene mask to collect gases, including maximal oxygen (VO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), maximal ventilation (VEmax), respiratory quotient (RQ) and the metabolic equivalents for oxygen (VE/VO2) and for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2).

 In addition, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), subjective levels of dyspnea and fatigue in the legs (modified BORG scale), pulse oxygen (VO2/HR) and maximal heart rate (HRmax) before and after Intervention will be collected.

 Accelerometer: All participants will use an accelerometer while playing in the interactive video games.

 This equipment will be used on the left side of the waist.

 The results of the physical activity variables will be expressed as mean counts/min, as a mean indicator of the intensity of physical activity.

 In addition, the time spent in activities according to their intensity will be classified as sedentary (100 counts) and moderate to vigorous (>2296 counts).

 Scales: In the OMNI scale, individuals point out on a scale of 0 to 10 the fatigue level, where 0 is very easy and 10 is very difficult.

Also, the level of satisfaction will be evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 represents no satisfaction and 5 much satisfaction.

 Interactive Video Game Responses in Cystic Fibrosis@highlight

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that affects multiple systems, however, the accumulation of secretion in the airways contributes to the fact that pulmonary complications are the main responsible for the high rates of morbidity and mortality.

 Physical exercise can be an important component in the treatment of these patients, and modalities such as Nintendo Wii and Xbox One stand out as feasible and innovative methods that can contribute to increase adherence to rehabilitation.

 Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the cardiorespiratory responses during a maximal exercise test with the use of Nintendo Wii and Xbox One in patients with CF and healthy individuals.

 Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CF, aged from 6 to 30 years old and in stable clinical conditions will be included.

 For healthy individuals, those who are considered healthy from the application of a health questionnaire and also aged from 6 to 30 years old will be included.

 Patients in both groups with cardiopathies, musculoskeletal diseases, neurological diseases or signs of pulmonary exacerbation will be excluded.

 Participants will complete a questionnaire to assess their level of physical activity.

 Afterwards, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) will be performed (visit 1), followed by the use of video games (visit 2).

 The video game will be practiced using a Nintendo Wii and a Xbox One (10 minutes each).

 A rest of 10 minutes will be provided between the use of each video game.

 During the interactive games, patients will use an accelerometer to assess the level of physical activity.

 In parallel to this, healthy subjects will be invited to perform the same tests in two visits.

 To evaluate the perception of fatigue, the OMNI scale will be used.

 In addition, individuals will be asked to evaluate their level of satisfaction after each game.
