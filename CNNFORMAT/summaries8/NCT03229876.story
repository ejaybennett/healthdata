(secondQuint)Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Universal CD19-CART.

 Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) is a kind of gene engineered T cells by transferring an artificial antigen binding receptor.

 This kind of T cells gains the ability to recognize antigen expressing tumor cells and initiate killing process in a HLA-independent way.

 CD19 is the specific cellular marker of B lineage acute leukemia (B-ALL), thus CD19-CART will be efficient in treating B lineage ALL.

Universal CD19-CART is a kind of "off-the-shelf" product originated from health donor's PBMC.

 The investigators have optimized CRISPR/gRNA electroporation to achieve a high gene disruption efficiency in T cells for both TCR- and MHC-1.

 T cells from health donor have a better proliferation ability and anti-tumor efficacy than the patients.

Besides, enough number of CART cells can be produced from one donor to meet the need of dozens of enrolled patients.

 This kind of universal CD19-CART has been tested in animal experiment for its GVHD satefy and anti-tumor efficacy.

 Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Universal CD19-CART@highlight

Universal CART(U-CART) has a great advantage for its allogeneic T cell resource.

 After gene disruption of TCR and HLA-1, U-CART will exempt from immunologic rejection by the receptor, and won't initiate GVHD.

 Thus U-CART would act as a "off-the-shelf" product for the treatment of tumor.
