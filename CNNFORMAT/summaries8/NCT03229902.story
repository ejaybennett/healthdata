(secondQuint)Mantra Meditation in Subjects That Have Chronically Impaired Attention After Stroke.

 The study is non-concurrent, multiple-baseline, across-subjects, single-case research design (SCRD).

 The central hypothesis is that mantra meditation (independent variable) will be associated with improvement on 1 or more tests of behaviorally measured sustained attention (dependent variable).

 The mantra in this study is the syllable "um" and is not assigned any spiritual, religious, or affective meaning.

 The mantra is repeated aloud together by the subject and the PI for a duration of 30 minutes in each session.

 This procedure constitutes meditation for the purposes of this study.

 There are 9 session of meditation (3 times per week for 3 weeks).

 Attention is measured in each of these sessions as well as in 3 separate testing sessions that precede the intervention period.
