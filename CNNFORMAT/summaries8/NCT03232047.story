(secondQuint)Computerized Cognitive Training for MCI.

 Introduction: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition characterized of a reduction in memory and/or other cognitive processes that are insufficiently severe to be diagnosed as dementia, but are more pronounced than the cognitive decline associated with normal aging.

 The prevalence of MCI ranges from 3% to 19% in adults older than 65 years; some of these individuals seem to remain stable or return to normal over time, but more than half progress to dementia within 5 year.

 Thus, MCI represents a critical window of opportunity for intervening and altering the trajectory of both cognitive decline and loss of functional independence in older adults.

 Impaired working memory (WM) is regarded as one of the core symptoms of patients with MCI.

 Recent studies have suggested that WM can be improved trough computer based WM training in early patients with alzheimer's disease and normal ageing population.

 However, there are still insufficient evidence regarding its effect on MCI.

 Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate if working memory training is effective in improving memory MCI patients.

 Further, to evaluate if cognitive training relates to the function and structure of the brain.

 Patients and Methods: The proposed study is a blinded, randomized and controlled trial that will include 120 elderly patients with MCI from the memory clinic.

 The groups will be randomized to either intervention or waiting-list group.

 The intervention is computerized working memory training performed for 60 minutes x 4 times/week over 24 weeks.

 Neuropsychological assessment will be administered at baseline and week 4, 12 and 24 after intervention.

 The structural and functional MRI, EEG and NIRS will be performed at baseline and week 24 after intervention for a sub-study on the effect of cognitive training on brain structure and function.
