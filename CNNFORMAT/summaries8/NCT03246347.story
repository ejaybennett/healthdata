(thirdQuint)A Trial of Androgen Deprivation, Docetaxel, and Enzalutamide for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.

 This is a single center, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the 12 month PSA complete response rate in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer treated with ADT, docetaxel and enzalutamide.

 The primary endpoint of this study will be 12-month PSA complete response rate, which will be assessed against a contemporary historical control rate for the combination of ADT and docetaxel alone in the metastatic hormone naA-ve setting.

 The study will be conducted at all participating sites across North and South Carolina within the Levine Cancer Institute network.

 Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 24 months.
