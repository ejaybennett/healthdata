(thirdQuint)Compare Outcomes of CPR Between the Video-laryngoscopy (VL) Users and the Direct-laryngoscopy (DL) Users.

 Endotracheal intubation (ETI) has been considered to be the best method of airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 However ETI during CPR is a highly skill-dependent procedure, then it should be attempted only highly trained physicians.

 Because of technical difficulty in using direct laryngoscopy (DL), various types of videolaryngoscopy (VL) devices using micro-camera technology have been designed to overcome the problems of DL.

 This study tried to compare the recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival discharge between use of standard device (DL) and VL in a real clinical setting.

 In addition, this study also compare the first pass success rate of ETI,speed of ETI, incidences of complications, and chest compression interruptions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation between both device users.

 Compare Outcomes of CPR Between the Video-laryngoscopy (VL) Users and the Direct-laryngoscopy (DL) Users@highlight

This is a clinical study based on the analysis of video-clip data of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical data for out of hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2011 and 2015.

 Aim of study is to compare the endotracheal intubation performance and CPR outcomes between videolaryngoscopy (VL) and direct laryngoscopy (DL) users.
