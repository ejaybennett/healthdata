(secondQuint)Pulmonary Rehabilitation in End-Stage Liver Disease.

 Participants will be randomized into two groups.

 The Pulmonary Rehabilitation group will undergo exercise under a supervised setting for a total duration of 12 weeks.

 Patients will perform endurance (treadmill or cycle ergometer), strength (weight resistance) and flexibility training twice a week for a period of an hour per session.

 Exercises will be supervised by physiotherapists or exercise physiologists.

 Compliance and performance will be monitored by the trainer.

 They will receive a pedometer for home use.

 The Home based program group will perform REST for 10 minutes daily, increasing to 20 minutes daily, after the second week, in their home environment.

 The total duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks.

 Patients will be provided with pedometers, REST video and binder, with instructions on how to perform exercises, and resistance bands.
