(thirdQuint)Randomized Study of Elective Regional Lymph Node Irradiation in N1 Breast Cancer.

 Objective: - Compare the effect of post-BCS WBI vs.

 WB+RNI on disease-free survival in pN1 breast cancer patients who received AT-based chemotherapy.

 - Evaluate the impact of WBI or WB+RNI according to molecular subtype of tumor.

 - Compare the treatment-related toxicities between the WBI and WB+RNI.

 - Compare the patient's quality of life between the WBI and WB+RNI.

 Outline: This is a a randomized, multi-center, phase III study.

 Patients are stratified according to molecular subtype of tumor (luminal A vs luminal vs luminal HER2 vs HER2-enriched vs basal-like), axillary lymph node management (sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLN] only vs axillary lymph node dissection+/- SLN) and participating institutions.

 Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive WB+RNI.

 - Arm II: Patients receive WBI alone.

 Arm circumference and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 & EORTC QLQ-BR23) are assessed within 2 weeks prior to randomization, during the last week of radiotherapy, at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, and then annually thereafter for five years.

 Patients are followed at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy and annually thereafter for seven years.

 Randomized Study of Elective Regional Lymph Node Irradiation in N1 Breast Cancer@highlight

This study evaluates the impact of elective regional lymph node irradiation on N1 breast cancer patients receiving post-lumpectomy radiotherapy and anthracycline plus taxane (AT)-based chemotherapy.

 We randomly assign patients having one to three metastatic lymph nodes (pN1) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and AT-based chemotherapy to undergo either whole-breast and regional nodal irradiation (WB+RNI group) or whole-breast irradiation alone (WBI group).
