(secondQuint)Comparing Treatments for HIV-Infected Opioid Users in an Integrated Care Effectiveness Study (CHOICES) Scale-Up.

 The CTN-0055 CHOICES pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for treatment of opioid use disorder in HIV primary care.

 The CTN-0067 CHOICES scale-up study builds on lessons learned from the pilot and uses the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to advance understanding of XR-NTX adoption in HIV primary care clinics.

 The study is an open-label, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of office-based XR-NTX for 24 weeks (6 monthly injections) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in HIV-infected participants with untreated opioid use disorder.

 Each participant will be engaged in the overall study for 25 to 28 weeks, depending on the speed of screening and enrollment procedures.
