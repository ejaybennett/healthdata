(fifthQuint)The Prevalence and Incidence of DVT in General ICU.

 Type of the study: Observational prospective cohort study.

 Hypothesis: Despite appropriate prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis in general ICU patients in accordance with the current guidelines, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis is 5 - 10%.

 Sample size: 200 consecutive general ICU patients.

 Inclusion and exclusion criteria: defined in the Eligibility section.

 Protocol description: All patients admitted to ICU with expected period of the stay longer than 72 hours will be evaluated for the presence of deep venous thrombosis by ultrasound testing during the first 48 hours of ICU stay.

 Thereafter, each participant will be examined by ultrasound testing twice a week until the discharge from ICU.

 All patients will receive deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis following the current guidelines.

 All patients with positive finding of deep venous thrombosis will be managed in accordance with the current guidelines.

 Ultrasound examination for deep venous thrombosis: Ultrasound compression test at the following locations: common femoral vein at the groin, deep femoral vein, popliteal vein, both extremities.

 The Prevalence and Incidence of DVT in General ICU@highlight

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) represents a major problem in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

 Despite the use of recommended pharmacological prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), the incidence of DVT during ICU stay has been reported between 5 and 15 %.

 The incidence may vary due to many factors, for example the type of ICU population, the type of protocol of pharmacological prophylaxis and also the type of diagnostic approach.

 Before formerly planned clinical study targeted to lower DVT incidence by individualizing the dose of LMWH, the investigators decided to evaluate the real DVT incidence in the investigated ICU.

 The prevalence and incidence will be assessed by ultrasound testing in general ICU patients.

 on the sample of 200 patients.

 The investigators hypothesize DVT incidence of 5 %.

 The compliance to the local DVT prophylaxis protocol will be also evaluated.
