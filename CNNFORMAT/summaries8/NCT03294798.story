(secondQuint)Study of Recombinant Human Serum Albumin/Interferon alpha2b Fusion Protein in Hepatitis B Patient.

 This is an open-label study that will be conducted at three sites in China to characterize the PK/PD profile, safety and tolerability of Recombinant Human Serum Albumin/interferon alpha2b Fusion Protein in HBV subjects.

 Subjects will receive a single dose of Recombinant Human Serum Albumin/interferon alpha2b Fusion Protein or active comparator Pegasys at Day 0.

 A multipule-dose administration in HBV subjects will last 12 weeks after four weeks washout period.
