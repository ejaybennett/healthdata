(fifthQuint)Taping in Children With Cerebral Palsy.

 We evaluated a non-probability convenience sample.

 Participants were recruited in the rehabilitation clinic of the university and care facilities, between July of 2013 and July of 2014.

 Body structures and functions and functionality component of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Healthy, were evaluated.

 Muscle activity (electromyography) and trunk and lower limbs alignment (kinematics) were evaluated as body structures and functions measures.

 Time used to perform STS was used as functionality measure.

 We evaluated sit to stand in three conditions: a) without taping; b) with KT, which was characterized as the use of KT with tension; c) placebo.

 Baseline measurement: STS without taping.

 The child was seated in a seat with adjustable height, without shoes.

 Both feet were symmetrically positioned shoulder width apart and arms were crossed over the chest.

 The participants could not use their arms to push up off the chair.

 Also, the child should be seated with gluteal and the upper thighs regions supported in seat.

 Children performed STS in a speed that simulated the one usually adopted in daily routine.

 Baseline measurement was evaluated in three seat heights: neutral, elevated and lowered.

 Neutral corresponded to a seated position with 90 of hip, knee and ankle flexion.

 Lowered and elevated were defined as, respectively, 80 and 120% of neutral height.

The order of seat heights was randomized by drawing lots.

 A interval of 5 minutes was allowed between each seat height.

 Evaluations were carried out in two testing episodes, with one-week interval between them.

 On the first day, additional to baseline, the child performed STS with KT or placebo.

 The determination of which tape condition would be applied was randomized by drawing lots.

 A 15-minute interval between baseline and tape condition was established.

 On the second day, the tape condition that was not performed on the first day was evaluated.

 In all conditions, the child performed STS in three seat heights.

 Taping in Children With Cerebral Palsy@highlight

Kinesio taping (KT) has been commonly used in rehabilitation in children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP).

 However, there is a lack of studies that verified the effects of KT in CP.

 We aimed to verify the effects of KT in the performance of sit to stand movement (STS) in children with spastic UCP (USCP).

 A blinded, placebo and repeated-measure design was applied.

 The setting was the rehabilitation clinic of the university and care facilities.

 Eleven children, aged from 6 to 12 years old (10.

5-2.

8 years), diagnosed with USCP, Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II were evaluated.

 KT was applied over rectus femoris (RF) muscle of the affected limb.

 We considered three taping conditions: KT, without KT (with tension) and placebo (KT without tension).

 Mean root mean square (mRMS) of RF; initial, final and peak angles, and range of motion of trunk, pelvis, hip, knee and ankles joints; and total duration of STS were considered.

 STS was evaluated from three seat heights, neutral (100%), lowered (80%) and elevated (120%).

 Mixed ANOVA test was applied for angular variables of hip, knee and ankle, and mRMS of RF.

 Repeated ANOVA was applied for angular variables of trunk and pelvis, total duration.
