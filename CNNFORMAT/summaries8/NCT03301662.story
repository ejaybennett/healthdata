(fifthQuint)Transient Electrocardiogram Assessment in Stroke Evaluation.

 Stroke survivors in Region Gavleborg, Sweden, will be eligible for the study from October 2017.

 Patients with a history of ischemic stroke without documented atrial fibrillation before or during ECG evaluation in the stroke unit will be evaluated by the chest and thumb-ECG system Coala Heart Monitor.

 The monitoring system is connected to a smart phone application which allows for remote monitoring and prompt advice on clinical management.

 Over a period of 28 days, patients will be monitored twice daily and may activate the ECG recording at symptoms.

 Upon completion, the system is returned by mail.

 This system offers a possibility to evaluate the presence of atrial fibrillation post-stroke, but the feasibility of this system in patients who recently suffered from a stroke is unknown.

 In addition Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 in comparison to Swedish population norms will be assessed.

 The feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor will be assessed by a self-developed questionnaire.

 Transient Electrocardiogram Assessment in Stroke Evaluation@highlight

In stroke survivors, atrial fibrillation is typically detected with short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in the stroke unit.

 Prolonged continuous ECG monitoring is impractical and requires substantial resources while insertable cardiac monitors are invasive and costly.

 Chest and thumb-ECG could provide an alternative for atrial fibrillation detection post-stroke.

 The primary objective of our study is to assess the incidence of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation during 28 days of chest and thumb-ECG monitoring in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

 Secondary objectives are to assess Health-related Quality of Life using Short Form-36 and the feasibility of the Coala Heart Monitor in patients with stroke.
