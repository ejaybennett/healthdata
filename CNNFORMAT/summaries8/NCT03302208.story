(thirdQuint)Preoperative Oral Pregabalin Effect on Inhalational Anesthetic Requirements ln Hysterectomy Under General Anesthesia.

 In this study the investigators hypothesized that preoperative pregabalin tablet (150 mg orally ) would be effective in reducing intraoperative isoflurane requirement needed to maintain intraoperative hemodynamics within 20% of baseline measurement and/or attenuates hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in female patients ASA I or II schedule for elective abdominal hysterectomy surgery under general anaesthesia.

 The investigators aim to compare the efficacy of preoperative oral pregabalin versus placebo in reducing intraoperative isoflurane requirements needed to maintain intraoperative hemodynamic stability (Blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline measurements) in female patients ASA I/II undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy surgery under general anaesthesia.
