(fifthQuint)Educational Intervention to Increase the Emotional Competence of Patients With Oesogastric and Bronchopulmonary Cancers.

 After the end of treatments, cancer patients face a difficult time because it is expected that they return to normal, but at the same time they still have to struggle with the aftermath of cancer and fear of recurrence.

 This is why there is room in this period for an intervention designed to help patients to cope with their emotions.

 Patient emotional skills are patient abilities to identify, express and manage their emotions for the best possible psychological adjustment.

 In general population, emotional skills have been shown to be highly related to a better quality of life.

 In this randomized controlled study, bronchopulmonary and oesogastric cancer patients between 6 months and 2 years after the end of treatments will undergo either the emotional skills intervention (intervention group) or the relaxation group (control group).
