(fifthQuint)Evaluating the Effects of Frozen Section Technology on Oncological and Functional Outcomes at Radical Prostatectomy.

.

 Localised prostate cancer is usually curable with surgery.

 Surgery often entails side effects of permanent impotence and temporary urinary incontinence.

 These side effects can be minimised by protecting the nerves that run in the outer layer of the prostate (nerve sparing), however this increases the risk of exposure of the underlying tumour (a positive surgical margin-PSM) and a need for extra treatment in the form of radiotherapy.

 PSMs are more likely to occur if the tumour is starting to grow out of the prostate (stage pT3a) and in areas where pT3a disease is suspected nerve sparing cannot safely be performed.

 At University College Hospital London (UCLH) the chance of a man being potent after radical prostatectomy is dependent on the amount of nervous tissue left behind.

 80% of men in whom the nervous tissue is spared on both sides of the prostate would be expected to be able to get erections adequate for penetrative sexual intercourse using phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5i's, viagra or similar).

 UK surgeons base a decision of whether to nerve spare or not on the degree of suspicion that pathological stage (pT) 3a disease is present, estimated from the patients prostate biopsies and MRI scan as well as a thorough clinical examination.

 Unfortunately, our ability to detect pT3a disease is limited.

 even with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is regarded as the best way to distinguish pT2 from pT3a disease resulting in uncertainty as to when nerve sparing is oncologically safe.

 In order to decrease this uncertainty a group from Germany have developed the NeuroSAFE technique, where after nerve sparing, a frozen section analysis of the area adjacent to the nerve spare, is performed, whilst the surgeon completes the rest of the operation, and if a PSM is detected the nerve tissue is then excised.

 NeuroSAFE has been shown in cohort studies to decrease PSM rate whilst promoting nerve sparing and potency.

 No level one data exist regarding the effectiveness of this technique.

 The German centre where the technique was developed now performs the technique on all cases meaning the opportunity to evaluate the technique in the setting of an RCT has been missed.

 The technique is only performed routinely in one NHS centre, Lister Hospital.

 The current situation provides a unique opportunity to fully evaluate the benefits of this technique for NHS patients.

 The proposed study, NeuroSAFE PROOF, is a multicentre RCT designed to compare short term oncological and functional outcomes after robotic radical prostatectomy with nerve sparing performed according to current UK practice (based on a perceived risk of pT3a disease from prostate biopsy, MRI and examination findings) with patients who have undergone the NeuroSAFE procedure.

 For the feasibility phase 50 patients will be randomised 1:1.

 A NeuroSAFE training academy will be established.

 The proposed study is to evaluate the potential benefit of a novel surgical technique for NHS patients before the procedure is taken up as it has been elsewhere and the opportunity to randomise/evaluate is lost.

Prostate cancer is common but can commonly be cured with surgery, however, this often leads to a loss of erections, because the nerves controlling erections run in the outer coverings of the prostate.

 Nerve sparing, where the outer layers of the prostate are peeled off, increases post-operative potency, but also increases the risk of cancer being left behind and the need for radiotherapy, which renders the men impotent, even if they had nerve sparing surgery.

 A new technique called NeuroSAFE incorporates an additional safety check designed to promote nerve sparing without compromising cancer control.

 During surgery, a pathologist examines the prostate near the nerves to check for exposed cancer.

 If cancer is found, the nerve tissue is removed so the recurrence risk is similar to when cancer cells are not exposed.

 The investigators eventual aim is to perform a large scale RCT comparing NeuroSAFE with current UK practice (nerve sparing based on MRI scan, biopsy results and clinical examination).

 This application is to fund a feasibility study to ensure that men are prepared to be randomised within an RCT, and that the technique can be taught to other UK centres, so allowing participation in the multi-centre RCT.

 The investigators will gather data to allow us to plan the larger study by defining the primary outcome measure and powering the study based on the size and confidence interval of observed effects.

 This study is needed because with evidence supporting observation of low risk small cancers, a higher proportion of men undergoing surgery have capsular involvement.

 The investigators do not have a reliable way to detect cancer which has spread through the capsule of the prostate in whom nerve sparing would cause a positive surgical margin.

 The NeuroSAFE technique addresses this need and will only be available at participating centres through this trial.
