(fifthQuint)Preference-Based Exercise RCT for Men With PC on ADT.

 BACKGROUND: The backbone of scientific evidence to address most scientific questions, including behavioural interventions, is randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

 Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, affecting 1 in 7 men.

 Almost 50% of these men will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at some point after diagnosis to reduce disease progression and prolong survival.

 ADT is associated with multiple adverse effects, including diminished quality of life (QOL), fatigue, reduced muscle mass, and metabolic effects.

 Numerous RCTs in the setting of men on ADT have demonstrated that exercise programs, particularly supervised 1:1 in-centre programs, are clinically effective.

 However, they are resource-intensive and have low scalability.

 Alternative delivery models such as group-based supervised exercise or home-based exercise are promising alternatives but require rigorous efficacy data.

 While conducting a two-centre exercise trial comparing different exercise delivery models, fewer than 40% of eligible men agreed to participate.

 Two common reasons why men declined participation were distance to exercise centres and unwillingness to be randomized.

 Novel clinical trial designs, such as preference-based trials, may help answer effectiveness questions and enhance generalizability by recruiting a more representative pool of men.

 Increased efficiencies in recruitment, however, may come at a cost of bias with non-randomized designs as well as differential effects of exercise and varying adherence.

 In parallel with a multi-centre phase III RCT funded by CIHR, we propose to conduct a pilot preference-based trial, examining 3 key issues.

 First, can we successfully enroll men who are unwilling to be randomized due either to distance from centre or a strong preference for one exercise delivery model? Second, are these men different from men who are randomized in terms of baseline characteristics, study retention, and adherence to the intervention? Third, are the benefits of an exercise program similar to men who are randomized to the same arm? OBJECTIVES: To determine, in men on ADT who are otherwise eligible to participate in a RCT of different exercise delivery models but decline to be randomized due to distance from the study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model: 1.

 What proportion of these men are willing to be enrolled in a preference-based trial.

 2.

 How comparable are these men who agree to participate in the intervention arm of their choice to those randomized to the same arm in terms of baseline characteristics, study retention, and adherence to the intervention? 3.

 How comparable are the benefits in terms of quality of life and physical fitness outcomes among men in the preference-based arms to those in the same randomized intervention arm? METHODS: Patients aged 18 or older on ADT for high-risk/locally advanced, biochemically relapsed, or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible if they are otherwise eligible for an ongoing phase III RCT of exercise but decline to participate due to either distance from study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model.

 The main phase III RCT is examining a 6-month individualized, progressive, mixed-modality exercise program including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility components delivered using one of two delivery models: supervised in-centre group exercise 3 times weekly or home-based exercise supported by a Fitbit, smart phone app, and remote health coach.

 To meet the objectives of this pilot preference trial, we will enroll 50 men per preference arm at three experienced study sites (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Scarborough and Rouge Hospital, Scarborough and the University of Calgary, Calgary and).

 We will examine the proportion of otherwise eligible men who decline participation in the RCT but agree to participate in a preference trial as well as reasons for declining.

 We will compare the baseline sociodemographic, fitness, and clinical characteristics of these men with corresponding men from the randomized trial.

 We will examine study retention and adherence (measured via sessional attendance, health coach contact, and accelerometry).

 We will also calculate preliminary within-group effect estimates for our co-primary outcomes (fatigue (FACT-Fatigue) and aerobic fitness (6-minute walk test) as well as various secondary outcomes.

 SIGNIFICANCE: Behavioural interventions require significant patient commitment and although most RCTs to date have shown evidence of benefit on various outcomes, recruitment rates have been low and many otherwise eligible men are not willing to be randomized for different reasons.

 Designing trials that allow inclusion of such men is obviously going to improve generalizability but whether the results of interventions are similarly effective and understanding the feasibility and potential biases of enrolling such men are fundamental unresolved issues.

 This pilot study will take advantage of an existing trial to begin to answer these questions and determine whether a larger preference-based trial is worth undertaking.

 Our findings have potential widespread implications for behavioural trials across many health care settings.

 Preference-Based Exercise RCT for Men With PC on ADT@highlight

Prostate cancer affects 1 in 7 men.

 Half of these men are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

 ADT slows disease progression and prolongs survival, but it also leads to worse quality of life (QOL), fatigue, loss of strength and fitness, osteoporosis, and diabetes.

 The investigators' recent research has shown that individually supervised exercise, supervised group exercise and home-based exercise are equally good at improving these side effects.

 Now the investigators are doing a larger trial with multiple centres to see whether supervised group or home-based exercise is clinically better and more economical.

 A major challenge in such trials is that a significant number of men refuse to be randomized because (a) the participant lives too far from a study centre and cannot come for supervised exercise; or (b) the participant has a strong preference as to which type of exercise program the participant wants to do.

 Experts have raised concerns that classic randomized trials are too restrictive, selective, and less practical; the study results are less applicable to the real world.

 Despite its obvious importance, it is not known whether men who refuse to be randomized to an exercise trial but are otherwise willing to participate would benefit similarly to men who are randomized.

 In this study, we will recruit men who are otherwise eligible for our randomized trial but refuse it for one of the reasons above.

 We will allow these men to choose either supervised group or home-based exercise, and then compare them to the men who are being randomized to the two treatments in 3 important ways.

 First, are participants similar in terms of personal characteristics, QOL, and fitness levels? Second, do participants respond similarly to exercise in terms of QOL and physical fitness benefits? Third, do participants actually exercise as much as the randomized men? This work will help the research team understand whether there is a need to change the way exercise trials are done in order to be more relevant and wide-reaching for Canadians with a variety of health conditions.
