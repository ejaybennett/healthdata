(firstQuint)Effectiveness of Kinesio Taping On Balance In Patients With Stroke.

 Stroke is defined as a neurological deficit which lasts more than 24 hours caused by focal or global cerebral vascular injury such as embolism and hemorrhage (1).

 Majority of the stroke patients are elderly people and 80 % of them are over 65 years (2).

 Number of stroke incident are likely to be increased in the future because of the aging population (3, 4).

 Although stroke patients' mortality rates are significantly reduced by medical developments many of them become disabled.

 Only a small number of the stroke survivors can be independent in their daily life activities at the first week of the event and in the long term 25-75 % of them require human assistance (5, 6).

 Balance problems and falls are common in stroke patients.

 Postural swaying can be observed two-folds more in stroke patients compared to the healthy population.

 Weight-bearing asymmetry is an important expecting problem in patients with stroke due to the fact that 60-80% of body weight bears on unaffected side.

 Furthermore, it can cause a decrease in stability limits which are defined as the greatest distance in every direction a person can reach out from a midline vertical position without losing balance, stepping, or requiring a support (7).

 Maintaining standing balance on two feet can be done effortlessly by healthy individuals.

 However, difficulties are observed in stroke patients.

 Maintaining standing balance in stroke patients is characterized by both weight-bearing asymmetries developed by transposing more weight to the unaffected side and also increased spontaneous postural sways in the frontal plane.

 Muscle weakness, asymmetrical muscle tone, sensory deficit and decrease in body proprioception result in a reduced postural stability (8-10).

 It is considered that Kinesio tape (KT) stimulates and activates ankle stiffness, postural control mechanisms and improves postural stability.

 Recently, in addition to all other treatment methods KT stands out especially with the purpose of increasing awareness and sensory inputs (11).

 It was reported that KT activates and inhibits muscle activity and improves joint stability (12, 13).

 Therefore, it is found that KT can be effective in improving proprioception for increasing balance and postural stability (14, 15).

 Although there are many studies conducted on healthy individuals investigating the role of calf muscles in ankle stabilization, there are only a limited number of studies conducted on patients who have sensory deficit (16-19).

 In addition, there are few studies investigating the immediate effects of taping in stroke patients yet within our knowledge there is not any study that investigating the long term effects of KT (20).

 There is a constant requirement for specific data about stroke rehabilitation methods for achieving evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines.

 Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the long term effect of KT applied on ankle and peroneal muscle on both dynamic and static balance in patients with stroke.
