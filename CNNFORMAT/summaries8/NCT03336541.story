(fifthQuint)Low-dose Ketamine and Postpartum Depression in Parturients With Prenatal Depression.

 Postpartum depression refers to maternal depression developed early after childbirth, with reported incidences varied from 15% to 20%.

 The development of postpartum depression produces harmful effects not only on mothers, but also on infants and young children.

 Prenatal depression or high depression score is an independent risk factor for the development of postpartum depression.

 Ketamine is commonly used as an general anesthetic.

 In addition, low-dose ketamine is recommended for antidepressant therapy.

 We hypothesize that low-dose ketamine has a therapeutic effect on parturients with prenatal depression.

 However, evidences in this aspect are insufficient.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose ketamine administered during cesarean delivery can decrease the incidence of postpartum depression in parturients with prenatal depression.
