(fifthQuint)Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin Calcium, and Rucaparib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic, Colorectal, Gastroesophageal, or Biliary Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To establish the recommended dose level for the phase Ib and phase II trial of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) and fluorouracil (5-FU) with rucaparib (MFR) in patients with metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer (up to 2 lines of prior therapy), colorectal cancer (up to 3 lines of prior therapy), gastroesophageal cancer (up to 1 line of prior therapy) and biliary tract cancer (with 1 line of prior therapy allowed).

 (Phase I) II.

 To assess, in a preliminary fashion, antitumor efficacy, in terms of objective response, of the recommended dose level of combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU with rucaparib in patients with metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer (up to 1 line of prior therapy in the metastatic setting) and gastroesophageal cancer (with 1 line of prior therapy in the metastatic setting).

 (Phase Ib) III.

 To estimate the proportion of evaluable patients who reach complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) =< 32 weeks after registration among patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutation, treated with the combination of nal-IRI and 5FU/leucovorin calcium (LV) with rucaparib (MFR).

 (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutation, treated with the combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU/LV with rucaparib (MFR).

 (Phase II) II.

 To assess the toxicity of the combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU/LV with rucaparib in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1/2 and PALB2 mutation.

 (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To evaluate the role of genomic markers (signature) of HRD, mutation other than BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 as predictive biomarkers of response to MFR.

 II.

 To evaluate BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutations as predictive biomarker of response to MFR.

 OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of liposomal irinotecan and rucaparib and followed by a phase II study.

 Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15.

 Patients also receive rucaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 4-13 and 18-27.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

 Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin Calcium, and Rucaparib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic, Colorectal, Gastroesophageal, or Biliary Cancer@highlight

This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of liposomal irinotecan and rucaparib and when given together with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium and to see how well they work in treating patients with pancreatic, colorectal, gastroesophageal, or biliary cancer that has spread to other places in the body.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and rucaparib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
