(firstQuint)Evaluation of Long-term Coronary Stenting Outcomes in Diabetic Patients With or Without Optimal Glycemic Control.

 Despite recent advances in coronary revascularization, cardiovascular disease accounts for about 75% of all hospital admissions in diabetic patients.

although the introduction of drug-eluting stents has reduced the rates of restenosis after PCI, diabetic patients undergoing PCI will have poorer clinical outcomes.

In this study, we sought to investigate whether a pre and post procedural glycemic control in diabetic patients,as reflected by HgbA1C prior,1 and 6 months after elective PCI,was related to major advance cardiac events (MACE) during 3 year follow up.

the purpose of this study is to determine whether appropriate control of diabetes around the PCI time is related with MACE and outcome of diabetic patients.
