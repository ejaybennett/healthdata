(fifthQuint)A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate 6-Month Formulation.

 The primary hypothesis of this study is that the efficacy of PP6M is non-inferior to PP3M for preventing relapse in participants with schizophrenia who were previously stabilized on corresponding doses of PP1M or PP3M.

 The study consists of mainly 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 28 days), a maintenance phase (of 1 or 3 months), and a double-blind phase (of at least 12 months [neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving]).

 Additional/conditional phases include a transition phase (before maintenance phase) and an additional double-blind treatment phase (after the first 12 months of the double-blind phase).

 Study evaluations include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety.

 The study duration will vary from approximately 13 months to 31 months.

 A Study of Paliperidone Palmitate 6-Month Formulation@highlight

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that injection cycles consisting of a single administration of paliperidone palmitate 6-month (PP6M) (700 or 1000 milligrams equivalent [mg eq.

]) are not less effective than 2 sequentially administered injections of paliperidone palmitate 3-month PP3M) (350 or 525 mg eq.

) for the prevention of relapse in participants with schizophrenia previously stabilized on corresponding doses of paliperidone palmitate 1-month (PP1M) (100 or 150 mg eq.

) or PP3M (350 or 525 mg eq.

).
