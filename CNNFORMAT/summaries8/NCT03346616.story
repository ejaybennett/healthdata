(thirdQuint)Text4Peds: Short Message Service Evaluating Medical Student Education.

 In the last decade, the use of smartphone and text messaging (SMS) has increased significantly; during this time, text messaging has become the primary means of communication in some instances.

 Despite the popularity, text messaging and smartphones have been rarely utilized in the context of medical education.

 Few studies have been performed examining the effect of text messaging as an adjunct to traditional medical education.

 A previous study with the Saint Louis University (SLU) Pediatric Residency program, showed the feasibility of using text messaging to deliver medical information to pediatric residents through the Text4Peds program.

 This study aims to expand Text4Peds to third NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation performance.

 The NBME Pediatric Subject Evaluation is a national, standardized pediatric knowledge based exam from the NBME taken by all medical students at the end of their pediatric clerkship.

In this study, third year medical students on the pediatric clerkship will be randomized to receive either only written educational material (review journal articles) or written educational material plus daily text messages consisting of board style questions with online answers.

 The students' performance on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Pediatric Subject Evaluation will be compared between the two groups.
