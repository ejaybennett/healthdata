(thirdQuint)Genetic Screening and Assisted Oocyte Activation in Couples With Diminished/Aberrant Embryonic Development.

.

 Assisted Oocyte Activation (ICSI-AOA) will be the treatment for these patients to overcome their previous embryo developmental problems.

 This protocol artificially induces calcium rises in the oocyte, which mimics the natural oocyte activation process induced by the sperm factor PLCzeta.

 If 6 or more mature oocytes are collected at oocyte retrieval, 50%ICSI and 50% ICSI-AOA will be applied.

 If less than 6 mature oocytes are collected, ICSI-AOA will be applied to all oocytes.

 Regardless of the treatment group (ICSI or ICSI-AOA), the best embryo(s) will be transferred back.

 Rest embryo(s) will be vitrified for future cycles.

 Patients will be followed up.

 Furthermore, an additional sperm sample will be produced to investigate the calcium inducing pattern of the patients' spermatozoa.

 Thereby, mouse and/or human (research-donated control oocytes) will be pre-incubated with a Ca2+ sensitive dye.

 Next, human spermatozoa will be injected into these mouse/human oocytes and the calcium pattern will be recorded under an inverted epifluorescence microscope.

 Both partners will give a saliva sample to screen for mutations in the PLCzeta gene (male), the DUX4 gene (male and female) and possible other genes which are involved in and necessary in the early steps of oocyte activation and embryo development (such as DUX4 gene, PADI6 gene,.

@highlight

This is an interventional comparative study at the Department of Reproductive Medicine at Ghent University Hospital.

 Patients with previous embryo developmental problems are eligible for the study.

 Patients will undergo an ICSI-AOA treatment and will also be screened for genes important in the oocyte activation and embryonic development process.

 Also, the calcium releasing pattern of the patients' spermatozoa will be investigated.
