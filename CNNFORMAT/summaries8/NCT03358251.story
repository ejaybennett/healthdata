(fifthQuint)Investigation of the Safety and Efficacy of Pocket-X Gel and Pocket-X Chip.

 This study is a prospective open-label study that investigates the safety and efficacy of Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ gelling product and Pocket-X Chip, a periodontal film, in improving the healing of the gingiva and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing.

 The study includes 2 different arms.

 Both groups will undergo 1-4 sessions of scaling and root planing, which is the conventional treatment for periodontal disease.

 One group will undergo treatment with Pocket-X Gel, which will be inserted into periodontal pockets present in one/two of the participants mouth segments, following scaling and root planing.

 The other mouth segments will not undergo further intervention.

 Another group will undergo treatment with Pocket-X Chip, which will be inserted into periodontal pockets present in one/two of the participants mouth segments.

 The other mouth segments will not undergo further intervention.

 The rationale for the study is the hypothesis that a physical barrier inserted into periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing would assist in maintaining the pocket clean by preventing bacteria from re-entering the cleaned pocket, thus allowing the gums to properly heal and seal the pockets while preventing further inflammation.

 Investigation of the Safety and Efficacy of Pocket-X Gel and Pocket-X Chip@highlight

This study is a prospective open-label controlled study in which the Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ gelling product, or Pocket-X Chip, a periodontal film, will be applied to periodontal pockets in one/two mouth segment(s) of participants following scaling and root planing on the entire mouth, while the contra-lateral segment(s) will serve as control.

 The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of Pocket-X Gel and Pocket-X Chip in improving the healing of the gingiva and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing.
