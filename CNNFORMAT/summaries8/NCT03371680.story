(secondQuint)Kinetics of Surfactant Proteins, Phosphatidylcholine and Body Water in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

 Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have low concentrations of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and altered fluid metabolism.

 Injection of stable isotopes such as 13 Carbon Leucine and deuterated water allows the analysis of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C kinetics, total body water and water turnover in patients with ARDS and in human adults with normal lungs (controls).

 Kinetics of Surfactant Proteins, Phosphatidylcholine and Body Water in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)@highlight

Analysis of kinetics of phosphatidylcholine and specific surfactant proteins, total body water and water turnover in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in intensive care unit (ICU) patients by using non radioactive isotopes as deuterium and Carbon-13.
