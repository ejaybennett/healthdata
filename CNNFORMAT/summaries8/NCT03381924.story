(fifthQuint)Educational Intervention in Patients With Migraine.

 The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a group educational intervention about concepts of pain neuroscience, in the management of migraine, compared to routine medical interventions, in primary care health centres of Alava.

 After recruitment, patients were interviewed by the research team members in charge of the assessments.

 In these interviews, data were collected on the following: demographic characteristics, beliefs regarding migraine, coping strategies for migraine attacks, the MIDAS questionnaire (16), medication taken, work leave, emergency department attendances and limitation of daily activities due to migraine, during the previous 3 months.

 Subsequently, we carried out further assessments over the telephone after 3, 6 and 12 months.

 Very few studies assessing preventive treatments for migraine have performed assessments 12 months after initiating prophylactic treatment, most having followed-up patients for 6 months at most.

 We believe, however, it is necessary to continue assessments for at least 1 year to properly test the efficacy of treatment for chronic illnesses like migraine.

 The individuals carrying out the assessment were blinded to group allocation.

 The clinical follow-up was the same for both groups, the only difference in their management being the educational intervention itself.

 Educational Intervention in Patients With Migraine@highlight

Introduction: Despite the numerous pharmacological treatment options available for migraine attacks and for the prevention of thereof, less than 30% of patients with migraine are highly satisfied with their current treatment.

 In recent decades, there has been a radical change in the way we view pain, thanks to developments in neuroscience.

 It is currently considered that pain does not originate in the peripheral nociceptors, but rather in a network of brain regions (the pain neuromatrix), the synchronous activation of which is necessary and sufficient to generate the perception of pain.

 Migraine may be the expression of this exaggerated perception of threat, a perception that, from a cultural learning perspective, it may be possible to modify by adjusting beliefs and behaviours that favour the onset of an attack.

 The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a group educational intervention about concepts of pain neuroscience, in the management of migraine, compared to routine medical interventions, in primary care health centres of Alava.
