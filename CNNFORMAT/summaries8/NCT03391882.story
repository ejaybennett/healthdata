(secondQuint)A Study of an Investigational Drug to See How it Affects the People With Parkinson's Disease Complicated by Motor Fluctuations ("OFF" Episodes) Compared to an Approved Drug Used to Treat People With Parkinson's Disease Complicated by Motor Fluctuations ("OFF" Episodes).

 An Open-Label, Randomized, Crossover Trial utilizing a Single-Blinded Rater to evaluate sublingual administered APL-130277 (apomorphine) compared to subcutaneously administered APO-go(R) (apomorphine) in Levodopa Responsive Subjects with Parkinson's Disease complicated by motor fluctuations.

 This is a two part study.

 The first part consists of an open-label, crossover titration phase where subjects will be randomly assigned to APL-130277 or APO-go(R) and titrated to the dose that turns them from the practically defined "OFF" state to the full "ON" state.

 They will then be crossed over to the other drug and similarly titrated to the dose that provides a full "ON" state.

 The second part of the study consists of open-label repeated doses of APL-130277 or APO-go(R) (at the dose determined in the first part) for 28 days, and then cross-over to the other drug for repeat doses for 28 days.
