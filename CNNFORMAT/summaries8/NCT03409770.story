(firstQuint)Optimising the Duration of Cooling in Mild Encephalopathy.

 Although cooling the body to 33.

5C for 72 hours benefits babies who have severe forms of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, most babies have milder forms of brain injury (i.

e.

 mild encephalopathy).

 Approximately 20% of the babies with mild encephalopathy have adverse long term neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly in the cognitive domain.

 Pre-clinical data suggest that therapeutic hypothermia is remarkably neuroprotective in milder brain insults and reduces white matter injury.

 Hence, a shorter duration of cooling may be sufficient to provide neuroprotection.

 COMET is a sequential study that includes a feasibility phase (current protocol), phase II randomised controlled trial to identify the 'optimal cooling duration', and then a final confirmatory phase III clinical trial to examine if cooling therapy at this optimal duration improves neurodevelopmental outcomes after mild encephalopathy.

 AIMS 1.

 To examine the feasibility of recruiting and randomising babies with mild neonatal encephalopathy to multiple treatment durations.

 2.

 To examine the feasibility of obtaining adequate quality data on the primary outcome for the phase II trial (i.

e.

 thalamic N-acetylaspartate concentration) in the recruited babies 3.

 To examine the feasibility of collecting adequate quality data for exploratory sub-studies on heart rate variability and gene expression profile METHODS A total of 32 babies with mild neonatal encephalopathy will be recruited from several large hospitals in the UK over a one year period.

 The eligible babies will be randomised to normothermia (36.

0C to 36.

5C) or whole-body cooling for one of three durations: 24h, 48h, or 72h followed by rewarming at 0.

5C per hour.

 We will collect 0.

5 ml of venous or arterial blood at the time of recruitment (aged <6 hours) and again at 80 hours of age for gene expression profiling.

 Continuous ECG data and aEEG data will be collected from all babies from the time of recruitment (aged <6h) for at least 80 hours.

 The thalamic concentration of N-acetyl-aspartate, [NAA], will be measured using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy performed between 4 and 7 days after birth.

 DATA ANALYSIS AND OUTCOME MEASURES - Proportion of the eligible babies recruited and the realistic recruitment rates per centre - Number of babies with adequate quality data on thalamic NAA levels.

 POPULATION AND DESIGN 32 newborn babies with mild encephalopathy randomised to 4 different intervention arms.

 BENEFITS These data will eventually inform national and international guidelines on management of babies with mild neonatal encephalopathy.

 If cooling reduces the brain injury, and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes, it will have a substantial health and economic impact in the UK and other high-income countries.
