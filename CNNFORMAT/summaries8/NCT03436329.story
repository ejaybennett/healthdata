(secondQuint)Reduced Dissemination of Tumor Cells With Primary Ligation of the Vein in Patients With Lung Cancer.

 Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood can be a biomarker to predict tumor recurrence and survival.

 Handling the tumor during a surgery may promote the release of CTCs into the bloodstream.

 Therefore, in a surgery of cancer, interruption of the vein before ligation of the artery may be justified.

 This multi-center randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of the sequence of vessel interruption in lung cancer patients on tumor cell spread and patient survival by using peripheral blood CTCs.
