(thirdQuint)Comparing Differing Financial Incentive Structures for Increasing Antidepressant Adherence Among Adults.

 A three arm randomized controlled trial will compare interventions to promote antidepressant adherence.

 One hundred twenty adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are initiating antidepressant treatment will be randomized in equal proportion to 1) usual care, 2) usual care and an escalating daily financial incentive for 6 weeks, or 3) usual care and a de-escalating financial incentive for daily antidepressant adherence for 6 weeks.

 Study patients will participate in three assessments over a 12 week period as well as passive monitoring of antidepressant daily adherence through a wireless electronic pill bottle over the same 12 week period.

 The primary outcome will be the number of antidepressant daily doses taken during the initial six weeks of treatment.

 The secondary outcome will be daily adherence during the next six weeks following the discontinuation of the intervention.
