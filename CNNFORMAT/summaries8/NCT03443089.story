(fifthQuint)Comparative Bioavailability of Two Injectable Suspension Formulations of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate+Estradiol Cypionate.

 This study was performed in a monocentric, open label, parallel design, with 2 treatments, 1 period, in which twelve subjects received the test product (Depomes(R), 25 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate + 5 mg/mL estradiol cypionate, Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica Ltda.

) and twelve subjects received the reference product (Cyclofemina(R), 25 mg/0.

5 mL medroxyprogesterone acetate + 5 mg/0.

5 mL estradiol cypionate, Millet Roux Ltda.

).

 The formulations (test or reference) were administered in a single intramuscular dose (1 ampoule) after an overnight fast (approximately 8 h).

 Blood samples (9 mL) were collected via a venous catheter into heparinized tubes at times pre-dose (0 h) and 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240, 288, 336, 432, 504, 672, 840, 1008, 1176, 1344, 1512, 1680, 1848, and 2016 h after drug administration to measure medroxyprogesterone; and pre-dose (-48, -24 and 0 h) e 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240, 288, 336, 432, 504, 672, 840, and 1008 h after drug administration to measure estradiol cypionate.

 The safety assessment was based on recording adverse events throughout the study duration.

 The subjects systolic and diastolic pressures, heart rate and temperature were determined prior and at approximately 4, 8 and 12 h after drug administration.

 The clinical evaluation and the laboratory tests were also performed at the end of the study.

 Comparative Bioavailability of Two Injectable Suspension Formulations of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate+Estradiol Cypionate@highlight

This clinical trial evaluated the comparative bioavailability of two injectable suspension formulations of medroxyprogesterone acetate + estradiol cypionate, a test (Depomes(R), 25 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate + 5 mg/mL estradiol cypionate, Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica Ltda.

) and a reference formulation (Cyclofemina(R), 25 mg/0.

5 mL medroxyprogesterone acetate + 5 mg/0.

5 mL estradiol cypionate, Millet Roux Ltda.

) in healthy female volunteers after a single intramuscular dose administration.

 In addition, this study also evaluated the safety and tolerability of these drugs.
