(secondQuint)Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of RXC004 in Advanced Malignancies.

 Part A of the study will consist of an ascending monotherapy dose, the doses are pre-defined.

 The decision to escalate will be made upon the assessment of safety and tolerability data in the first cycle of treatment.

 Part A - Module 1 will commence with an accelerated dose escalation schedule and enrol one (1) patient into a cohort with follow up for adverse events and dose limiting toxicities.

 Once a Minimal Biologically Active Dose (MBAD) has been found to be tolerated, dose escalations will continue in a 3+3 design to further characterise the PK profile, Maximum Tolerated Dose and Maximum Feasible Dose.

 Part B study design will be adapted based on the emerging data from Part A.

 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of RXC004 in Advanced Malignancies@highlight

The purpose of Part A of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of RXC004 in patients with advanced malignancies.

 In order to define the doses and schedules for further clinical evaluation.
