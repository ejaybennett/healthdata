(firstQuint)A Study of TAK-164 in Participants With Advanced Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancer Expressing Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC).

 The drug being tested in this study is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called TAK-164.

 TAK-164 is being evaluated in participants with advanced GCC-positive GI cancer (Part A) or CRC (Part B) to determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) and MTD/RP2D of TAK-164, as well as the preliminary efficacy.

 The study will include approximately 95 evaluable participants.

 In Part A (Escalation), approximately 45 participants with GI carcinoma will be enrolled in 2 arms planned dose escalation scheme.

 Those include patients with various GI malignancies such as carcinomas of esophagus, stomach, colon, and pancreas.

 The starting dose for Arm 1 will be 0.

004 mg/kg of TAK-164 administered IV on Day 1 every 3 Week (Q3W).

 Arm 2, will enroll approximately 20 participants after at least 4 dose levels of TAK-164 in Part A.

 TAK-164 will be administered IV on Days 1 and 15 every 2 Week (Q2W).

 In Part B (Expansion), approximately 50 participants will be enrolled to receive TAK-164 infusion at determined RP2D in Part A.

 Participants will follow either the Q2W schedule or the Q3W schedule and will be followed until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or until they choose to withdraw consent.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted to include United States, Spain, Netherlands and United Kingdom.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 55 months.

 Participants will attend an end of study (EOS) visit 30 days after the last dose of TAK-164 or just prior to the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of TAK-164 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule.
