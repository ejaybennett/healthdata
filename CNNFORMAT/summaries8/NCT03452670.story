(fifthQuint)Contemplative Well-being Apps for the Workplace.

 Over the last 25 years, research on contemplative practices, a family of practices including mindfulness meditation and yoga, has advanced in domains both clinical and basic, motivated by burgeoning evidence of their efficacy for remediating psychopathology and augmenting well-being and resilience.

 However, much of this research has examined the effects of scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the course of several weeks.

 Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most common and arguably most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered Contemplative Applications (apps) for Well-being (CWAs).

 The proposed study will examine the use and impact of an app delivered to populations facing extreme time demands.

The study will examine the use and impact of a meditation app delivered to adult workforce populations facing extreme time demands.

 Enrollees will be randomized to either app or a wait-list group, and will be assessed in terms of job and daily functioning, well-being, and biomarkers of immune function and stress physiology, and neural structure and function prior to randomization and again at multiple time points after participants commence app engagement.

 In order to assess efficacy, we will examine the longitudinal changes in all measures in both the mindfulness group, compared to wait-list control group.
