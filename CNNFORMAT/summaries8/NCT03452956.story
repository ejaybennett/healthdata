(thirdQuint)The Neural Basis for Frontotemporal Degeneration.

 Comparative and longitudinal studies reveal clinical differences between subgroups of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including Progressive Non-fluent Aphasia (PNFA), Semantic Dementia (SD), patients with a disorder of social comportment and personality (SOC), and non-aphasic patients with executive dysfunction (EXEC).

 MRI studies of cortical atrophy and fMRI studies show correlated neural defects in FTD subgroups.

 We will obtain converging evidence from multiple sources to test hypotheses about the neural basis for cognitive functions such as semantic memory, grammatical processing, and social functioning in these FTD subgroups, while we improve clinical care for these patients.

 Recent studies have linked progressive supra nuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA) to FTD.

 We will obtain comparable neuropsychological and biomarker data in order to compare these patient groups.

 The Neural Basis for Frontotemporal Degeneration@highlight

This is an observational study that aims to better understand the genetic causes of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).

 It is hoped the information gathered in this study will help lead to better diagnostics and future treatments.
