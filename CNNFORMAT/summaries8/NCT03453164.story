(thirdQuint)Checkpoint Inhibitor and Radiotherapy for Recurrent Gastric Cancer (CIRCUIT).

 In patients with unresectable recurrent gastric cancer who progressed (SD or PD) after standard treatment (primary and secondary chemotherapy) and have more than one lesion assessable in diagnostic imaging (one lesion must be >=2cm), localized short-term radiotherapy of 22.

5 Gy/5 fractions/5 days will be applied to a symptomatic lesion or the largest asymptomatic lesion suitable for irradiation (Day 1-5).

 Nivolumab will be administered starting from Day 15-22 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (body wait) every 2 weeks to a total of 6 courses (end of intervention).

 The patients will be observed up to Day 18014 and evaluated on Day 18014 (end of study).

This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), which is approved as tertiary therapy, and neoadjuvant short-term limited local radiotherapy in patients with unresectable recurrent gastric cancer who progressed (SD or PD) after standard treatment (primary and secondary chemotherapy) and have more than one lesion assessable in diagnostic imaging (one lesion must be >=2cm).
