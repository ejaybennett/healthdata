(thirdQuint)Ventilation Distribution During Spontaneous Breathing in Healthy Newborn Infants.

 NEO SensorBelts will be used to observe ventilation distribution in healthy newborn infants during quiet spontaneous breathing.

 Child's position will be changed 5 times every 10 minutes in a random order.

 Positions observed will be: left lateral, right lateral, supine, prone face to left, prone face to right and supine with the bed tilted 30 degrees.

 Total duration for the recording will be 1 hour.

 Ventilation Distribution During Spontaneous Breathing in Healthy Newborn Infants@highlight

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an evolving monitoring tool for respiratory support in neonatal and pediatric intensive care.

 In this observational study basic EIT parameters will be measured on 20 healthy newborn infants during spontaneous breathing and assess the effect of position changes in ventilation distribution.
