(fifthQuint)Dual Field PEMF Therapy in Lower Extremity Painful Diabetic Distal Symmetric Peripheral Neuropathy.

 Part A of this trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted on subjects with painful diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy.

 Part B of this trial is a 2-month single-arm, open-label, active treatment extension period upon completion of Part A.

 Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with documented Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain related to diabetic neuropathy in the lower extremities, despite previous treatment(s).

 Subjects will be assessed with the Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score at screening, to evaluate the severity of peripheral neuropathy for inclusion.

 Eligible subjects will be entered into a 14-day ePRO diary run-in period to collect average baseline pain scores related to their diabetic neuropathy in the lower extremities, diary compliance, and analgesic consumption (maintenance and prn prescribed peripheral neuropathic pain medication pill counts).

 Subjects will collect electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data each morning around the same time during the run-in period.

 Only those subjects having a mean pain intensity in the lower extremities of 4 and 70% during the 14-day run-in period will be eligible.

 Subjects will return to the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) for review of eligibility, diary compliance, average baseline diabetic neuropathic pain score of 4 and 2 hours and 8pm 2 hours) for 120 days.

 Subjects will record electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data following each morning treatment for 120 days.

 Subjects consenting to distal thigh and distal leg skin biopsies during the Screening visit will have biopsies collected and sent to the central laboratory for assessment.

 All subjects will have a baseline Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP), Sural Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), and will complete the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAIQ), and NeuroQoL.

 Subjects will receive a telephone call at Day 7 to ensure compliance to treatment and diary completion, provide follow-up information on the biopsy sites (if applicable), complete a blinding assessment as well as be assessed for safety and concomitant medication changes.

 At Month 1 subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant medication changes, review device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary completion, and Patient Global Impression (PGI).

 Treatment satisfaction will also be assessed.

 At Month 2 subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant medication changes, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary completion, quality of life outcomes (WPAIQ and NeuroQoL), Patient Global Impression (PGI), and interim visit measurements of SPP.

 At Month 3, subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant medication changes, review device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary completion, and Patient Global Impression (PGI).

 Treatment satisfaction will also be assessed.

 At Month 4 (end of Part A / start of Part B), subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be supplied to the site), HbA1c, concomitant medication changes, weight, quality of life outcomes (WPAIQ and NeuroQoL), PGI, final measurements of SPP, NCS, QST and be assessed to determine their Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score.

 Those subjects who consented and had biopsies collected at the Enrollment visit, will have their end of study biopsies during this visit and samples sent directly to the central laboratory for assessment.

 Subjects will return the study device and complete a blinding assessment.

 Subjects that complete Part A will continue into the open-label extension period (Part B).

 All subjects will be given an open-label active device.

 Subjects will continue to record ePRO data following each morning treatment and will be reminded of the 150-day (Month 5) phone call.

 At Month 5, subjects will receive a telephone call to ensure compliance to treatment and diary completion, and to be assessed for safety and concomitant medication changes.

 At Month 6 (end of open-label treatment extension), subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, NCS, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be supplied to the site), concomitant medication changes, quality of life outcomes (NeuroQoL), and will return the study device.

 Dual Field PEMF Therapy in Lower Extremity Painful Diabetic Distal Symmetric Peripheral Neuropathy@highlight

Part A of this trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

 Part A will evaluate PEMF treatment compared to sham treatment in patients with painful diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) when treatment is administered 30 minutes twice daily through a 120-day period (4 months).

 Part B is a 2-month open-label active treatment extension period designed to collect longer-term data on pain, medication use, quality of life and safety (Part B).

Part B of this trial is a an extension period upon completion of Part A.
