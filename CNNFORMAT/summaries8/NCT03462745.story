(fifthQuint)A Comparison of the First Attempt Success Rate of Cannulation Between the Accuvein Apparatus and Standard Technique.

 Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided informed consent were assigned to one of two groups using a randomization program that assigned research participants into group A (AccuVein AV300 assisted intravenous catheter insertion) or group B (standard technique of insertion of the intravenous cannula).

 After pre-anesthetic evaluation, the research participant was brought to the operating room and standard monitoring were applied (EKG, SpO2, BP) if tolerated.

 Anesthesia was induced via face mask with sevoflurane in 100% O2.

 The anesthesiologist and resident decided on a site believed to be the best for cannulation and on the size of the venous cannula as 22g or 24g.

 When the supervising anesthesiologist deemed it appropriate, the venous cannulation was attempted, according to the randomization groups, either with the AccuVein device (group A) or blindly (group B).

 A rating of the vein attempted as either difficult or easy was established by the attending anesthesiologist.

 A Comparison of the First Attempt Success Rate of Cannulation Between the Accuvein Apparatus and Standard Technique@highlight

Background: The AccuVein AV300 device helps in venepuncture and intravenous (IV) cannulation.

 It uses infrared light that can be absorbed by the blood hemoglobin so that veins location is clearly viewed on the skin's surface.

 Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the AV300 device over the standard technique in increasing the first-time success rate (SR) for pediatric patients who needed IV cannulation.

 Methods: This was a prospective cross study of patients aged 0-18 years scheduled for surgery or examination under anesthesia but without having an existing IV access and after providing consent form.

 Patients were randomized into two groups; cannulation with AV300 or standard insertion performed by experienced pediatric anesthesiologists and residents under training.
