(secondQuint)Efficacy of Reza Band for the Treatment of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux.

 Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), the back flow of gastric contents into the laryngopharynx, contributes to several otolaryngologic symptoms, inflammatory disorders, and even neoplastic diseases of the laryngopharynx.

 It is estimated that this disease effects 20 - 40% of the United States population and appears to be as common in children and infants as adults.

 It is widely accepted that chronic reflux into the esophagus causes inflammation (reflux esophagitis; gastro- esophageal reflux disease - GERD) which can, over time, result in a metaplastic change in the cells that line the lower esophagus - Barrett's esophagus - which confers an increased risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma.

 It is strongly thought that chronic uncontrolled LPR not only causes inflammatory, but perhaps also neoplastic pathologies in the laryngopharynx, as it does in the esophagus.

 Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is the mainstay of treatment for GERD.

 However, their efficacy for the treatment of airway reflux, including LPR, remains doubtful.

 In fact, placebo-controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any therapeutic benefit of PPIs for the treatment of LPR.

 Combined multi-channel intraluminal impedance - pH monitoring (MII-pH) represented a major advance in diagnosing airway reflux by its ability to detect reflux events independent of the pH of the refluxate.

 By demonstrating the inefficacy of acid-targeting therapeutics for LPR, association of symptoms with nonacid reflux, and symptom alleviation upon surgical intervention that abrogates reflux of all gastric contents, the data garnered through MII-pH technology brought about a shift in perception of LPR and airway reflux as primarily acid-mediated disease, to one that can be significantly mediated by nonacid components of reflux for which typical GERD treatment would not suffice.

 Approximately $26 billion/year is currently spent on PPIs for the treatment of LPR, despite their poor efficacy for this patient population.

 Reza band, a non-medication, non-surgical medical device designed to reduce symptoms of LPR has recently been approved by the FDA.

 It works by stopping the flow of gastric contents through the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) by increasing the internal pressure of the UES.

 The investigators propose a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of Reza band for LPR using pepsin as the primary outcome measure.

 Pepsin, a gastric proteolytic enzyme initially synthesized and secreted as the zymogen pepsinogen by chief cells in the gastric fundus and subsequently cleaved in an autocatalytic fashion to produce the mature form of pepsin upon introduction to the acidic environment of the stomach lumen, has been shown by this group and others to be a specific and sensitive biomarker for gastric reflux and aspiration.

 While many episodes of LPR are weakly acidic or nonacid, pepsin is present in all refluxate.

 The investigators have previously reported pepsin in laryngeal epithelia from 26/27 pH-confirmed LPR patents, not detected in 19 control subjects (p 13 and RFS 7) will receive standard of care Reza band for 12 weeks (30 patients per group).

 In addition to the routine clinical outcome measures for LPR: RSI and RFS, salivary pepsin, tissue (post-cricoid) pepsin and inflammatory cytokine profile will be documented pre- and post-treatment and compared between the two patient cohorts.

 Pepsin and inflammatory cytokine profile will be measured using an established in-house and commercially available ELISA respectively.

 This pilot study will pave the way for clinical trials of a much-needed therapy for airway reflux.

 If the hypothesis proves true and the Reza band resolves pepsin and inflammatory cytokines, and significantly improves endoscopic signs (RFS) and symptoms (RSI) of LPR, these data will also support a clinical trial to assess the utility of the Reza band in preventing reflux attributed laryngeal inflammatory and neoplastic disease sequelae.

 Efficacy of Reza Band for the Treatment of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux@highlight

Hypothesis: 1.

 Tissue and salivary pepsin will resolve after 12 weeks use of Reza band, but not following standard of care alone.

 2.

 RFS, RSI and inflammatory cytokines (IL -1, -6, and -8) will decrease to normative levels following 12 week use of Reza band, but not with standard of care alone.
