(secondQuint)Air Barrier System for the Reduction of Airborne Colony Forming Units During Total Knee Arthroplasty.

 The Air Barrier System (ABS) is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery site from ambient airborne contamination.

 This study examines the hypothesis that the ABS can reduce the presence of airborne CFU at the surgery site during total knee arthroplasty surgery.
