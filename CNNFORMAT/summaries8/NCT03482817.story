 Current data indicate that St.

 John's wort preparations may induce hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and transport proteins.

 This can result in drug interactions.

 The study design is standard for DDI studies and is based on the regulatory guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

 A cocktail approach involving the administration of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP)- or P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-specific probe drugs is used to simultaneously assess the activities of these enzymes and the transporter P-gp.
