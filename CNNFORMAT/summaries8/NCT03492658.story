(secondQuint)Abatacept to Silence Anti-citrullinated Protein Antibody-expressing B Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis (ASCARA).

 B cells expressing anti citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) display an activated, proliferative phenotype.

 Experimental data indicate that ACPA and ACPA-expressing B cells are actively involved in driving the disease process in RA.

 The present study is based on the hypothesis that targeted intervention with CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) as a means to interfere with T cell help for B cells in early, active, ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis can reverse the activated, proliferative phenotype of citrullinated antigen-specific B cells.

 Abatacept to Silence Anti-citrullinated Protein Antibody-expressing B Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis (ASCARA)@highlight

To investigate the effect of CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) on phenotype, transcriptional profile, B cell receptor usage and functional parameters of circulating B cells expressing anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in patients with early, methotrexate-naive, ACPA positive rheumatoid arthritis.
