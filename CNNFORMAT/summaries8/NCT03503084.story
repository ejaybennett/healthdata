(thirdQuint)Short-term Effects of Tai Chi Chuan Exercise on the Regulation of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms and Endothelial Function.

 Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) has been shown to be beneficial to the health.

 However, its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism are not fully understood.

 This study investigated the short term effect of TCC exercise on lipid and glucose metabolism and endothelial function in TCC practitioners.

 Twenty-one TCC practitioners and nineteen normal controls were included in this study.

 The hemodynamics, serum insulin, indices of insulin resistance/sensitivity, serum endothelin-1 (ET-1), blood lipids and aldosterone before and 30 min after a rest or a session of classical Yang's TCC exercise were compared.

 Short-term Effects of Tai Chi Chuan Exercise on the Regulation of Lipid and Glucose Metabolisms and Endothelial Function@highlight

The short term effects of TCC exercise are the significant increase in serum insulin and insulin resistance, and the significant decrease in serum TC, HDL-C, ET-1 and insulin sensitivity in TCC practitioners.

 TCC might be benefit the health of its practitioners through the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism and endothelial function.
