(secondQuint)Reducing Risk for Alzheimer's Disease in High-Risk Women Through Yogic Meditation Training.

 Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 100 women (50 or older) with MCI and high Alzheimer's disease risk.

 Subjects will either receive: (1) MET class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and "Kirtan Kriya" meditation class for 60 minutes per week.

 Assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions at 6 and 12 weeks and follow-up visits at week 24 and 48 to monitor the overall benefit of the intervention.
