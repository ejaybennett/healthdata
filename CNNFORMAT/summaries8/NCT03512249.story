(fifthQuint)A Phase 2, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Prevention of Recurrence (POR).

 This is a phase 2, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups.

 - H56:IC31 (investigational vaccine) - Placebo 900 HIV-negative adults with a diagnosis of drug susceptible pulmonary TB are planned to be included, recruited from TB clinics with established relationships to the trial sites at the start of their TB treatment.

 4 trial sites are planned in South Africa (ZA): 1 site in Klerksdorp at the Aurum Institute and 3 sites in Cape Town at TASK, UCT Lung Institute and SATVI.

 1 trial site is planned in Tanzania (TZ): Mbeya at NIMR.

 Preclinical data suggest H56:IC31 may be more efficacious if administered while patients are still on treatment.

 Following the national guidelines for TB treatment in South Africa and Tanzania, we will obtain sputum samples from patients towards the end of treatment at about the same time they are obtained within the national TB control programmes, and if the sputum is smear negative, the criterion for successful treatment within TB programmes, the individual will be eligible for randomization and vaccination towards the end of their six-month treatment period.

 As this is a proof of concept TB vaccine study, HIV positive individuals have been excluded as it is not yet known what effect HIV infection may have on the immune response to the vaccine.

 However, HIV positive individuals are an important population to include in future studies should efficacy be demonstrated in this study.
