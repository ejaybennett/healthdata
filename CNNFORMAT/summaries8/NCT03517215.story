(fifthQuint)The Development and Testing of a Scaling Strategy for a Community-Based Primary Care Antimicrobial Stewardship Program.

 Antimicrobial resistance is evolving globally.

 The latest `superbug', plasmid mediated colistin resistant E.

coli (MDR-1), identified in North America highlights this.

 Previously, colistin was the drug of last resort that could be used for organisms resistant to all other antibiotics.

 Current projections are that by 2050, there will be 10 million deaths annually from antimicrobial resistant infections, and this will exceed deaths from cancer.

 Antibiotic overuse is considered a main factor in promoting antimicrobial resistance.

 Countries with high volumes of antibiotic use have higher levels of resistant organisms.

 After a single antibiotic course, a person's risk of acquiring an antimicrobial resistant infection is increased.

 Recognizing the need for action to address this crisis, governments in the United States and Canada have issued recent policy statements calling for, among other actions, reductions in antibiotic overuse.

 Over 80% of antibiotics in Canada are prescribed in the community for common respiratory and other infections.

 Currently, this amounts to one antibiotic prescription issued for every 6 Canadians each year.

 In an ongoing 2014-15 Innovation Fund grant (Community ASP-Phase 1), a team of infectious disease experts and pharmacists with hospital ASP experience, community family physicians working in primary care clinics, and researchers with expertise in community infections collaboratively developed a Community-Based Primary Care Antimicrobial Stewardship Program(CB-ASP).

 Preliminary results (presented below) show positive effects on key antibiotic utilization parameters.

 What is needed now is a strategy to `scale' this program up to similar clinics province wide.

 This will be necessary to achieve the reduction in the volumes of antibiotic use needed to reduce resistance.

 Exactly the optimal way to do this and what resources will be needed is not known.

 Providing the answers to these questions are the objectives of this proposal (CB-ASP -Phase 2).

 Objectives - This study will seek to determine the best way for the developed CB-ASP to be successfully scaled up to other family medicine clinics, by testing strategies that are resourced with different intensities, utilizing an innovative primary care research platform.

 Study Design - This study will be a 9-month cluster randomized trial over one winter of a less resource intensive and more resource intensive scaling strategy for disseminating a Community-Based Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (CB-ASP) in 6 clinics within a network (UTOPIAN) of linked primary care practices, stratified by small verses large urban center.

 This study will test different levels of support (resources provided) in delivering a clinic-based, educational, community-focused ASP intervention directed at family physicians and nurse practitioners.

 These health professionals are licensed to prescribe antibiotics in these settings.

 The Development and Testing of a Scaling Strategy for a Community-Based Primary Care Antimicrobial Stewardship Program@highlight

Antibiotic resistant infections are expected to cause 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050, and exceed cancer deaths.

 Reducing antibiotic use can reduce resistance levels.

 Hospitals have now developed Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs that promote better use of antibiotics.

 However, 80% of antibiotics are prescribed in the community where stewardship programs do not exist.

 Antibiotics are often prescribed for coughs and colds, where it can be difficult to tell if these are cases of pneumonia or strep throat.

 Doctors may prescribe antibiotics `just in case' and patients may request antibiotics hoping to feel better faster.

 To help family doctors and patients, a team of infectious disease specialists, researchers and community family physicians have collaboratively developed an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) for use in the community.

 Testing in 3 family medicine clinics is showing reduced antibiotic use.

 What is needed is a strategy to `scale' up this program province wide to reduce antibiotic use enough to reduce resistance levels, but how to do this is not known.

 Working with a community clinic network, this project will test two implementation strategies to inform how best to implement a Community-Based ASP.
