(fifthQuint)Pre-Competition Carbohydrate Supplementation.

 The study will be conducted at the "Team Base" training center, located in the western zone of Rio de Janeiro.

 All procedures were performed under standard conditions (temperature: 21-23 C, relative humidity: 40-60%).

 Participants were previously instructed not to perform vigorous exercise 24 hours prior to data collection and to fast 8 hours prior.

 All procedures will be performed in one day.

 Before the study procedures, participants will be evaluated for anthropometric characteristics using a scale (GAMA ITALY(R) brand) and a portable stadiometer (Sanny(R) brand, Personal model).

 Then, manual palmar grip strength (FPM) will be measured in pre and post fight moments.

 And, after the fight will also be verified the participants' perception of effort through the adapted Borg scale.

 Procedures Fights The struggles (Handori) began respecting the schedules stipulated between the components of the same group.

 Thus, each fight lasted five minutes, without intervals, where the athletes were instructed to perform dynamic movements, and maintain high movement, aiming to raise the intensity to the maximum during this period.

 Carbohydrate Supplementation For the administration of carbohydrate supplementation, the "Advanced Nutrition(R)" pack containing 30g (1 sachet), energy of 83kcal = 349kJ, carbohydrates 21g, sodium 82mg, vitamin C 4, 2mg and vitamin E 0.

90mg.

 Palmar Manual Holding Force (FPM) Measurement of the Manual Holding Force (FPM) was performed using the JAMAR(R) analog hydraulic dynamometer (Asimow Engineering(R), USA), with an accuracy of 0.

5 kg / f and a maximum capacity of 100 kg / f.

 Thus, the position suggested by the American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT) [8] was used, with the participants positioned in a seated position with their hips and knees at 90 flexion, shoulder in adduction, elbow flexed at 90 , wrist and forearm in neutral position.

 The participant was instructed to perform the greatest possible force and the peak value was subsequently recorded.

 Modified Borg Scale Perceived exertion was assessed using the Adapted BORG Scale [7] consisting of an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents none and 10 represents maximum intensity.

 The following standardized question preceded the application of the scale: "How do you rate the intensity of the exercise performed?" Statistical analysis Mean and standard deviation values were calculated for all variables.

 The normality of the data was initially analyzed by the Komolgorov-Smirnov procedure.

 In addition, t-test was used to compare moments and groups.

 All statistical analysis assumed a significance level of 5%.

 The analyzes were conducted using the statistical package SPSS (2.

0).

 Pre-Competition Carbohydrate Supplementation@highlight

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the MPF and the perception of effort of professional jiu jitsu athletes from carbohydrate intake at different moments.

 Twelve jiu jitsu athletes participated in the study, being randomly divided into three groups of four participants: Control Group (CG); Experimental group 1 (G1), supplementation immediately before the fight and Experimental group 2 (G2), supplementation 30 minutes before the fight.

 The FPM measurement was performed with the JAMAR(R) brand analog hydraulic dynamometer in the pre-fight moments and immediately after the fight.

 The intensity perception of the effort was verified through the adapted Borg scale after the fight.

 Regarding the findings on muscle strength, there were different outcomes between the groups analyzed.
