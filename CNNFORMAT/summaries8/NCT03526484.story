(firstQuint)The Utility of Urinalysis Prior to In-Office Procedures.

 OVERVIEW: Current urology practice requires every patient to have a urinalysis lab done prior to any in-office procedures.

 If the patient's urinalysis is positive, they are then required to have a urine culture done, which takes 1-3 days to show results, and they may also be prescribed antibiotics.

 This practice may cause diagnostic delays, unnecessary cancellations of procedures, and the overuse of antibiotics.

 The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of urinalysis labs and urine cultures in patients prior to in-office cystoscopies, intravesical BCG treatments, and prostate biopsies.

 We predict there is no difference in the number of cases of urinary tract infections in patients that undergo in-office procedures with or without a prior urinalysis.

 We purpose a change in protocol could allow for improved clinical efficiency, antibiotic stewardship, and be economically advantageous.

 OUTLINE: Patients will be randomly assigned to either have a urinalysis or urine culture performed before their in-office procedure.

 They will have follow up questionnaires seven days and thirty days after their procedure.
