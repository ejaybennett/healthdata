(secondQuint)A Crowd Sourcing Platform for Patients With Cancer.

 The core hypothesis tested by this study is that engaging researchers, clinicians and patients in an online knowledge sharing platform will enable patients to better understand cancer, better inform treatment decisions made by oncologists and accelerate cancer research.

 Leftover samples from patients with cancer (blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues collected for clinical purposes) will be obtained and sent for various types of analyses and results will be shared on the All4Cure website.
