(fifthQuint)Reducing Binge Eating to Prevent Weight Gain in Black Women.

 Aim 1.

 Using an experimental design, examine the feasibility and acceptability of 6-month AAT (N=40) in North Carolina.

 Forty overweight and obese (BMI 25 kg/m) community-based Black women will be randomized to the AAT intervention or wait-list control (who will eventually receive the intervention).

 AAT participants will meet weekly for 8 weeks, followed by a 4-month period of daily weighing and weekly tailored feedback only.

 The study will examine the following: recruitment feasibility, attendance/retention, adherence, satisfaction, and barriers to completion.

 Aim 2: At 2 and 6 months, compare changes in (a) binge eating, eating self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms and (b) weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference for participants in the intervention vs.

 control group.

 H_1: Participants in the AAT intervention will report less binge and overeating and gain less weight than those in the control group at 2 and 6 months.

 Secondary aim: Examine characteristics (e.

g.

, baseline BMI, severity of binge eating, frequency of self-weighing) related to change in binge eating and weight.

 Reducing Binge Eating to Prevent Weight Gain in Black Women@highlight

The purpose of the proposed study is to pilot a 6-month, cognitive-behavioral binge eating intervention, Appetite Awareness Training (AAT) to reduce binge eating and prevent weight gain for Black women with a BMI > 25 kg/m and with weekly binge eating episodes.

 Intervention participants will receive a 8-week group AAT intervention, and will also receive bluetooth-connected scales for daily weighing.

 Participants will also receive tailored feedback on self-weighing frequency and weight change.

 We will follow-up with participants at six months.
