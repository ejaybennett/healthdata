(firstQuint)Effect of Cherry Concentrate on Brain Activation and Perfusion in Healthy Older Adults.

 The investigators will perform a double blind, randomised controlled study to determine whether cherry polyphenols improve peripheral vascular function and cerebral perfusion resulting in improved task related brain activation and cognitive function.

 30 healthy elderly men and women 60-85y years will be recruited to complete 8-week supplementation with MC concentrate or an isoenergetic cherry placebo concentrate.

 Participants will be pair matched for age, sex, and cognitive function (Adenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III, ACE-III) and then randomised using a sealed envelope system to receive either placebo or cherry.
