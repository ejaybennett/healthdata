(secondQuint)By Comparing TPF Induction Chemotherapy Combined With Nimotuzumab Concurrent Radiotherapy and Cisplatin Concurrent Radio-chemotherapy for Locally Advanced NPC.

 TPF program is currently the local advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma commonly used inducing chemotherapy, cisplatin is the preferred drug for the same period chemotherapy, however, due to heavier gastrointestinal reactions caused by cisplatin, direct damage to renal parenchymal and other adverse reactions often lead to anti-tumor therapy can not be smooth Carried out, resulting in treatment failure, thus affecting the survival of patients.

In this study, Phase II clinical trials were performed.

 Patients with locally advanced local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma were randomly divided into experimental group and control group.

The trial group was treated with TPF regimen induction chemotherapy combined with nimotuzumab concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

 The control group was treated with TPF regimen induction chemotherapy combined with Cisplatin concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

, observed and compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two treatment to assess its safety and patient tolerance.
