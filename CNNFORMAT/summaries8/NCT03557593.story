(secondQuint)Optimizing Prescribing of Antipsychotics in Long-Term Care.

 Increasing numbers of older adults are affected by dementia, and many will eventually reside in long-term care (LTC), where antipsychotic use is relatively common.

 Inappropriate antipsychotic prescribing is a key quality indicator by which clinical outcomes might be monitored and improved in LTC but limited evidence exists on the most effective strategies for reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use.

 The objective of the study was to evaluate a multicomponent approach to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotics in LTC.

 A prospective, randomized stepped-wedge, study design was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention in 10 LTC facilities in Canada.

 The intervention consisted of an educational in-service, provision of evidence-based tools to assess and monitor neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and monthly interprofessional team meetings.
