(fifthQuint)Feasibility in France of a Mindfulness-based Group Therapy for Adolescents With Chronic Pain.

 Paediatric chronic pain can lead to serious consequences in terms of daily functioning (school absenteeism and loss of social interactions) and global quality of life.

 Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI's) approaches which emphasize acceptance rather than control of pain have gained increasing attention in adults with chronic pain.

 The effectiveness of MBI's for chronic pain in paediatric population remains largely unknown.

 An MBI program for adolescent was conducted in Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and happened to be feasible and well received for adolescents with chronic pain conditions.

 The aim of Peacefull program is to study the feasibility in France of a mindfulness program dedicated for adolescents with chronic pain.

 An eight-session, two hour Mindfulness Based Intervention dedicated to adolescents will be provided.

 The intervention will focus on skill building and will incorporate mindfulness meditation, exercises and activities specially adapted to teenagers with chronic pain.

 Topics will include mind body connection, the effect of stress on pain, living in the present moment, focused awareness, responding versus reacting to pain and/ or difficult situations, non judgement, gratitude, kindness and compassion towards self and others.
