(secondQuint)Tanglewood to Table: A Walking Farmer's Market Group and Control.

 In the summer of 2018, community members of Whitesburg, Kentucky (KY) were recruited to join the Tanglewood to Table walking program, and community members of Harlan, KY were invited to serve as controls.

 Each Thursday or Saturday, participants report whether or not they walked the 1 mile trail to the farmers market, how many steps the walked in the previous 7 days and they reported which fruits and vegetables they consumed the previous week.

 The control group will receive nutrition education handouts.

 The program is from June 2018 - January 2019.

 Participants complete questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity.

 Participants also provided physical and biological measurements.

 Recruiting for the 2018 Walking Program will begin in May.
