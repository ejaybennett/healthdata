(thirdQuint)Small-Volume Tubes to Reduce Anemia and Transfusion.

 Blood sampling can cause significant unnecessary blood loss particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU).

 Blood loss contributes to anemia which is highly prevalent in the ICU and is associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death.

 Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to correct anemia also have significant health risks.

 Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, the specific aim of the STRATUS study is to evaluate whether the routine use of small-volume blood collection tubes reduces RBC transfusion compared to standard-volume blood collection tubes in adult ICU patients.

 Small-Volume Tubes to Reduce Anemia and Transfusion@highlight

STRATUS will evaluate the use of small-volume ("soft-draw") blood collection tubes for laboratory testing in reducing anemia and transfusion in intensive care unit patients without significant adverse consequences.

 This is a simple, cost-neutral intervention that could improve the quality of patient care and reduce the harms of frequent laboratory testing.
