(fifthQuint)Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Nimodipine for the Neurological Manifestations of HIV-1.

 HIV-infected patients may develop a condition known as HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex (also known as AIDS dementia complex) that causes damage to the nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord.

 Evidence exists that nimodipine protects nerve cells in culture from injury by HIV.

 Although nimodipine has been used in patients with other neurological problems, its safety and effectiveness in halting the progression of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex is not yet known.

 Forty patients currently taking zidovudine (AZT) or any other approved antiretroviral agent will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: high-dose nimodipine, low-dose nimodipine, or placebo.

 Additionally, six patients who are intolerant to standard antiretroviral therapy will be randomized to receive high- or low-dose nimodipine.

 Nimodipine is administered by mouth concurrently with patients' prestudy dose of antiretroviral agent.

 Treatment is given for 16 weeks, and patients are followed every 4 weeks.

 As an option, all patients may receive an additional 16 weeks of low-dose nimodipine.

 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Nimodipine for the Neurological Manifestations of HIV-1@highlight

PRIMARY: To assess the safety of nimodipine in the treatment of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex (formerly AIDS dementia complex).

 To assess the systemic or central nervous system toxicities (e.

g.

, rash, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea, dyspnea, muscle pain or cramp, acne) of nimodipine.

 SECONDARY: To assess the efficacy of nimodipine in stabilizing the progression of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex by improvement in neuropsychological test performance, peripheral neuropathy, or other neurologic manifestations.
