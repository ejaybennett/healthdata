(fifthQuint)A Pilot Study of Allogeneic Lymphocyte Transfer in HIV Infection.

 There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes.

 However, more controlled studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of therapy.

 Lymphocytes obtained by leukapheresis from a healthy, HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult offspring of the HIV-infected patient are infused at day 0 and at weeks 4 and 8.

 A small portion of the lymphocytes obtained at day 0 will be radiolabeled prior to infusion, and two total body scans will be performed.

 Patients also undergo two tonsillar biopsies.

 Patients are followed weekly for 16 weeks, then by telephone periodically for 3 years (at 1 year, 2 years, 2.

5 years, and 3 years).

 A Pilot Study of Allogeneic Lymphocyte Transfer in HIV Infection@highlight

To examine, in HIV-infected patients, the safety of allogeneic lymphocyte transfer (i.

e.

, infusion of white blood cells taken from an HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult offspring who has a compatible blood type).

 To measure the distribution and survival of allogeneic lymphocytes in the circulation of HIV-infected patients, and to determine whether their infusion results in enhanced immunity.

 To determine whether enhanced immunity is passively transferred or actively induced.

 There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes.

 However, more controlled studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of therapy.
