(fifthQuint)A Phase I, Multicenter, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-Derived MN HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (rgp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus at Two Different Vaccination Schedules.

 A gp160 vaccine developed from the IIIB strain of HIV-1 has been found to be safe and immunogenic in healthy adults.

 Since the MN strain of HIV-1 is representative of a larger proportion of HIV-1 isolates in the United States than is the IIIB strain, evaluation of a gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain is important.

 Volunteers are randomized to receive 200 mcg MN rgp160 or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6 or at months 0, 2, and 8.

 For each immunization schedule, ten volunteers receive vaccine and two volunteers receive placebo.

 Per amendment, volunteers receive a fourth immunization of 800 or 200 mcg (or placebo) at 9 or 11 months after the third injection (i.

e.

, at month 17) and are followed for 6 months afterward.

To determine the safety and immunogenicity of 200 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) versus placebo, administered on two immunization schedules to healthy volunteers.
