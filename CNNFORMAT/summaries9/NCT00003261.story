(thirdQuint)Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With HIV-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma patients.

 - Evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate IV administered on day 1 and high-dose zidovudine IV administered on days 1-3 every 2 weeks.

 Patients receive 3 courses of therapy.

 Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to the lesion site daily.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central nervous system lymphoma.
