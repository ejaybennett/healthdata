(thirdQuint)International Programs Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center.

 BACKGROUND: Computer processing, biostatistical, and epidemiological services at the Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center (CSCC) had been funded previously as part of the NHLBI Lipid Research Clinics (LRC) contracts.

 In FY 1990, contract N01HV08112 was awarded separately from the LRC for the first time and provided services for collaborative studies carried out under NHLBI international bilateral agreements with the USSR, Poland, and the People's Republic of China.

 The assistance has provided important contributions to large-scale, international epidemiological studies resulting from bilateral agreements between the United States and other countries.

 The results of these efforts have provided insights into different disease patterns and trends throughout the world.

 DESIGN NARRATIVE: The CSCC coordinated data collection and data file transfer, coordinated scientific meetings, visited the collaborating countries, hosted collaborative scientists, and directed data analysis, combining data from all countries.
