(thirdQuint)Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Untreated Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Assess the therapeutic activity of docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

 - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

 Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and cisplatin in treating patients who have untreated stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.
