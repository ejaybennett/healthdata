(secondQuint)Cryosurgery in Treating Women With Breast Lesions.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility of temperature-monitored, ultrasound-guided cryosurgery in women with highly suspicious breast lesions.

 - Determine the safety of this procedure in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo cryoablation of up to two breast lesions.

 Within 3-21 days, patients undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy.

 Patients are followed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after lumpectomy or mastectomy.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.

 Cryosurgery in Treating Women With Breast Lesions@highlight

RATIONALE: Cryosurgery kills cancer cells by freezing them.

 Cryosurgery followed by lumpectomy or mastectomy may be an effective treatment for breast lesions.

 PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cryosurgery in treating women who have breast lesions.
