(thirdQuint)Celecoxib Compared With No Treatment Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - Compare biomarker modulation (prostaglandin levels) in tissue samples of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant celecoxib vs placebo followed by prostatectomy.

 - Compare the effect of these regimens on angiogenic factors within the prostate in these patients.

 - Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of celecoxib in these patients.

 - Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

 - Compare the compliance of patients treated with these regimens.

 OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

 Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 - Arm I: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant celecoxib twice daily.

 - Arm II: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant placebo twice daily.

 Treatment in both arms continues for at least 4 weeks followed by prostatectomy.

 Patients are followed within 1 month and then at 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients (at least 30 per arm) will be accrued for this study.

 Celecoxib Compared With No Treatment Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be an effective treatment for early stage prostate cancer.

 It is not yet known if celecoxib is more effective than no treatment before surgery for prostate cancer.

 PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of celecoxib given before surgery to remove the prostate in treating patients who have localized prostate cancer.
