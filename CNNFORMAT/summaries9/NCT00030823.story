(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients at High Risk for Breast Cancer Recurrence.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether immunization with multiple antigens comprising GM2, Globo-H, Lewis y, TF(c), sTn(c), Tn(c), and glycosylated MUC-1 32(aa) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin plus QS21 induces an antibody response against these individual antigens and breast cancer cells expressing these antigens in patients at high risk for breast cancer recurrence.

 - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive Globo-H-GM2-Lewis-y-MUC1-32(aa)-sTn(c)-TF(c)-Tn(c)-KLH conjugate vaccine with QS21 adjuvant subcutaneously weekly on weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 19.

 Patients are followed every 3 months.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 months.

 Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients at High Risk for Breast Cancer Recurrence@highlight

RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response and decrease the recurrence of breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: Pilot trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who are at high risk for breast cancer recurrence.
