(firstQuint)Treatment of Depression in Parkinson's Disease Trial.

 Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 It causes immense personal suffering and is associated with increased disability and caregiver burden.

 Despite the adverse consequences of depression in patients with PD, there are virtually no empirical data to guide clinical treatment.

 This study will begin to answer some questions on the treatment of depression by testing a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressant, paroxetine, a tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline, and placebo in a placebo-controlled trial.

 A total of 75 patients with PD will be randomized to each of the three arms in a balanced design.
