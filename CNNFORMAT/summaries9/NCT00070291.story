(secondQuint)Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with recurrent or refractory angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma treated with cyclosporine.

 Secondary - Determine the disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

 - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily for up to 36 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression during weeks 1-6.

 Patients experiencing disease progression during weeks 7-36, receive an additional 36 weeks of therapy.

 Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.

5 years.

RATIONALE: Cyclosporine may help the immune system slow the growth of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cyclosporine works in treating patients with recurrent or refractory angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.
