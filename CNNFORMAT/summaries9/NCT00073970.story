(thirdQuint)Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer Following Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of celecoxib on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with prostate cancer in biochemical relapse after prior definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy.

 - Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs historical controls.

 - Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs pretreatment PSA values.

 - Determine the time to clinical recurrence in patients treated with this drug.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

 Treatment continues for 5 years in the absence of disease progression.

 Patients may continue treatment beyond 5 years at the discretion of the treating physician.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

 PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who have relapsed prostate cancer following radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.
