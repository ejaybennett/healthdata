(thirdQuint)Genetic Study to Identify Gene Mutations in Participants Previously Enrolled in Clinical Trial NCI-99-C-0053 Who Have Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome or Are at Risk for Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.

 OBJECTIVES: - Obtain laboratory identification and confirmation of research results for gene mutations in participants previously enrolled in NCI-99-C-0053 who have von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome or who are at risk for VHL syndrome.

 - Determine genotype status in these participants.

 OUTLINE: Participants submit a blood or buccal sample for genetic mutation analysis.

 Participants may receive genetic counseling and/or the results of genetic testing, if desired.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 260 participants will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: The identification of gene mutations in individuals who have or are at risk for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome may allow doctors to better determine the genetic processes involved in the development of cancer.

 PURPOSE: This genetic study is finding gene mutations in participants with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome or who are at risk for developing von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
