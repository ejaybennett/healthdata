(thirdQuint)Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil in Preventing Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Cancer Who Are Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplantation.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in preventing acute graft-vs-host disease in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

 Secondary - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

 Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily on days -1 to 60 followed by a taper to day 180.

 Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours or orally twice daily on days 0-60 followed by a taper to day 180.

 Treatment is discontinued at day 180 in the absence of graft-vs-host disease.

 Patients are followed for survival.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study.

RATIONALE: Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil may be an effective treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by donor stem cell transplantation.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving tacrolimus together with mycophenolate mofetil works in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease in patients who are undergoing donor stem cell transplantation for advanced hematologic cancer.
