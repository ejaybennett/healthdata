(fifthQuint)Safety and Effectiveness of Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate Combined With Chemotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors.

 This is a phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Combretastatin A4 Phosphate (CA4P) combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

 Treatment is for a maximum of 6 consecutive 21-day cycles.

 Patients are randomized onto one of two CA4P dosing arms (45 or 63 mg/m2).

 CA4P is administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle.

 Carboplatin and paclitaxel (AUC 6 and 200 mg/m2, respectively) are administered on day 2 of each cycle.

 At least 2 DCE-MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the change in tumor blood flow following treatment with CA4P.

 Safety and Effectiveness of Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate Combined With Chemotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This is a study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Combretastatin A4 Phosphate (CA4P) combined with the chemotherapy drugs, carboplatin and paclitaxel.

 The full treatment and observation time should be about 5 months.

 During this time the patient should receive 18 CA4P infusions and 6 carboplatin followed by paclitaxel treatments.

 Patients will be randomized into one of two CA4P dose-level groups in order to recommend a preferred dose-level for future studies.

 At least 2 dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans will be conducted to monitor the blood flow through the tumor before and after treatment with CA4P.
