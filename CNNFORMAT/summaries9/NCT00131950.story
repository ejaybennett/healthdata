(thirdQuint)Effect of Lifestyle Factors and Hormone Function on Breast Density in Healthy Hispanic Women Who Are Undergoing Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening.

 OBJECTIVES: - Correlate physical activity, diet, and obesity, as measured by body mass index and waist circumference, with percent breast density and the absolute estimate of total dense breast area in healthy Hispanic women undergoing screening mammography.

 - Correlate fasting serum insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and the molar ratio of IGF-1 to IGF binding protein-3 with breast density in participants undergoing screening mammography.

 - Correlate insulin concentration and insulin resistance with breast density in participants undergoing screening mammography.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Participants undergo blood collection and physical examination.

 Participants also complete breast cancer risk factor, food frequency, and physical activity questionnaires and receive breast health and physical activity education.

 Participants then undergo a digital screening mammogram.

 Participants are notified of mammogram results.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 114 participants will be accrued for this study.

 Effect of Lifestyle Factors and Hormone Function on Breast Density in Healthy Hispanic Women Who Are Undergoing Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening@highlight

RATIONALE: Lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, diet, and obesity, and hormone function may affect breast density.

 Screening tests, such as mammography, may help doctors find tumor cells early and plan better treatment for breast cancer.

 PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of lifestyle factors and hormone function on breast density in healthy Hispanic women who are undergoing mammography for breast cancer screening.
