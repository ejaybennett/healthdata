(thirdQuint)Impact of Prenatal Vitamin/Mineral Supplements on Perinatal Mortality.

 In the project area in China, the rate of perinatal mortality (stillbirths and infant deaths within 6 days of birth) is two times that of the United States.

 Causes of perinatal mortality include, but are not limited to, low birth weight and preterm delivery.

 Anemia (low hemoglobin) among pregnant women is associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery and also is elevated in the project area.

 Supplements of iron, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals can prevent anemia among pregnant women, but the effects of these supplements on other maternal and infant health outcomes are unclear.

 Since 1993, the People's Republic of China has recommended that newly married women, and those who plan pregnancy, take 4001/2g of folic acid daily through the first trimester of pregnancy.

 Although WHO recommends that pregnant women take iron and folic acid supplements, there is currently no national recommendation that pregnant women in China take iron or other vitamin or mineral supplements (other than folic acid).

 UNICEF is now testing a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement in programs to prevent low birth weight.

 Our study will provide additional information about the health impact of the UNICEF prenatal supplement versus an iron and folic acid supplement versus folic acid alone.

 Comparisons: - Infants of women who receive daily prenatal supplements that contain 4001/2g folic acid alone, will be compared with infants of women who receive daily supplements that contain 30 mg iron and 400 1/2g folic acid.

 - Infants of women who receive daily supplements that contain 30 mg iron and 400 1/2g folic acid will be compared with infants of women who receive a daily supplement containing 30 mg iron, 4001/2g folic acid and other vitamins and minerals (UNICEF formulation).

 Impact of Prenatal Vitamin/Mineral Supplements on Perinatal Mortality@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a daily prenatal supplement of iron plus folic acid or a daily prenatal supplement with multiple vitamins and minerals given to women from their first prenatal visit through delivery reduces perinatal mortality compared with a daily prenatal supplement of folic acid alone.
