(firstQuint)Effect of Polymorphisms in the IL-1 Gene Complex on the Development of Chronic Hepatitis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

 We analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes for interleukin-1a, interleukin-1b, interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, interleukin-1-receptor type I, and interleukin-1-receptor type II in 400 normal control and patients (chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma).

 Genotypes were tested for an association with development of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma by multivariable analysis.

 A second cohort of 1200 normal control and patients (chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma) was independently analyzed for the genotype associations identified in the first cohort.
