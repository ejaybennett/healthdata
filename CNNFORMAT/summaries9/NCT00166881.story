(fifthQuint)Weekly Docetaxel/Irinotecan for Non-resectable Gastric Cancers After Cisplatin Plus 5-FU/Leucovorin.

 1.

 To evaluate if weekly Docetaxel-Irinotecan,a potentially non-cross-resistant regimen,can prolong the overall survival (OS) or the duration of remission in those patients who have achieved CR or PR by P-HDFL regimen 2.

 To evaluate the efficacy of weekly Docetaxel-Irinotecan combination as salvage regimen for those patients who have either failed to achieve remission or have recurred from P-HDFL chemotherapy 3.

 To find out the optimal doses for docetaxel and irinotecan in a weekly dosing schedule for gastric cancer patients 4.

 To evaluate the toxicities of weekly Docetaxel-Irinotecan regimen in inoperable gastric cancers.

 Weekly Docetaxel/Irinotecan for Non-resectable Gastric Cancers After Cisplatin Plus 5-FU/Leucovorin@highlight

In this study, the investigators will use P-HDFL, a regimen with high tumor remission rate (~ 60-70%) and with only modest treatment-associated toxicities, as induction chemotherapy for patients with non-resectable gastric cancer.

 For those patients who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), DI will be used to "consolidate" the remission.

 For those patients who fail to achieve remission by P-HDFL, DI will be used as salvage chemotherapy.

 The efficacy and toxicities of DI in these two settings will be evaluated in this prospective study.
