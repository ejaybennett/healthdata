(secondQuint)Biopace Study: Biventricular Pacing for Atrioventricular Block to Prevent Cardiac Desynchronization.

 The study will be performed as a controlled, single-blind, international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel group design.

 In order to pragmatically examine the effectiveness of biventricular pacing in patients with an indication for ventricular pacing, the study group with biventricular pacing is compared to a control group with standard pacemakers which only allow univentricular (right ventricular) stimulation, as it has been the standard outside of clinical studies until so far.

The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate if patients with a standard indication for permanent ventricular pacing, left ventricular ejection fraction without limit, or any QRS duration will profit from the prevention of ventricular desynchronisation.
