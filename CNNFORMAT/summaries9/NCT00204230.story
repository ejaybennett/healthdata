(fifthQuint)MMF and Calcineurin Inhibitor Withdrawal in CAN.

 Prospective, randomised study: Effect of mycophenolatmofetil in patients with histologically proven chronic allograft nephropathy SYNOPSIS Indication: change in treatment to improve the course of chronic allograft nephropathy Method: open prospective, randomized two-tailed, non blinded monocentric study Follow up period: 35 Weeks Number of patients: 2 x 86 patients Inclusion criteria: cent Written informed consent - Reduction of graft function: Increase of serum creatinine >/= 0,1mg/dl/month in the previous 6 months before start of the study and/or new occurrence or increasing proteinuria in the last 6 months before start of the study - Serum creatinine 1 year after renal allografting - At least 5 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent dose Exclusion criteria: cent Malignomas - Gravidity or Lactation - Participation in other studies - Severe infections - Florid gastrointestinal Ulcer - Age between 18 and 70 years - Leukopenia with less that 3000/l leucocytes, Anaemia Hb 1/2 9 g/dl - Therapy with mycophenolatmofetil in the past 6 months - Acute rejections in the apst 6 months Study protocol: Phase I: Week 1.

-3.

 Conversion to Triple-Drug-Therapy, consisting of Mycophenolatmofetil, corticosteroids (e.

g.

 prednisolone) and ciclosporine A or Tacrolimus 1.

 Addition of Mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) to the previous immosuppressive treatment, consisting of ciclosporine A (CsA) or Tacrolimus (FK506) in combination with corticosteroids, e.

g.

 prednisolone (P).

 In the case that azathioprine (AZA) had been given, AZA is replaced by MMF.

 The therapy with MMF starts 3 days after the elimination of azathioprine.

 The addition of MMF follows the following scheme if nothing else is indicated: 1.

 week: 1g/day, 2.

week: 1,5g/day, 3.

week: 2g/day 2.

 Ciclosporine A bzw.

 tacrolimus: Target whole trough blood levels: CsA: 80-120 ng/ml (HPLC) FK506: 4-7 ng/ml (IMX Tacrolimus, Abbott) 3.

 Corticosteroids, e.

g.

 prednisolone: The previous dosage is continued, but at least 5 mg prednisolone/day (or equivalent) must be given Phase II: week 4.

-9.

 Randomisation at the beginning of week 4: All patients receiving at least 3 x 500 mg MMF per day were randomised as follows Group A: Continuation of the triple therapy Group B: Elimination of CsA bzw.

 FK506 The ciclosporine A- or tacrolimus-dosage is reduced ba 33% each 2 weeks so that after 6-8 weeks a total elimination of the drugs is reached.

 Phase III: week 10.

 Continuous therapy with.

: Group A: Triple therapy MMF / CsA bzw.

 FK506 / Corticosteroids e.

 Prednisolone Group B: Dual therapy MMF / Corticosteroids e.

 Prednisolone Primary Endpoint: Comparison of the development of 1/creatinine in both branches 32 weeks after randomization Secondary Endpoints: - Occurrence of.

 - acute rejections - infections - malignomas - gastrointestinal disorders - Blood pressure evolution and number of antihypertensive drugs - Changes concerning the lipid state - Changes concerning the glucose metabolism - Changes in metabolism of uric acid - Comparison of the development of 1/creatinine within each branch 6 months before and 6 months after therapy conversion - Comparison of drop out rate in branches A und B - Pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA) based on a new method of abbreviated area under the curve (AUC) determination - vessel wall changes of the carotid arteries measured by high resolultion ultrasound methods and hemodynamic parameters measured by task force equipment before and 9 month after cni withdrawal and MMF addition Criteria for study discontinuation: - Sepsis - Occurrence of acute rejections - Graft loss - Other severe adverse events - patients decision.
