(firstQuint)Racial Disparities in Pneumococcal Vaccination in Managed Care.

 Patients randomized to the intervention arm received a telephone call from managed care nurses asking about their pneumococcal vaccination status and whether they would like to be vaccinated.

 We compared six month follow-up of pneumococcal vaccination in electronic medical records for the intervention versus control group.

 We tested the percent vaccinated in each randomization arm using chi-square tests for proportions.
