 Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis.

 It is anticipated that a total of 200 patients will be entered into the study.

 The study population will consist of approximately 200 symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients with TASC C & D SFA lesions.

 The disease will consist of symptomatic, long de novo or restenotic lesions (> 70% stenosis) and occlusions (5 - 22 cm) on diagnostic imaging.

 The lesion must not extend into the distal SFA and the popliteal artery.

 At least one distal popliteal artery must be patent as well as one calf vessel.

 Reference vessel diameter must be >= 4.

 Patients will be followed for twelve months post-procedure.

 Study examinations will be done at screening, procedure time, discharge, six, and twelve months post procedure.

 This study will be conducted over up to 15 investigational sites in Germany.
