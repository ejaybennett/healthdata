(thirdQuint)A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Two Doses of Topiramate Compared to Placebo and Propranolol in the Prevention of Migraine.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of topiramate versus placebo and propranolol in the prevention of migraine headaches.

 The study consists of 4 phases: Baseline Phase (evaluation of eligibility criteria and tapering of any migraine prophylaxis medications patients are taking), Core Double-Blind Phase (patients are randomized to receive either 100 milligrams[mg]/day topiramate, 200mg/day topiramate, 160mg/day propranolol or placebo for a total of 26 weeks), Blinded Extension Phase (patients continue the same dose of medication until the sponsor terminates the study or a patient withdraws from the study), and Taper/Exit Phase (medication of patients exiting from the study is tapered over 7 weeks).

 The primary hypothesis is that one or two topiramate doses (100, 200 mg/day) will be superior to placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine based on the change in the monthly (28 days) migraine period rate from the prospective Baseline Phase to the Core Double-Blind Phase.

 Oral medication (100 milligrams[mg]/day topiramate, 200mg/day topiramate, 160mg/day propranolol, or placebo) during the 26-weeks Core Double-Blind Phase.

 Doses may be continued until the termination of the study or withdrawal by the patients during the Blinded Extension Phase.

 A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Two Doses of Topiramate Compared to Placebo and Propranolol in the Prevention of Migraine@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of topiramate (100 and 200 mg daily) versus placebo and propranolol in the prevention of migraine.

 The study will also assess dose response relationship of topiramate, estimate the relative efficacy of topiramate versus propranolol in prevention of migraine, and evaluate the effect of migraine prevention with topiramate versus placebo on Health Related Quality of Life.
