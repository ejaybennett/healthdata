(firstQuint)Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study of ISA247 in Plaque Psoriasis.

 Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can have a significant impact on patient's physical and mental well being.

 The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis.

 Targeted treatments in psoriasis have been reported recently, yet cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNi) remains one of the treatments which has the greatest efficacy.

 Voclosporin represents the possibility of a calcineurin inhibitor which is not only as efficacious as cyclosporine A, but also has an improved toxicity profile.

 Comparison(s): Voclosporin at 3 dose levels (0.

2, 0.

3, and 0.

4 mg/kg twice a day)compared to placebo.
