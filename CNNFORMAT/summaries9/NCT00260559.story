(thirdQuint)Outcomes After Esophagectomy With a Focus on Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy and Quality of Life.

 Assess short and long term outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy(MIE) compared to open esophagectomy.

 Measure standard observer derived outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, tumor recurrence and also patient derived outcomes, in particular quality of life (QOL) using the MOS SF36 questionnaire.

 Evaluate whether the SF36 will accurately reflect pre and postoperative changes in clinical status in this patient group.

Compare the results of this global QOL instrument (SF 36) to disease specific scales of dysphagia and reflux.

 Assess the impact of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy on QOL in this patient group and determine if any advantages of MIE can be demonstrated.
