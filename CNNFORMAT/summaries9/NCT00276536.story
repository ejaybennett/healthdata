(secondQuint)Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Stage IV Solid Tumors, Lymphoma, or Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: - Confirm tolerance and safety of interferon alfa-1b (IFN-1b) in patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.

 - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-1b given daily by subcutaneous injection in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

 Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously once daily for at least 1 month.

 Treatment continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of interferon alfa-1b until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
