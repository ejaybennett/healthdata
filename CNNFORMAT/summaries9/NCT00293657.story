(thirdQuint)Study of Lornoxicam or Placebo for Acute Treatment of the Headache of Migraine.

.

 The headache of migraine is the primary symptom of this disorder that is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the population of developed countries, with the majority of persons with migraine being females between the ages of 20 and 50 years.

 Patients with migraine desire rapid and complete relief from headache and decreased frequency of recurrence over the 24 hours after treatment.

 Current treatments for migraine often provide incomplete pain relief and additional acute treatments are needed.

 Lornoxicam is a member of the NSAID class of anti-inflammatory drugs and is shown to be effective in the acute management of postoperative pain and arthritis.

 The current study will evaluate the efficacy of single doses of lornoxicam, administered intravenously, in treatment of the headache of migraine to determine possible future uses of this drug in this condition.
