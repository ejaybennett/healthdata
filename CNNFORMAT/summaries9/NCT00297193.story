(thirdQuint)ASTIC Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Crohn's Disease.

 Open label, phase III, randomised, multicentre study comparing early transplantation procedure with transplantation carried out to the same protocol but delayed by one year.

 The status of patients undergoing early HSCT will be evaluated after one year and compared to those about to undergo delayed HSCT Patients will be randomised to: - Hematopoietic stem cell mobilisation followed, within 4 weeks, by high dose immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplantation - Hematopoietic stem cell mobilisation followed, after 59 weeks, by high dose immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation All patients will be mobilised prior to randomisation.

 Those receiving early transplantation will be compared over the first year with those whose transplant has been delayed.
