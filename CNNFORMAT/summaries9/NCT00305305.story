(fifthQuint)Brain Development Research Program.

 We are studying both the genetics and clinical features of these disorders.

 We hope to understand the problems faced by individuals with these disorders as well as their causes.

 In the future, we hope to develop therapies that are geared specifically for individuals based on the underlying biology.

 To participate in the study, you will be asked to provide a copy of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documenting Agenesis Corpus Callosum (ACC), Polymicrogyria (PMG), or Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), clinical information, and blood samples from the affected individual and from the parents.

 Please see contact information and our webpage below.

 Brain Development Research Program@highlight

Dr.

 Elliott Sherr and his collaborators at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) are studying the genetic causes of disorders of cognition and epilepsy, in particular disorders of brain development that affect the corpus callosum, such as Aicardi syndrome, as well as two additional brain malformations, polymicrogyria and Dandy-Walker malformation.

 The goal of the investigators' research is to use a better understanding of the underlying genetic causes as a foundation to develop better treatments for these groups of patients.
