(firstQuint)An Efficacy and Tolerability Study for Topiramate in Obese Patients With Binge Eating Disorder.

.

 This was a 21-week multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of an add-on treatment with 200mg of topiramate versus placebo in obese patients with BED receiving group CBT.

 The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive topiramate to CBT in obese patients with BED through improvement in binge eating, related psychopathology, and weight loss.

 The study hypothesis is that the patients using topiramate + CBT will loose more weight than patients using placebo + CBT.

Tolerability will be investigated through reported adverse events and dropouts, with reasons for leaving the study being analyzed.

 The randomized patients will receive capsules of topiramate (25 mg, 50 mg) or placebo correspondent daily for 21 weeks.
