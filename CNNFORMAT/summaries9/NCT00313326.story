(firstQuint)Comparative Study of Duration of Respiratory Weaning Between Adaptive Support Ventilation and Succession of Controlled Ventilation Then Spontaneous Ventilation for Patients After Surgery.

 General anaesthesia is marked by the passage of a stage of controlled ventilation where the patient does not carry out any respiratory work and the stage of spontaneous ventilation, which precedes extubation.

 Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a new protocol of weaning of the tracheal prosthesis after surgery which maintains a preset ventilation by an operator and the activity of the patient.

 At each breath, a microprocessor allows an optimization of volume and frequency by an adjustment of the inspiratory pressure and frequency.

 ASV was already validated for fast tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery.

 Our study proposes to compare the duration of intubation between this mode of weaning and with the traditional way (controlled ventilation then spontaneous ventilation) for faster surgery.

 The purpose of the study is to check the interest of ASV to limit the duration of intubation compared to the traditional protocol in this kind of intervention.
