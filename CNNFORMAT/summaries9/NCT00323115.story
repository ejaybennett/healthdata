(secondQuint)Phase II Feasibility Study of Dendritic Cell Vaccination for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

 Two to six weeks after surgery, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) will undergo a six-week course of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (temozolomide).

 Between three and seven weeks after completing radiotherapy/chemotherapy, patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells.

 These cells will be grown into dendritic cells, and cultured with tumor cells from the individual patient.

 Vaccinations will be given every two weeks for a total of three vaccinations.

 Four weeks after the third vaccination patients will resume chemotherapy for one year or until disease progression.

Adult patients who have surgical resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme will be treated with radiotherapy/chemotherapy followed by dendritic cell vaccine.

 Chemotherapy will be administered after three vaccinations for one year or until progression of disease.
