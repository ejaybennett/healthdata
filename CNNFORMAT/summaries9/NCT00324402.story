(secondQuint)Plasma Brain Natriuretic Peptide Levels in Pregnancy.

 The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful marker for volume overload, increased filling pressures and stretching of the myocardium.

 The current literature contains limited and unreliable information regarding normal BNP values in pregnancy.

 After baseline echocardiogram to detect individuals with asymptomatic structural defects, the participants will submit to 3 blood draws during the second and third trimester and at delivery to determine normal pregnancy values.

 Plasma Brain Natriuretic Peptide Levels in Pregnancy@highlight

To evaluate the maternal blood concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) during the second and third trimesters of a normal pregnancy.

 We will attempt to define a normal range for pregnancy and any outliers that may serve as markers for abnormal cardiovascular physiology.
