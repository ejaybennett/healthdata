(secondQuint)Gait Evaluation in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated With Glatiramer Acetate.

 Patients with a definite diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) will undergo a 3 dimensional gait analysis before initiation of treatment with glatiramer acetate.

 The gait analysis will include kinematic evaluation using a Charnwood Dynamics CODA CX-1 system, 4 AMTI force plates and a Noraxon telemetric EMG system.

 Patients will be videotaped and will also undergo a detailed physical examination by a physical therapist.

 Treatment with Glatiramer acetate will be initiated after the gait analysis.

 Therapy will be observed and controlled by a neurologist fromn the staff of the Multiple Sclerosis Center.

 Repeat gait analysis will be performed after one year of treatment.

 Gait Evaluation in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated With Glatiramer Acetate@highlight

Hypothesis: Treatment with Glatiramer acetate prevents deterioration of gait in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

 During the study patients will undergo a 3 dimensional gait analysis before starting treatment with glatiramer acetate and after 1 year of treatment.
