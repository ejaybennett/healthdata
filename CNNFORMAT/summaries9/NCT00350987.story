(thirdQuint)Procalcitonin Guided Antibiotic Therapy and Hospitalisation in Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: The "ProHOSP" Study.

 Background: Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), i.

e.

 acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), employ important hospital resources and often unnecessary antibiotic (AB) treatment courses.

 We demonstrated in four intervention trials enrolling > 1200 patients that procalcitonin (PCT)-guidance markedly reduces AB prescription and duration.

 To ascertain the external validity, safety and potential to improve the allocation of health care resources, a non-inferiority multicenter intervention trial has to be done.

 Aim: To compare a strategy based on evidence-based guidelines with PCT guided AB therapy in LRTI with respect to outcome (combined disease-specific failure rates), use of AB and hospital resources.

 Design: Investigator-initiated, controlled trial with an open intervention.

 Patients admitted with LRTI to hospital will be included and randomized 1:1 either to standard management or to the PCT-guided prescription of AB.

 Randomization will be stratified by centre (the hospital) and type of LRTI (Acute bronchitis/AECOPD/CAP).

 Setting: Teaching hospitals and tertiary care clinics from northwestern and central Switzerland.

 Patients: 18 years or older, with LRTI of > 1 and 0.

5 or > 0.

25 ug/L), respectively.

 A re-evaluation after 6 to 24 hours in patients in whom antibiotics are withheld with worsening or non-improvement of vital signs with PCT ( 0.

5 ug/L, 5 days; > 0.

25 ug/L, 3 days; one-sided to 1002.

 Interim monitoring: Regular review of serious adverse events, quality and integrity of the study by an independent data safety and monitoring board.

 Safety interim analysis and blinded assessment (i.

e.

, with both arms pooled) of the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of biomarkers after 50% of the patients recruited.

 Ancillary projects: Six related projects will be performed alongside to this study (including, cost-effectiveness, nursing and social influence on hospitalization, prognostic value of novel biomarkers) to synergize scientific efforts.

 Significance: Due to the high prevalence and absorption of hospital resources, this study will offer the potential for large improvements in the management of LRTIs, along with substantial reduction in hospitalization costs and AB resistance.

 Procalcitonin Guided Antibiotic Therapy and Hospitalisation in Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: The "ProHOSP" Study@highlight

The aim of this study is to test if procalcitonin (PCT) guided antibiotic stewardship in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) will be non-inferior, with at worst a 7.

5% higher combined failure rate, as compared to standard care practice (current guidelines for LRTI) with reduced total antibiotic (AB) use and hospitalization rate and duration, respectively.
