(firstQuint)Acupuncture for the Treatment of Phantom Limb and Residual Limb Pain After Amputation.

 The purpose of this pilot study is to identify the optimum combination of acupuncture points and treatment sequence in the treatment of post amputation limb pain in terms of the change in Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) and/or Residual Limb Pain (RLP) as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the McGill Short Form Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).

 Further, any side effects associated with the acupuncture treatment regimens, time requirements, and patient compliance with the treatment regimens will be estimated.

 Study participants will be randomized to one of three acupuncture treatments: Chinese Scalp Acupuncture, French Auricular Acupuncture, or a combination of both.
