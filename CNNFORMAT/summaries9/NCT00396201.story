(fifthQuint)AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Added to a Mobilizing Regimen of Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to Increase the Number of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs) in Patients With Hodgkin's Disease.

 Participants with HD who have been treated with cyto-reductive chemotherapy, who are to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation, and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to enter this study.

 The only changes to the standard of care is the addition of plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilization regimen on the day prior to apheresis and the collection of blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis by CD34+ fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.

 Blood samples for PK and CD34+ FACS analyses will be obtained prior to and after the first dose of plerixafor.

 Participants will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 mu g/kg daily) and will receive plerixafor (240 mu g/kg) on each day prior to apheresis.

 Participants will be apheresed for up to 5 consecutive days in order to collect the target number of CD34+ stem cells, (5*10^6 cells/kg).

 After apheresis, all participants will be treated with high dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation.

 Participants will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF plus plerixafor mobilization regimen.

 In the event that a sufficient number of cells for transplantation are not obtained from the collection, cells may be retained and pooled for transplantation at the investigator's discretion.

 The primary endpoint is the proportion of HD participants who collect 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg with this mobilization regimen.

 The secondary endpoints include the safety of this mobilization regimen, the proportion of participants who collect 2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, the change in CD34+ cells circulating in the peripheral blood after a dose of plerixafor, and the number of days of apheresis required to obtain 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg.

 In addition, success of the transplantation will be evaluated by measuring the time to engraftment of PMNs and PLTs.

 Participants will be followed for 12 months to assess transplant durability.

 AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Added to a Mobilizing Regimen of Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to Increase the Number of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs) in Patients With Hodgkin's Disease@highlight

Participants with Hodgkin's Disease (HD) who have been treated with cyto-reductive chemotherapy, who are to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation, and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to enter this efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study.

 The only changes to the standard of care is the addition of plerixafor to a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization regimen on each day prior to apheresis.

 The purpose of this protocol is to determine the proportion of participants who reach a target number of CD34+ stem cells (5*10^6 cells/kg) after hematopoietic stem cell mobilization with G-CSF and plerixafor.

 Safety and PK parameters are also collected.
