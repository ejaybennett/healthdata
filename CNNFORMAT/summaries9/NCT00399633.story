(secondQuint)Neuropeptides in the Humane Intra- og Extracerebral Circulation.

.

 The study is meant to give a better understanding of the basic mechanisms behind migraine, and a better understanding of the effects of sumatriptan on the trigemino vascular system.

 The endpoints are changes in the plasma values of the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) and the prostanoids 6-keto-PGF1, and PGE2, PGD2 og PGF2.
