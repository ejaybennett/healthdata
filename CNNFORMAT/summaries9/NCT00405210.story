(fifthQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of BAY43-9006 and Taxotere to Treat Patient With Prostatic Cancer.

 This study propose to treat patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory prostatic cancer in first intention.

 There is no limits of age from 18 years old.

 A new inhibitor of angiogenesis (Sorafenib) is associated to the standard treatment in this type of pathology.

 Patients have to demonstrate radiologically a disease progression and also a progression based on increase of psa level.

 The main objective is to Determine the recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 in combination with docetaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients as first line treatment in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

 Pharmacokinetic Study of BAY43-9006 and Taxotere to Treat Patient With Prostatic Cancer@highlight

The purpose of the trial is to determine the most effective dose of BAy 46-9003 associated to taxotere for first-line treatment of patient with prostatic cancer.

 BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and VEGFR inhibitor, which is orally available and has a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors.

 This, together with the antitumor activity observed after treatment with BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB), provides a rationale for further evaluation in patients with advanced cancer.

 The recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) for future studies is 400 mg bid as a continuous dosing schedule.
