(thirdQuint)Prospective Clinical Study of the Guidant Microwave Ablation System for the Treatment of PAF in the MIS Procedure.

 The study population for this study will be comprised of patients who have been diagnosed with symptomatic (PAF) for at least 6 months prior to study entry.

 Patients will be qualified for the study if they meet stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, signing an informed consent and agreeing to return for followup visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

 All study patients will receive microwave ablation to treat their symptomatic PAF.

 The Microwave Ablation System will be used during a MIS procedure on a beating heart in order to ablate a specified lesion pattern.
