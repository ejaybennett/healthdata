(thirdQuint)Does the Optic Disc Grading Done Visually by Your Doctor Agree With Optic Nerve Testing Which is Done by Machines?.

 The Disc Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS) has been shown to be a reproducible method for clinicians to evaluate the optic nerve for glaucomatous damage and is highly correlated to diagnosis of glaucoma, severity of glaucoma as evidenced by visual field loss and Heidelberg Retina Tomography (HRT) evaluation.

 In comparison with the commonly used cup-disc ratio, the DDLS has less inter-observer variation and captures glaucomatous aspects of the optic nerve not assessed by the cup-disc ratio.

 The optic nerve imagers do not have the potential to completely replace the clinical examination of the optic nerve since they do not assess many critical features such as optic nerve pallor, hemorrhages, asymmetry of disc size, edema, etc.

 The DDLS presents the opportunity to provide a system to clinicians to increase the quality and objectivity of clinical optic nerve evaluation.

 The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation of the DDLS grading to OCT, HRT and HVF testing of glaucomatous and normal optic nerves.

The purpose of this study is to determine how well the DDLS (Disc Damage Likelihood Scale) (which is a method used by the eye doctor to evaluate how healthy the optic nerve is) measures up to the standard glaucoma tests: OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography), the HRT (Heidelberg Retinal Tomography) and the HVF (Humphrey Visual Field).
