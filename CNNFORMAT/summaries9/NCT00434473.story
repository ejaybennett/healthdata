(thirdQuint)IMPACTS Trial: Investigation of the Modulation of Phospholipase in Acute Chest Syndrome.

 This is a double-blind randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose escalation study (2 cohorts) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) who are at-risk for development of acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the combination of VOC, fever (T 38.

0C), and a serum sPLA2 concentration 50 ng/mL.

 The first group of patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive low dose A-001 or placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.

 Pharmacokinetic and clinical data from this group will undergo review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).

 If there is no significant toxicity associated with A-001, then an additional group of patients will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to high dose A-001 versus placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.

The study will be conducted at 15-20 US centers in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion.

 Enrollees will be hospitalized sickle cell disease (SCD) patients at-risk for acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the presence of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), fever (T 38.

0C) and serum sPLA2 concentration 50 ng/mL.
