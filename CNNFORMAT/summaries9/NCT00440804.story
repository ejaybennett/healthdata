(firstQuint)Safety and Efficacy Study of Ibuprofen l-Lysine Solution in Premature Infants for Treatment of PDA.

 The ductus arteriosus remains patent in about 40% to 80% of very low birth weight infants.

 Early treatment by intravenous ibuprofen L-lysine (IV ibuprofen) has been suggested in preliminary studies to close the ductus and shorten hospital stay.

 This study aims to determine the effect of early treatment with IV ibuprofen given to the very low birth weight infant with a non-symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at less than 72 hours of life to accelerate and maintain ductal closure, thereby reducing the need for rescue therapy.
