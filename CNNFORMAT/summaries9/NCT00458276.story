(fifthQuint)Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Tezosentan in Patients With Pre-operative Pulmonary Hypertension, Due to Left Heart Disease, Undergoing Open Heart Surgery.

 Endothelin-1 levels are increased during and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and are associated with many deleterious consequences, including increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), reduced myocardial contractility, and ultimately right ventricular failure.

 Right ventricular failure during weaning from CPB increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with elevated PAP prior to cardiac surgery.

 Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been shown to decrease PVR and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and improve right ventricular function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

 In animal models, ERAs have been shown to decrease the incidence of post-bypass pulmonary hypertensive crises.

 The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that tezosentan, a dual ERA, reduces the incidence of clinically relevant right ventricular failure in patients with pre-operative pulmonary hypertension, due to left heart disease, undergoing CPB.

Endothelin-1 is a powerful substance that may be involved in causing hemodynamic instability (problems related to unstable blood pressure) during and after open heart surgery.

 Tezosentan is an investigational intravenous drug that blocks the endothelin receptors.

 This clinical trial will assess the potential benefit of tezosentan compared with placebo in the treatment of patients undergoing open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

 Treatment time is from the start of surgery up to 24 hours.
