(secondQuint)Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics of IV Diclofenac Sodium (2 Doses)Versus Oral Diclofenac Potassium.

 This study is an open-label, three-treatment, six sequence, three-period, single center crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous diclofenac sodium DIC075V (18.

75 mg and 37.

5 mg) versus oral diclofenac potassium (Cataflam(R) 50 mg) in healthy adult volunteers following single- and multiple-dose administration.

 Each treatment sequence received 1 dose every 6 hours (for a total of 4 doses per treatment sequence) with a 48-hour washout period between treatment sequences.
