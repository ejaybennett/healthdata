(fifthQuint)Melphalan, Prednisone, and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of melphalan and lenalidomide in combination with prednisone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

 - Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

 Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan and lenalidomide followed by a phase II study.

 - Phase I: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral prednisone daily on days 1-4.

 Patients also receive oral lenalidomide daily on days 1-21.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan and lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

 * Phase II: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral lenalidomide as in phase I at the MTD.

 Patients also receive oral prednisone as in phase I.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

 Melphalan, Prednisone, and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma@highlight

RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

 Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan and lenalidomide when given together with prednisone and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
