(fifthQuint)Data Collection for Patients With Low Grade Ovarian Carcinoma.

 Low-grade tumors of female organs are considered rare.

 Because of this, doctors do not know the best treatment for these kinds of tumors.

 Researchers want to learn more about patients' experience with these types of cancer to help find ways to develop better therapies to treat them.

 If you agree to take part in this study, information about your type of cancer, the type of treatment you had or are having, and details about your follow-up care will be entered into a research database.

 These data will be collected from patients seen at MD Anderson since January, 1950.

 This information will serve as a basis for research studies about patients with low-grade ovarian tumors.

 Your data will mostly come from your MD Anderson medical record.

 However, information may also be requested from you, your local doctor, or an outside hospital.

 Information collected from sources other than MD Anderson will be included in your MD Anderson medical record as well as entered into this study's database.

 Information may be directly collected from you, if there are additional questions not provided in your medical records, if your information is not complete, or if your information collected from other sources does not match what is in your MD Anderson medical record.

 To help ensure confidentiality, the database will be password-protected with access strictly limited to study staff.

 This research database will be updated at least once a year to include information about your current treatment and/or follow-up care.

 This information is usually collected from your MD Anderson medical record, or it may be necessary to contact you directly.

 This information will be collected indefinitely.

 If you wish to end your participation in this study, you may request that your data remain in the database or that your information be deleted from the database.

 This is an investigational study.

 Up to 2000 patients from MD Anderson will take part in this study.
