(fifthQuint)Prevention of Catheter-Associated Infection With the Skin Disinfectant Octenidine Dihydrochloride.

 Catheter-associated infections are one of the most eminent healthcare acquired infections.

 More than 40% of all bloodstream infections are associated with a central venous catheter (CVC)and between 1% and 5% of the affected patients die as a direct consequence of this infection.

 The most important microorganisms are gram-positive cocci (S.

 aureus, S.

 epidermidis).

 In intensive care units gram-negative microorganisms such as pseudomonas, acinetobacter and candida spp.

 are more frequent.

 The insertion site is the main source of contamination and infection in short-term CVCs (10-14 days.

 In this case the infection is caused by migration of microorganisms along the outside of the catheter.

 Contamination of the hub due to frequent manipulation is usually the source of infection in long-term CVCs.

 In this case the infection occurs intraluminally.

 An effective skin disinfection is the main measure of prevention before insertion of a CVC.

 The aim of this measure is the elimination of transient and the reduction of resident microorganisms around the insertion site.

 To achieve this, disinfectants on the basis of alcohol, povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine are applied.

 Alcohol-based disinfectants are preferred in Central Europe because of their rapid initial effect and broad microbiological spectrum.

 Chlorhexidine and povidone-Iodine in contrast to alcoholic disinfectants have a remanent effect which reduces regrowth of microorganisms beyond the immediate initial effect.

 To which extent remanent substances reduce colonization of the CVC extraluminally or the CVC-tip is still being disputed.

 In an earlier clinical trial a residual or remanent effect of 0.

1% octenidine combined with propanol in microbial skin decontamination over a 24h period was shown in neurosurgical patients receiving a central line (CVC or peripherally inserted central catheter).

 The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate further the preventive impact and tolerability of a commercially available, alcohol-based antiseptic solution containing octenidine for the preparation and care of CVC insertion sites in a clinical setting in comparison with the results given by an alcoholic solution alone.

 Prevention of Catheter-Associated Infection With the Skin Disinfectant Octenidine Dihydrochloride@highlight

Health-care-acquired infections are of tremendous importance for patients, especially catheter-associated infections.

 More than 40% of all bloodstream infections are associated with central venous catheters (CVC; catheters which are inserted into a large vein near the heart).

 Of all patients that acquire such an infection 1% to 5% die as a result from it.

 The insertion site is the main source of contamination and infection.

 In general, bacteria of the skin are the cause of infection, especially in short-term CVCs (10-14 days).

 Therefore it is necessary to efficiently disinfect the skin for the preparation and care of CVC insertion sites.

 Several substances are used for disinfection.

 Alcohol-based disinfectants are mainly used in Central Europe, other preparations contain povidine-iodine or chlorhexidine.

 Alcoholic disinfectants have a rapid initial effect, chlorhexidine shows an additional remanent (longer lasting) effect.

 A further substance, octenidine dihydrochloride, also demonstrated a remanent effect in a pilot study with neurosurgical patients.

 The purpose of our study is to compare an alcohol-based disinfectant containing octenidine dihydrochloride with a pure alcoholic disinfectant regarding efficacy and tolerability in patients receiving a CVC for a minimum of 5 days.
