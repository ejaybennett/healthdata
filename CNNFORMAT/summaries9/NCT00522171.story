(secondQuint)Harmonic Versus Electro Surgery in Lower Body Lift Procedures.

 Lower Body Lift procedures are performed to correct skin redundancy and muscle diastases caused by significant weight loss, poor skin tone, etc.

 Lower Body Lift procedures involve a high risk of early complications, including hematomas, seromas, necrosis, and wound-healing problems.

 The occurrence of these complications may be due in part to the extensive undermining and division of the superficial and the deep arterial systems, done in conventional procedures.

 Persistent serous wound drainage and seromas are the most common complications in Lower Body Lift procedures.

 The rate of serous fluid collection determines the time drains need to remain in place.

 Although suction drains reduce seroma formation, prolonged use can delay healing, cause injury, and increase the risk of retrograde infection and patient discomfort.

 Wound drainage has a direct correlation with seroma formation.

 The loss of protein nutrients and minerals in the serum drained is also a concern with prolonged drainage that can result in healing delays.

 The Harmonic cent technology uses ultrasonic energy that allows both cutting and coagulating at the precise point of application.

 The Harmonic cent has been used since 1992 predominantly in urology and gastro-intestinal surgery (laparoscopic surgery).

 Significantly reduced serous drainage in a number of general surgery procedures such as superficial and total parotidectomy; thyroidectomy; tonsillectomy; pectoralis major myocutaneous flap dissection; axillary dissection; and lymphadenectomy have been reported with the use of Harmonic cent .

 The Harmonic cent has also been used in parotidectomy and maxillofacial surgery, but its use has been seldom mentioned in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery.

 Recent use of the Harmonic cent has shown promise in plastic and reconstructive surgery in dissection of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and total body lifts.

 Harmonic Versus Electro Surgery in Lower Body Lift Procedures@highlight

The objective of this study is to determine if the use of The Harmonic cent (an ultrasonic surgical instrument) in Lower Body Lift procedures reduces volume and duration of wound drainage after surgery when compared to Electro Surgery.
