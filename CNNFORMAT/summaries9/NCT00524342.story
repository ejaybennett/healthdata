(fifthQuint)IL-11 in Women With Von Willebrand Disease and Refractory Menorrhagia.

 This study is a prospective, single-center Phase II trial of Neumega (rhIL-11) in women with type 1 VWD and menorrhagia refractory to estrogen, hormones, or hemostatic agents.

 It is anticipated that 10 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will enroll and complete this study.

 All aspects of this study, including the rhIL-11 injections and the screening, hemostatic and safety monitoring, and coagulation testing, are considered experimental.

 The specific objectives are to determine the efficacy and safety of rhIL-11 in reducing menstrual blood loss in adult women with type 1 VWD during six consecutive menstrual cycles, and to determine the mechanism of the hemostatic response of rhIL-11.
