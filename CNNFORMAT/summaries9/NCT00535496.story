(fifthQuint)Relation Between TOF-Watch SX and a Peripheral Nerve Stimulator After 4.

0 mg.

Kg-1 Sugammadex (P05698).

 The TOF-Watch(R) SX has been used for neuromuscular monitoring in all clinical trials with sugammadex.

 In clinical practice however, a PNS is commonly used in many hospitals worldwide.

 A disadvantage of a PNS is that it is not objective monitoring like the TOF-Watch(R) SX, and it can detect only the number of twitches.

 In this trial, the relationship between the time to reappearance of T4 using PNS (i.

e.

 Ministim(R) model MS-IV) and the time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.

9 using the TOF-Watch(R) SX was determined after a dose of 4.

0 mg/kg sugammadex was administered 15 minutes after the last dose of rocuronium.

 Determining this relationship will enable the provision of advice on when it is safe to extubate participants after administration of 4.

0 mg/kg sugammadex for reversing neuromuscular block while using a PNS.

 The time to reappearance of T4 was assessed by a blinded PNS-assessor.

 This assessor was blinded for the dose of sugammadex used and for the TOF results measured with the TOF-Watch(R) SX.

Kg-1 Sugammadex (P05698)@highlight

The objective of the trial is to determine the relationship within a participant between the time to manual detection of the reappearance of the fourth twitch (T4) measured using a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) and the time to recovery of the fourth twitch/first twitch (T4/T1) ratio to 0.

9 measured using a Train Of Four (TOF)-Watch(R) SX, of 4.

0 mg/kg sugammadex administered at 15 minutes after either a bolus dose of 0.

6 mg/kg rocuronium or the last maintenance dose of 0.

15 mg/kg rocuronium.
