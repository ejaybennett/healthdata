(fifthQuint)Erlotinib and SBRT in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the effect of erlotinib and stereotactic body radiotherapy on 6-month progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 Secondary - To describe the actuarial rate of in-field local control and out-of-field disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

 - To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

 - To evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

 - To evaluate the duration of erlotinib usage and time to initiation of third-line systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biologic agent) in these patients.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Beginning 1-4 weeks after the initiation of erlotinib hydrochloride, patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

 Giving erlotinib together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib together with stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
