(fifthQuint)Carboplatin, Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM).

 This was a planned Phase I/II dose escalation study.

 Patients were enrolled in a cohort of 3.

 Eligible patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma received frontline treatment consisting of carboplatin AUC 5, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 every 21 days (Tier-1).

 Dose escalation continued to achieve a target dosage using carboplatin AUC 6 (Tier-2).

 After a maximum of 6 treatment cycles, non-progressing patients received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and pemetrexed every 21 days to complete 1-year total treatment duration.

The purpose of this research study was to evaluate how effective the combination of Carboplatin, Bevacizumab (Avastin cent ) and, Pemetrexed (Alimta cent ) is in the treatment of patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM).

 A combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed is considered standard for this disease and typically off protocol patients would receive cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed as standard of care.

 The planned length of the study (first patient screened to last patient enrolled) was 24 months.

 The planned length of the entire study (enrollment period + the treatment period + a follow-up period of at least 12 months) was 36 months.
