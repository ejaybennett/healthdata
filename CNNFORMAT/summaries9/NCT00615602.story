(secondQuint)Six vs 12 Months of Trastuzumab With Docetaxel Following FEC as Adjuvant Treatment in N+ Breast Cancer.

 Anthracycline-containing regimens are recommended as adjuvant treatment for women with node positive breast cancer.

 In at least three large randomized clinical trials the addition or sequential administration of a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an antracycline-based regimen resulted in superior clinical outcome for women with node positive early breast cancer.

 In two large randomized studies the dose dense administration with G-CSF support of anthracycline-based and paclitaxel combination was superior to the same regimen administered every three weeks without growth factors as adjuvant therapy in women with axillary node positive breast cancer.

 In one randomized trial, docetaxel was proved superior to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer.

 Trastuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) in combination with paclitaxel was superior to paclitaxel alone in women with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2.
