(thirdQuint)Strategies to Reduce Antipsychotic-Associated Weight Gain in Youth.

 This is a 24 week, placebo-controlled, random assignment pilot study in which participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexible-dose treatment with metformin for 6 months as well as a newly initiated second generation antipsychotic medication or to receive placebo and the newly initiated antipsychotic medication.

 All subjects will also be provided healthy lifestyle instruction.

 The study involves monthly visits for the duration of the study.

 Participants may be treated as inpatients or outpatients throughout the course of the study.

 Participants will receive a psychiatric evaluation, physical exam, lab work, ECG, medication treatment, and psychiatric care.

 The goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of means to prevent and treat weight gain and the associated endocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory changes caused by antipsychotic medications.

 Behavioral treatments to reduce weight gain and metabolic problems after weight gain has occurred have had little impact.

 Such interventions must be intensive and sustained over months, if not years to be effective.

 Although basic lifestyle instruction (diet and physical activity) should be the standard of care for all children and adolescents at risk for becoming overweight, pharmacologic interventions may be the best option for substantially augmenting behavioral approaches to weight management.

The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether starting metformin in conjunction with a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) and providing information about healthy eating and activity will prevent or reduce the amount of weight gain and the metabolic changes in adolescent youth typically seen with second-generation antipsychotic medication.
