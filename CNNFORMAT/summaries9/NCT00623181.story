(secondQuint)Study to Determine a Preference for Fluzone Vaccine Given Intradermally (ID) and Intramuscularly (IM) in Healthy Adults.

 The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine, in a relatively small sample of persons 18-49 years of age, if there is a preference trend for a particular route of administration, ID vs IM, when receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine.

 Uptake of influenza vaccine is disappointingly low in this age group, and there is the perception that aversion to IM injection plays a role in vaccination avoidance.

 The BD Micro-Injection System to be used in this study may offer a more acceptable alternative to the standard IM injection for influenza immunization and thereby promote wider acceptance of influenza vaccination.
