(secondQuint)A One Year Open Label Study Assessing the Safety and Tolerability of Vilazodone in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

 Patients will be enrolled at approximately 40 US investigative sites and receive vilazodone for 52 weeks of open label treatment.

 Safety measurements will include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory, ophthalmologic exams, Changes in Sexual Function Questionnaire (CSFQ) scale and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings collected over the course of the treatment period.

 Effectiveness measurements will be done at baseline and each visit until week 52 or end-of-treatment.

 A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be collected for genetic analysis related to response to vilazodone.
