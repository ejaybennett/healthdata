(firstQuint)A-Part Gel as Adhesion Prophylaxis After Major Abdominal Surgery Versus a Non-treated Group.

 Primary Objective: cent first assessment of the safety of applying A-Part(R) Gel as adhesion prophylaxis after major abdominal surgery by specific observation of two major complications of abdominal surgery (wound healing impairment, and/or postoperative peritonitis) in comparison to a control group.

 Secondary Objectives: - To further evaluate the safety of A-Part(R) Gel by comparing the incidences of adverse events between the treatment groups (with special attention to anastomosis leakage) - To explore the efficacy of A-Part(R) Gel in reducing post-surgical adhesions after median laparotomy.
