(fifthQuint)Phase I Study of CDX-1307, hCG-B Vaccine, for Patients With Incurable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast, Colorectal, Pancreatic, Bladder or Ovarian Cancer.

 Protocol CDX1307-02: CDX-1307 is an investigational drug that is being tested to see if it can stimulate the immune system (the cells and substances that protect the body from infection and foreign matter) of people with certain kinds of cancer.

 It is believed that the body's immune system can attack tumor cells and kill them.

 It is thought that immune cells recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to fight the cancer.

 One of these proteins is called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-) and is found on several types of cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian.

 The study drug, CDX-1307, is given as an intravenous infusion (administered in a vein in the arm or through a port-a-catheter).

 In addition, the study includes combination therapies which are thought to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells.

 Phase I Study of CDX-1307, hCG-B Vaccine, for Patients With Incurable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast, Colorectal, Pancreatic, Bladder or Ovarian Cancer@highlight

This research study is for individuals who have advanced breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian or bladder cancer.

 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

 is testing a form of immune therapy (vaccine) to see if it can be used to make the immune system attack the cancer.

 The study includes administration of additional treatments, in combination, thought to enhance the immune response effect.

 This study specifically administers the vaccine systemically to explore whether dendritic cell targeted vaccines can generate more robust effects via intravenous injection.
