(thirdQuint)A Phase 1b Study With Volociximab in Combination With Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab in First-line, Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

 Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of volociximab in combination with C/P + B in subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC.

 Subjects will be treated with the C/P + B + volociximab (V)combination for a total of 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle).

 Subjects with stable disease (SD)or better per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)after the 6th cycle of combination treatment (C/P + B + V) will be considered for further treatment in a maintenance phase with B + V at the same dose until subject withdrawal from treatment.

 Volociximab will be administered at doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

 Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab will be administered at their registered doses for this combination.

 Follow up for each subject will extend over a 90-day period following the last dose of volociximab.

 End of study is defined as 90 days after the last dose of volociximab for the last subject treated in the study.
