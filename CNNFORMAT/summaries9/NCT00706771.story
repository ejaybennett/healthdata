(thirdQuint)Bicarbonate and Lipocalin in Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Study.

 The investigators hypothesise: 1.

 In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level is feasible.

 2.

 In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level is safe.

 3.

 In patients with SIRS and oliguria the early administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride (control) triggered by an abnormally high NGAL level leads to signs or trends of efficacy as measured by serum creatinine derived indices.

 Bicarbonate and Lipocalin in Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Study@highlight

The investigators will determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in reducing progression to overt acute renal failure in patients with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and low urine output or early acute renal impairment as defined by serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).
