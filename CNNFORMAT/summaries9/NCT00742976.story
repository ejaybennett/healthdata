(thirdQuint)Effects of Insulin Detemir and NPH Insulin on Renal Handling of Sodium, Fluid Retention, and Weight in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.

 Type 2 diabetic patients experience weight gain when receiving insulin treatment.

 There has been reports that the weight gain is less or absent when patients are treated with Insulin Detemir.

 Patients with diabetes have increased total body sodium and increased extracellular volume.

 We hypothesize that part of the weight gain seen is due to increase in extracellular volume and that the lesser weight gain seen in patients treated with Detemir is due to an lesser increase in extracellular volume.

 We believe that the cause of this difference is the different pharmacokinetic properties of insulin Detemir.

 Insulin Detemir i protein bound and is therefore not excreted in the kidneys.

 This may cause less sodium reabsorption, than with other insulins, and therefore less increase in extracellular volume.

 We test this hypothesis by examining urinary sodium excretion, extracellular volume by GFR measurements, Body composition by DEXA scan, body weight, and 24 hour blood pressure.

In patients that are changed from Insulin Insulatard to Insulin Detemir and back.

 Effects of Insulin Detemir and NPH Insulin on Renal Handling of Sodium, Fluid Retention, and Weight in Type 2 Diabetic Patients@highlight

Hypothesis: Changing type 2 patients treatment from Insulin Insulatard to Insulin Detemir will increase their excretion of sodium in the urine and thereby decrease their extracellular volume and body weight.

 24 patients are divided into 2 groups and their insulin treatment is shifted while their body composition, sodium excretion, weight and extracellular volume is monitored.
