(thirdQuint)Photodynamic Therapy Using Aminolevulinic Acid in Treating Patients With Skin Cancer.

 OBJECTIVES: - To determine the safety and efficacy of intralesional photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid and non-coherent blue light in patients with nodular basal cell carcinoma.

 OUTLINE: Patients undergo photodynamic therapy comprising intralesional injection of aminolevulinic acid followed by non-coherent blue light therapy over approximately 17 minutes.

 Patients may undergo re-treatment with photodynamic therapy 8 weeks later.

 Patients undergo photographic assessment of their skin lesions at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and then at 1 and 2 years to evaluate healing time, clinical improvement, and side effects.

 Patients undergo biopsies of their skin lesions at 16 weeks and then at 1 and 2 years to confirm histological clearance.

 Photodynamic Therapy Using Aminolevulinic Acid in Treating Patients With Skin Cancer@highlight

RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light.

 When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed.

 This may be an effective treatment against skin cancer.

 PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid and to see how well it works in treating patients with skin cancer.
