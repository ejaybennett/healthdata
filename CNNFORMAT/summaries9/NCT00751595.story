(fifthQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of the HIV-1 Tat Vaccine.

 This phase II clinical trial was directed at evaluating the immunogenicity and the safety of the HIV-1 Tat protein-based vaccine.

 Anti-Tat antibody negative, HIV-1 positive subjects treated successfully with HAART have been screened and recruited for a 48-weeks study, including a period of 16 or 8 weeks treatment phase and a period of 32 or 40 weeks follow-up phase, in arm A or Arm B, respectively.

 One hundred sixty-eight subjects have been randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of the 2 arms (Arm A and Arm B) and each arm has been divided in the following groups: Arm A - Group I: 5 immunizations with Tat (7.

5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm A - Group II: 5 immunizations with Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm B - Group I: 3 immunizations with Tat (7.

5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8; Arm B - Group II: 3 immunizations with Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8.

 Four vaccination regimens have been tested by intradermal administration of the Tat vaccine at two different doses (7.

5 microg or 30 microg) in 5 or 3 immunizations.

 Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of the HIV-1 Tat Vaccine@highlight

The study is a randomized, open label, phase II clinical trial directed at evaluating the immunogenicity (as a primary end-point) and the safety (as a secondary end-point), of the recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine in HIV-1 infected adult subjects, anti-Tat antibody negative, HAART-treated with chronic suppressed HIV-1 infection, CD4+ T cell counts >= 200 cells/microliter, levels of plasma viremia < 50 copies/ml in the last 6 months prior to the screening and without a history of virologic rebound.

 The immunogenicity of 3 or 5 immunizations of the two different vaccine doses (7.

5 and 30 micrograms) of the Tat vaccine has been evaluated.
