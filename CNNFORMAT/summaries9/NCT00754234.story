(secondQuint)Iron Bioavailability From MyPyramid Menus.

 Nonheme iron absorption is measured with 59Fe tracer added to a 1-day menu, with iron retention detected two weeks later in a whole body scintillation counter.

 Each subject has iron absorption measured from each of 7 1-d menus formulated to meet the US dietary guidelines (MyPyramid menus), with the order of menus randomly assigned.

 Each subject participates for 14 wk to test all 7 menus.

 Iron Bioavailability From MyPyramid Menus@highlight

This study will measure nonheme iron absorption from each of the 7 daily MyPyramid menus.

 Such measurements will confirm whether modifications are needed to meet dietary iron recommendations and will provide data useful for validation algorithms to calculate dietary iron bioavailability.
