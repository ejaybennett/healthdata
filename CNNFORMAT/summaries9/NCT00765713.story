(fifthQuint)Sleep Apnea-hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) and Ventricular Arrhythmias.

 Secondary objectives: To compare the prevalence of SAHS in patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left ventricle dysfunction with ICD with that of the general population.

 To study the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia) and inappropriate defibrillator therapies in these patients.

 To value the effect of the treatment with CPAP on the above mentioned arrhythmias.

 To relate the effect of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias with sleep parameters, cardiovascular biomarkers, inflammation and oxidative stress.

 To evaluate the long-term effect of the CPAP on systemic biomarkers in patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left ventricle dysfunction.

 To evaluate the long-term effect of CPAP on the quality of life in these patients.

 Sample size: 224 patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left ventricle dysfunction with ICD will be included to randomize 19 SAHS subjects for arm.

 Sleep Apnea-hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) and Ventricular Arrhythmias@highlight

Hypothesis: The CPAP treatment diminishes the effect of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy, systolic ventricular disfunction and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS)Objectives: To analyze the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (premature ventricular beat, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and sustained ventricular tachycardia) and appropriate defibrillator therapies in patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy, moderate-severe left ventricular dysfunction,with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and sleep apnea.

 To study the effect of CPAP on the cardiac arrhythmias and on the number of appropriate defibrillator therapies.

 Design: Parallel, randomized and single-blinded multicentric study to compare CPAP vs.

 hygienic-dietetic recommendations.

 Patients with SAHS (AHI15) and systolic left ventricle dysfunction patients with an ICD.

 Duration: 24 months.
