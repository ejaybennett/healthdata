(thirdQuint)Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Study of EVP-6124 in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.

 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1b safety study of three dose levels of EVP-6124 in subjects with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease and who are taking an AChEI medication (donepezil or rivastigmine).

 Study drug will be supplied as capsules and will be orally administered once daily for a total of 28 days.

 Eligible subjects will be admitted to an inpatient study unit on Day -2 (two days before the first dose of study drug is administered) and will remain confined to the inpatient study unit for a total of five days.

 Starting on Day 4, subjects will continue the study in the outpatient setting, with study visits on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28.

 Safety assessments, PK sampling, and cognitive testing will be performed inpatient and at each study visit.

 Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Study of EVP-6124 in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease@highlight

This study is being conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three different doses of an investigational medication, EVP-6124, in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who are also taking an Alzheimer's medication (AChEI [acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]: either donepezil or rivastigmine).

 In addition, PK of AChEI medications will be assessed.

 Cognitive function will be evaluated on an exploratory basis.
