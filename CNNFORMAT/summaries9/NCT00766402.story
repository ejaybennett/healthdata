(thirdQuint)An Efficacy and Safety Study of Tramadol/Acetaminophen Versus Diclofenac in the Treatment of Pain in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis Receiving Stable Treatment of Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).

 This is a single center, open labeled (all people know the identity of intervention), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), parallel group (a medical research study comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different interventions (treatments) trial to compare the effectiveness (pain relief) and safety of tramadol 37.

5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg with diclofenac in participants with ankylosing spondylitis receiving stable treatment of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

 Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups (tramadol/acetaminophen and Diclofenac).

 One group will be treated with tramadol 37.

5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablet and another group will be treated with diclofenac 50 mg tablet.

 Participants randomized into this study will be instructed to take one tablet Ultracet or diclofenac 50 mg orally, twice a day for 8 weeks.

 Evaluations will be performed as outlined: at Screening, at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8.

 The primary efficacy parameter is to compare the mean change from Baseline in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score between the two treatment groups (tramadol/acetaminophen versus diclofenac).

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 An Efficacy and Safety Study of Tramadol/Acetaminophen Versus Diclofenac in the Treatment of Pain in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis Receiving Stable Treatment of Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)@highlight

The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical benefit of tramadol/acetaminophen versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (diclofenac 50 milligram [mg]) in the treatment of pain in participants with ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine causing pain and stiffness) receiving stable treatment of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
