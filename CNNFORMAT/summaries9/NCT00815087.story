(firstQuint)Functional Electrical Stimulation in Irradiated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).

 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients usually underwent radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy(CRT).

 There were some complications caused by RT, like dysphagia.

 In recent studies, functional electrical stimulation (FES) was be used in neurologically dysphagia patients, and there were some positive effects with these studies.

 Hence, we decided applied FES to these NPC patients with dysphagia.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether functional electrical stimulation is effective in the treatment of dysphagia due to nasopharyngeal cancer post radiotherapy
