(firstQuint)Effects of the Ivabradine on Reduction of Inflammatory Markers in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome.

 The activation of inflammatory pathways plays an important contributory role in coronary plaque instability and subsequent rupture, which can lead to the development of acute coronary syndromes.

 Elevated levels of serum inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) represent independent risk factors for further cardiovascular events.

 Raised resting heart rate (HR) has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular events.

 Ivabradine is a new HR-reducing agent, which has demonstrated antianginal and anti-ischemic properties in patients with stable angina.

 In an atherosclerosis model, selective HR reduction with ivabradine has been shown to decrease markers of vascular oxidative stress, to improve endothelial function, and to reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation.

 We hypothesized that the addition of ivabradine to standard medical therapy has a beneficial effect on markers of inflammatory stress in acute coronary syndrome patients.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a pure heart rate-lowering agent (Ivabradine) reduces vascular inflammatory stress in patients with acute coronary syndromes
