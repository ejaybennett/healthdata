(thirdQuint)Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Sexual and Injection Risks Among Female Sex Workers Who Also Inject Drugs in Mexico.

 Our specific aims are: - Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to decrease sharing of syringes and injection paraphernalia among FSW-IDUs.

 We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the active experimental injection risk reduction condition will report: (a) less receptive and distributive needle sharing; (b) less sharing of injection paraphernalia; (c) obtaining syringes and injection paraphernalia from safer sources.

 - Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to increase condom use among FSW-IDUs in the context of ongoing drug use.

 We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the active experimental sexual risk reduction condition will: (a) report less unprotected vaginal and anal sex; and (b) have fewer incident cases of specific STIs.

 - Aim 3: To evaluate the joint effects of these two behavioral interventions to increase condom use and reduce sharing of needles and syringes/injection paraphernalia among FSW-IDUs.

 We hypothesize that the joint effect of these interventions will generate greater risk reductions compared to either intervention alone.

 - Aim 4: To determine the extent to which theoretically-important components of our interventions (i.

e.

, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attitudes, intentions) represent underlying mechanisms of change in primary outcomes (i.

e.

, sexual- and injection-related risk reductions).

 - Aim 5: To explore subgroup differences in the efficacy of: a) the sexual risk reduction, and b) the injection risk reduction intervention based on background characteristics, contextual factors, social factors and intrapersonal factors.

 Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Sexual and Injection Risks Among Female Sex Workers Who Also Inject Drugs in Mexico@highlight

The investigators propose a highly efficient four-arm (factorial) trial to simultaneously test the efficacy of two behavioral interventions aimed at: - increasing condom use in the context of ongoing drug use and - decreasing needle and paraphernalia sharing among female sex workers who also inject drugs in two Mexican-U.
