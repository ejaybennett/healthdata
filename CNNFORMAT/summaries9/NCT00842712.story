 Once weekly safety lab evaluation during safety run-in (after end of chemotherapy): safety laboratory assessments (hematology including coagulation parameters and biochemistry).

 6-weekly Evaluation Visit (Every 6 weeks +/- 2 days after randomization until final tumor assessment (FTA) visit): Physical examination including vital signs (without BSA/weight); assessment of cardiovascular specific symptoms; documentation of AEs; concomitant medication; ECOG-performance status; central standard ECG after cycle 6 only; CT scan or MRI; safety laboratory assessments (hematology including coagulation parameters and biochemistry); serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

 Blood sampling for plasma circulating markers during maintenance treatment only, and for CTC/CEC (only once after 6 cycles of chemotherapy).

 Final Tumor Assessment Visit (At occurrence of PD and/or before start of any other systemic anti-tumor therapy): Physical examination including vital signs (without BSA); documentation of AEs; concomitant medication; ECOG-performance status; CT scan or MRI; safety laboratory assessments (hematology including coagulation parameters and biochemistry); blood sampling for plasma circulating markers and CTC/CEC; serum pregnancy test.

 End-of-Study (EoS) Visit (Around 28 days after the last investigational medicinal product [cilengitide or cetuximab] administration, or before other anticancer treatment starts, but not before the FTA visit): Physical examination including vital signs (without BSA); documentation of AEs.

 If a subject begins a subsequent anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs will end at the time the new treatment starts; ECOG-performance status; concomitant medication; safety laboratory assessments (hematology including coagulation parameters and biochemistry); blood sampling for HACA assessment; central 12-lead ECG; reason for discontinuation.

 Survival Follow-up (Every 2 months after EoS visit): Each subject's survival status and any further anti-cancer treatments will be documented every 2 months after the end of study visit until death, loss to follow-up, or consent withdrawal.

 All subjects will be treated with platinum-based chemotherapy for a maximum of 6 cycles (that is, 18 weeks), until PD or death, unacceptable toxicity, or until the subject withdraws consent.

 Subjects who do not experience PD after 6 cycles of platinum-based treatment will continue treatment with cilengitide (Groups A and B) and cetuximab (Group A, B and C).

 Subjects who discontinue treatment without PD will remain on study.

 Response assessment will continue every 6 weeks until PD or until other anti-tumor treatment is started.

 Upon this occurrence, all study medication should be discontinued and a final tumor assessment (FTA) visit will be carried out.

 The end-of-study visit should be performed around 4 weeks after the last investigational medicinal product administration but not before the FTA visit.

 Cilengitide and Cetuximab in Combination With Platinum-based Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for Subjects With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)@highlight

Primary objective of the study's Safety run-in: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cilengitide in combination with cetuximab, and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine or cisplatin/gemcitabine).

 Primary objective of the study's Randomization Part: - To assess the efficacy of cilengitide in combination with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine or cisplatin/gemcitabine) compared to cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy alone in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) time.

 Study design and plan: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled Phase II study with a safety run-in part in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 During the safety run-in, the regimen was intensified stepwise by cohort (cilengitide intravenous [i.

v.

] 1000 milligram [mg] to 2000 mg twice a week) in a classical 3+3 subjects (for each platinum-based chemotherapy regimens separately) approach with predefined dose- and schedule reduction rules.

 In the safety run-in 12 subjects were included and evaluated for safety and feasibility of different escalating doses of cilengitide administered twice weekly in combination with cetuximab, cisplatin and vinorelbine or gemcitabine.

 After completion of the safety run-in, the randomized part will be started, during which all subjects will receive cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine or cisplatin/gemcitabine).

 Subjects will be centrally randomized on a 1:1 basis to either Group A or C; Group B will be closed with implementation of Amendment No.

 4 (dated 20 December 2010): cent Group A: Cilengitide 2000 mg once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 3-week chemotherapy cycle) in combination with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy that will consist of the following: - Cetuximab once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), plus cisplatin on Day 1 and vinorelbine on Days 1 and 8 of every 3-week chemotherapy cycle, or - Cetuximab once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), plus cisplatin on Day 1 and gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 of every 3-week chemotherapy cycle.

 The decision which of the 2 chemotherapy regimens will be applied for a given subject is at the discretion of the treating investigator.

 cent Group B: Cilengitide 2000 mg twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of every 3-week chemotherapy cycle) in combination with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy as described for Group A.

 Group B will be closed with implementation of Amendment No.

 4 (global, dated 20 December 2010).

 Subjects randomized to Group B before implementation of Amendment No 4 will continue to be treated as planned.

 cent Group C: Cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy as described for Group A Chemotherapy will be given until radiographically documented progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity but for no more than 6 cycles.

 Cilengitide and cetuximab will be given until radiographically documented PD or unacceptable toxicity.

 Randomization will be performed centrally using an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS).

 A stratified block randomization procedure will be employed using chosen first-line chemotherapy (cisplatin/vinorelbine versus cisplatin/gemcitabine) as stratification criterion.
