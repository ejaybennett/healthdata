(fifthQuint)Interdisciplinary Study of Two Novel Anticonvulsants in Alcoholism.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study with 4 treatment groups; levetiracetam, zonisamide, topiramate, and placebo control.

 This study evaluated the effects of zonisamide (400 mg per day) on alcohol consumption and its neurotoxic effects in subjects with AUDS.

 A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted using two comparator anticonvulsant drugs, topiramate (300 mg daily) and levetiracetam (2000 mg/day), which does not impair cognition.

 Topiramate was used as an active control in this study.

 Study medications were administered for 14 weeks, including a 2-week taper period.

 Target maintenance doses of study medications were administered to subjects during study weeks 8-12.

 Dosage reductions were made if needed to allow subjects to tolerate their study medication.

 During the medication taper phase of the study (Weeks 13-14) the Principal Investigator is allowed flexibility in the titration schedule in instances when the subject is experiencing events consistent with withdrawal, for example anxiety.

 Neurotoxicity of study drugs was assessed using neuropsychological tests and the AB-Neurotoxicity scale.

 An adaptive randomization procedures with sex and heavy drinking history being factors in the assignment of subjects to the treatment groups.

 will be done using sex and very heavy drinking.

 Very heavy drinking is defined as male subjects consuming more then 10 standard drinks per day and female subjects consuming more then 8 standard drinks per day for more then 40 percent of the days in the screening TLFB.

 Medication adherence was facilitated using Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment.

 It is a brief, standardized therapy that emphasizes medication adherence as being crucial to the improvement of drinking behavior.

 Subject assessments included, but were not limited to the following: 1) TLFB, 2) Adverse Events (AEs) assessment ,3) A-B Neurotoxicity Scale (weeks 1,4,8,12,15),and 4) Neuropsychological battery Assessments- including the Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) and Digit and Spatial Span portions of the Wechsler Memory Scale- 3rd (weeks 1,12).

 Interdisciplinary Study of Two Novel Anticonvulsants in Alcoholism@highlight

This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study with 4 treatment groups; levetiracetam, zonisamide, topiramate, and placebo control.

 Subjects will receive study medications for 14 weeks.

 Potential subjects will be initially screened for interest in study participation and alcohol consumption level to determine basic eligibility by telephone, or in person.

 Individuals who meet telephone screening criteria will be scheduled for a clinic appointment to obtain informed consent and conduct screening assessments.

 Subjects who report average drinks per day that are within the guidelines for safe levels of alcohol consumption (i.

e.

 2 drinks/ day males; 1 drink/day females-HHS standard) in the two weeks prior to screening will be excluded.

 Subjects meeting screening criteria will be scheduled for a second randomization visit.

 During this visit baseline assessments will be obtained.

 Eligible subjects will then be randomized to a treatment group and will be provided with the first week's study medications.

 The goal is to directly compare the efficacy and tolerability of two novel anticonvulsants, zonisamide and levetiracetam, with placebo, and using topiramate, which has extensive evidence supporting its efficacy in alcoholism, as a positive control group.

 We believe that this will be the first direct comparison of these agents in alcoholism, and the results will provide information on the efficacy and safety of the medications.
