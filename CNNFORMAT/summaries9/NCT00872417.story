(fifthQuint)Study on the Antiviral Therapy and Immune Reconstitution of Chinese HIV/AIDS Patients.

 Three arms will be studied in this research, 520 naive-treatment patients would be randomized to two groups, taking the generic drugs 3TC+D4T+NVP or AZT+3TC+NVP, 6 months later half of the 3TC+D4T+NVP group will switch to AZT+3TC+NVP, in order to observe the efficiency and safety of the first line drugs.

 Arm 2 will recruit 100 patients who are taking ARV for about three years already.

 Arm 3 will recruit 150 patients who have a Viral load of more than 1000 copies/ml, i.

e.

, drug resistance.

 The second line drug 3TC+TDF+LPV/RTV will given to them and the safety and efficiency will be observed.

 All patients should be explored in terms of the clinical features, drugs side-effects, and immunological and viral response.

 The drug concentration and the metabolism changes would be explored also.

 Also the immune reconstitution will be studied for all patients.

 This study will be the first large-scale, multicentered, randomised, prospective ARV therapy study in China for HIV/AIDs patients.

 The result would provide proves for further practical antiviral therapy for China or other resource limited countries.

 Study on the Antiviral Therapy and Immune Reconstitution of Chinese HIV/AIDS Patients@highlight

This study will recruit 520 treatment-naive and 150 treatment-experienced patients to take the first line or second line of antiviral therapy.

 This study aims to set up a well-trained clinical and laboratory team in China, to explore the effects and side-effects of the first-line and the second line of ARV treatment in Chinese HIV/AIDS adult patients, to investigate the side-effects of ARV drugs, such as hepatotoxicity, lipoatrophy, cardiovascular influence, to explore the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of Chinese generic ARV regiments and effective drug concentrations and to explore primary and secondary drug resistance in China and the immune reconstitution characters of long term ARV in Chinese adult AIDS patients.

 This study might provide more practical and optimizing prove for the treatment guideline for resource limited areas.
