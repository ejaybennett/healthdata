(secondQuint)Anticholinergic Therapy for Overactive Bladder in Parkinson's Disease.

 This study will be a double-blinded cross-over clinical trial design to assess the prevalence of cognitive effects, the efficacy, and the effect on quality of life (QOL) of two anticholinergic medications commonly used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB): oxybutynin and darifenacin.

 This will be done by use of a well-established and validated computer-based cognitive battery.

 Secondary endpoints will assess efficacy of anticholinergic therapy on symptoms of OAB via QOL questionnaire and participant urinary diaries.
