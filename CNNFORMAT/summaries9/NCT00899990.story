(secondQuint)Collecting and Storing Biological Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma.

 OBJECTIVES: I.

 Collect biological specimens, including associated demographic and clinical data, from patients with Ewing sarcoma.

 II.

 Provide a repository for long-term storage of Ewing sarcoma-related biological materials.

 III.

 Make collected specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of Ewing sarcoma and correlate these results with demographic and clinical data.

 OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

 Patients undergo collection of tumor specimens, bone marrow, and peripheral blood at diagnosis.

 Associated demographic and clinical data are collected and archived.

 Patients who are not enrolled on a therapeutic clinical trial are followed annually.
