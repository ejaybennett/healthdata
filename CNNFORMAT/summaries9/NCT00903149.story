 Long-term Effect of The Mother Infant Transaction Program (MITP)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to investigate if a cost and time effective intervention in a previous RCT for preterm infants and their parents can reduce the parents experience of concern and stress, and improve the childrens development in various aspects at three years of corrected age.

 Hypothesis 1: The preterm born children of parents who were enrolled in the earlier RCT have a higher developmental level then preterm children of parents who received the usual treatment.

 Hypothesis 2: Parents who who were enrolled in the earlier RCT will have a lower level of stress and concern then parents who received treatment as usual.
