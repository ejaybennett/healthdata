(thirdQuint)Study of Radiation (RT) Concurrent With Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).

 Primary Objective 1: Determine changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling and novel phosphoproteins following a loading dose of cetuximab in patients who are poor candidates for chemoradiation (age =70 years or with significant co-morbidities) and are therefore treated with cetuximab with radiation.

 Primary Objective 2: Characterize clinical outcomes, including local recurrence, progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients, and correlate these clinical outcomes with the changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling, and novel phosphoproteins.

 Primary Objective 3: Describe the toxicity, in particular mucositis/dysphagia, of this regimen.

 Secondary Objective 1: Conduct normal mucosa EGFR assessment for comparison with tumor sample.

 Secondary Objective 2: Correlate HPV presence and titer with p53 status and clinical outcome.

 Study of Radiation (RT) Concurrent With Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)@highlight

This is a single-arm, phase II trial to characterize the clinical outcome of standard of care, cetuximab concurrent with radiation, in a special population (head and neck cancer patients who cannot tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to advanced age, poor performance status or concurrent illness), and to determine if biomarker response to a loading dose of cetuximab is predictive of that outcome.
