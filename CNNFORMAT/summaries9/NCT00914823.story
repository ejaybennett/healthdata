(thirdQuint)Administration of Kisspeptin to Subjects With Reproductive Disorders.

 The master reproductive hormone GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is essential for normal reproductive function.

 People with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), hyperprolactinemia, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not secrete or respond to GnRH in a normal way.

 In this study, investigators will give participants, kisspeptin- a hormone that is naturally found in the human body and is known to be a powerful stimulus of GnRH secretion.

 They may also give participants GnRH to determine if participants will be able to fully respond to kisspeptin.

 The goal of this study is to use kisspeptin administration to probe the condition of GnRH neurons in people with various reproductive disorders to better understand the underlying reasons for the disorders.

 Investigators hope to gain new insights into GnRH neuronal function (or dysfunction) that will lead to better diagnostics in the future.

 The investigators are seeking men and women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and hyperprolactinemia, as well as women with PCOS.

 Study participation involves 1 to 2 outpatient visits and 1 to 2, 3-15-hour hospital admission(s) where participants will receive kisspeptin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) through an intravenous line (IV).

 Remuneration is up to $800 for study completion.

 Administration of Kisspeptin to Subjects With Reproductive Disorders@highlight

The investigators are seeking participants for a study of the role of kisspeptin in the reproductive system.

 Kisspeptin is a naturally occuring hormone in humans that stimulates the production of reproductive hormones.

 The investigators hypothesize that kisspeptin administration will be a useful tool for characterizing certain reproductive disorders.
