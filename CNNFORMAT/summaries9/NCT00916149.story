(thirdQuint)Cognitive Effects of Treatment of Interictal Discharges.

 Subjects with seizures will be studied with electroencephalography (EEG) and offered medication for prevention of recurrent seizures.

 Those with focal seizures will be treated with levetiracetam, and those with generalized seizures will be treated with lamotrigine.

 Subjects will undergo repeated EEG with concurrent cognitive testing before and after initiation of treatment.

 The proposed study tests 3 hypotheses: 1.

 that treatment with levetiracetam will reduce focal interictal epileptiform activity, 2.

 that treatment with lamotrigine will reduce generalized interictal epileptiform activity, and 3.

 that the extent of interictal epileptiform activity is inversely associated with performance on neuropsychological batteries and computerized cognitive testing.

 Repeated cognitive/neuropsychological testing obtained at steady state of the study drug and again after approximately 2 months on the final dosage will serve to evaluate the timecourse of potential cognitive benefits.

 Cognitive Effects of Treatment of Interictal Discharges@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine if levetiracetam (for patients with focal seizures) or lamotrigine (for patients with generalized seizures) reduces the occurrence of interictal discharges.

 The study investigates the possible correlation between reduction of interictal discharges and improved cognitive performance.
