(fifthQuint)SERIES III RUN-IN Clinical Trial: A Comparison of the Supralimus Stent With the Xience V Stent.

 Series III Run-In is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind (patient-blind), non-inferiority trial to be conducted at approx.

 35 interventional cardiology centers in India, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand and Saudi Aurabia.

 A total of 360 will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to either the Supralimus(R) (sirolimus-eluting) stent or the Xience V cent (everolimus-eluting) stent.

 In selected sites, IVUS will also be recorded in these patients (maximum of 60 IVUS patients in total), at baseline (post-procedure) and at 9-month follow-up.

 All patients will be followed clinically for up to 5 years after stent implantation.

 Repeat angiography will be performed in all patients at 9 months after the index procedure.

 SERIES III RUN-IN Clinical Trial: A Comparison of the Supralimus Stent With the Xience V Stent@highlight

The objective of Series III Run-In Trial is to compare the performance and efficacy of the Supralimus(R) sirolimus-eluting stent with the Xience V cent everolimus-eluting stent with respect to in-stent luminal late loss at 9 months as assessed by off-line QCA.

 Ninety percent power to reject the null hypothesis that the Supralimus(R) stent is inferior to Xience V cent in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the Supralimus(R) stent is not inferior to Xience V cent .
