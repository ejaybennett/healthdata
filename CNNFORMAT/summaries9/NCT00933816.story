 In Phase I, there will be 9 to 18 patients enrolled.

 Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive escalated dose of cisplatin and fluorouracil until the MTD is reached.

 There will be no intra-patient dose escalation.

 Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400mg bid for 28 days in the all patients.

 Cisplatin at the dose of 10-20mg/m2 will be administered at day 1 and day8, and fluorouracil at the dose of 170-330mg/m2 will be administered continuously at day1-day5, and day8-day12 via the implanted catheter system.

 A cycle is defined as 28 days and 3 cycles of this combination therapy will be continued.

 At the end of each cycle, adverse effect will be evaluated and dose escalation will be determined.
