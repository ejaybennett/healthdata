(firstQuint)Yohimbine to Enhance Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Social Anxiety.

8 mg) or placebo during core exposure sessions.

 Based on the available evidence, the investigators hypothesize that acute treatment with Yohimbine hydrochloride prior to exposure-based CBT would facilitate the extinction of fear that occurs with this treatment and would enhance treatment outcome.
