(secondQuint)Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Complete Remission.

 OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the tolerability of autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission.

 Secondary - Evaluate the emergence of an immune response.

 - Determine the relapse rate.

 - Assess the occurrence of residual disease.

 OUTLINE: Patients receive increasing doses of blastic cells transformed in vitro by autologous dendritic cells (1/3 subcutaneously and 2/3 IV) every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses.

RATIONALE: Vaccines made from dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

 PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission.
