(fifthQuint)Paclitaxel and CBT-1(Registered Trademark) to Treat Solid Tumors.

 Background: This is a pharmacodynamic study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of CBT-1(Registered Trademark) as a modulator of Pgp-mediated drug efflux in patient tumors and normal tissues.

 The study will build on over a decade of experience with 99mTc-sestamibi imaging and rhodamine accumulation and efflux in normal circulating CD56 plus cells as surrogates for Pgp function.

 CBA Research, Inc.

, has carried out Phase I and II testing of CBT-1(Registered Trademark) as a drug resistance reversal agent, but has not yet confirmed that the inhibitor is able to block drug efflux.

 Objectives: Evaluate the impact of CBT-1(Registered Trademark) on the hepatic accumulation and retention of 99mTc-sestamibi in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumor malignancies.

 Evaluate the impact of CBT-1(Registered Trademark) on P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux from CD56 plus peripheral mononuclear cells.

 Eligibility: Patients over 18 years of age who have histologic confirmation of relapsed/refractory cancer, following at least once standard treatment regimen, for whom there is no known standard therapy option capable of extending life expectancy.

 Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or better, and have hematologic, renal, hepatic, and metabolic parameters suggestive of adequate organ function.

 Design: Patients will be treated according to CBA Research Phase II trial of CBT-1 and Taxol.

 Patients will begin protocol treatment with orally administered CBT-1(Registered Trademark) in two or three divided doses daily for 7 days.

 On day 6, 135 mg/m^2 paclitaxel will be administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.

 Prior to the initiation of CBT-1(Registered Trademark), and on Day 6, patients will undergo blood sampling for the rhodamine assay in CD56 plus circulating mononuclear cells.

 In addition, patients will undergo imaging of tumors and normal tissue with the 99mTc-sestamibi radionuclide scan.

 These two assays have shown convincing inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug efflux in past studies with Pgp inhibitors such as tariquidar and valspodar.

 Twelve patients are planned for enrollment to this study, which is powered to determine a difference between the control scan and the post-treatment scan but not to compare CBT-1(Registered Trademark) with previous inhibitors tested in the intramural program.

 Paclitaxel and CBT-1(Registered Trademark) to Treat Solid Tumors@highlight

Background: - Some cancer cells have a large amount of a protein called P-glycoprotein, which can pump certain chemotherapy drugs out of their cells.

 This pump may be part of the reason why it is difficult to shrink some cancers with chemotherapy.

 - In laboratory experiments, the drug CBT-1(Registered Trademark) blocked the P-glycoprotein pump, resulting in accumulation of higher amounts of chemotherapy inside the cancer cells, making the chemotherapy more effective.

 - Paclitaxel is a cancer drug that has caused tumors to shrink in many types of cancers, including lung, ovarian, breast, renal, cervical and others.

 Objectives: - To determine whether CBT-1(Registered Trademark) can block the P-glycoprotein pump on cancer cells and whether it inhibits the action of the pump found in normal blood cells and liver tissue.

 - To evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy using CBT-1(Registered Trademark) and paclitaxel in treating solid tumors and to determine whether the two drugs together are more effective than paclitaxel alone.

 Eligibility: -Patients over 18 years of age who have a solid tumor that cannot be treated successfully with standard treatments.

 Design: -Patients receive CBT-1(Registered Trademark) and paclitaxel in 21-day cycles.

 Treatment continues for two cycles after all the cancer is gone, or until it is decided to surgically remove some or all of the remaining cancer, or until the cancer has grown to the point where it defined as progressive disease.

 For each cycle, patients take CBT-1(Registered Trademark) by mouth in three divided doses daily for 7 days.

 On day 6, paclitaxel is given through a vein over 3 hours.

 Blood tests are done before starting CBT-1(Registered Trademark) and repeated periodically throughout treatment.

 Imaging studies computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (CT or MRI) are done every two cycles.

 In addition, for the first cycle only, patients undergo imaging of tumors and normal tissue with a 99mTc-sestamibi radionuclide scan before and after administration of CBT-1(Registered Trademark).

 This scan helps show how well the P-glycoprotein pump is being blocked by the treatment.
