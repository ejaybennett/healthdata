(secondQuint)Clinical Outcome of Pacemaker paTIents According to Pacing Modality and Primary INDications.

 The principal objective of the OPTI-MIND study is to collect data on two-year all-cause mortality in a general population implanted with a PM according to current clinical practice.

 Additionally, the study aims to stratify the outcome by both known patient-related risk factors and by physiologic pacing mode setting (a specifically defined PM programming).

 Stratification will be done for pre-specified classes of patients on the basis of their primary rhythm disease.
