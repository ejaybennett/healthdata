(secondQuint)The Effect of Uric Acid Decrement on Endothelial Function in Patients With Chronic Renal Failure.

 Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a key event in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

 Experimental models have shown that hyperuricemia causes hypertension and renin angiotensin system activation.

 In this prospective study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of improved hyperuricemia, a minor cardiovascular risk factor, on ED in patients with CKD.
