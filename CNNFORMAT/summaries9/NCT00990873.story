(thirdQuint)Study of Tissue Samples From Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Enrolled on Research Study CALGB-140202.

 OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether the 64-gene signature can accurately predict the prognosis for survival of patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 OUTLINE: RNA is purified from tissue samples obtained by the CALGB Lung Cancer Study (CALGB-140202).

 The RNA samples are used for gene expression analysis using the 64-gene signature and an Affymetrix-HG_U133A array.

 Reverse-transcriptase PCR may also be performed on selected samples.

RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

 It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

 PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples from patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer enrolled on research study CALGB-140202.
