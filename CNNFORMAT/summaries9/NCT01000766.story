(firstQuint)Identifying Changes in Blood (Potential Biomarkers) in Individuals With Drug-Induced Liver Injury.

 The purpose of this study is to try to develop new blood tests that may help doctors identify if a drug is hurting a person's liver, perhaps early in the process before significant injury or illness have occurred.
