(fifthQuint)Maraviroc (Celsentri) With Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of Triple Class Failure in Adult HIV-1 Infected Patients.

 This is a Phase 4, single arm, open-label, study designed to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, antiviral and immunological activity of Maraviroc in combination with Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir in patients with limited to no treatment option in HIV-1 infected subjects 21 years old.

 The trial population will comprise 60 HIV-infected subjects with history of triple class antiretroviral failure, naive to CCR5-inhibitors, integrase-inhibitors and darunavir will be evaluated.

 Single arm, stratified according to plasma viral load at screening (> or < 100,000 copies/ml).

 Those with evidence of R5 viruses and susceptibility to darunavir in the resistance testing analysis, plus history of failure to NRTIs, NNRTIs and at least one PI, plus a genotype analysis showing evidence of resistance to NRTIs (at least 2 TAMS and/or Q151M and or 69ss), resistance to PIs (at least 2 major mutations), will start a regimen of maraviroc, raltegravir and ritonavir boosted darunavir.

 This trial will consist of a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a 48-week treatment period, with interim analysis at 16 and 24 weeks.

 Followed by a 4-week post-treatment follow-up (FU) period.

 Virologic response, CD4 count change, clinical outcomes and safety will be followed throughout the study.

 Maraviroc (Celsentri) With Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of Triple Class Failure in Adult HIV-1 Infected Patients@highlight

Phase 4, single arm, open label study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of antiviral activity and immunological effect of Maraviroc in combination with Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir for treatment of triple class failure in adult HIV-1 infected subjects.

 The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and efficacy of a combination of 3 new antiretroviral drugs: maraviroc, darunavir and raltegravir in patients who have multi-resistant viruses and limited treatment options.

 Patients will undergo treatment for 48 weeks; safety and virological efficacy will be preliminary evaluated at weeks 16 and 24.
