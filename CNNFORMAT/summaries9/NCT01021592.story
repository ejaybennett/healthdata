(fifthQuint)Quality of Life in Multiple Myeloma Patients Treated With Bortezomib.

 Many clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma have been conducted in Korea, but none of them have evaluated the improvement in the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma.

 Most study variables used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with multiple myeloma are subjective and limited.

 This study will observe the degree of change in the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma before and after bortezomib administration by using EORTC-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30) and EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions), validated research instruments used to measure the quality of life in cancer patients and consequently will provide fundamental data regarding the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma.

 Quality of Life in Multiple Myeloma Patients Treated With Bortezomib@highlight

This observational study will observe the degree of the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma before and after bortezomib administration by using EORTC-QLQ C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30) and EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions).

 Both tools are validated research instruments used to measure the quality of life in cancer patients and consequently will provide fundamental data regarding the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma by analyzing factors that affect the quality of life.
