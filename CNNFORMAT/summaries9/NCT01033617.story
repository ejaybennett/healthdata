(thirdQuint)IMPACT-CABG Trial: IMPlantation of Autologous CD133+ sTem Cells in Patients Undergoing CABG.

 CD133+ are well-characterized distinct early progenitor group of stem cells that possess high engraftment, pluripotent and angiogenic capacity and proved to be valuable for cardiac repair by promoting neovascularization, inhibition of apoptosis and cardiomyogenesis.

 Our proposed research protocol involves patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

 In this phase II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, 2 arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we will assess the safety, feasibility and functional effect of intra-myocardial injection of highly selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells to placebo.

 IMPACT-CABG Trial: IMPlantation of Autologous CD133+ sTem Cells in Patients Undergoing CABG@highlight

Following myocardial infarct, cellular therapy is a potential approach to repopulate the injured myocardium, to treat heart failure and restore cardiac function.

 The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of intramyocardial delivery of selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells at time of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.
