(fifthQuint)Frovatriptan as a Transitional Therapy in Medication Overuse Headache.

 A single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is proposed to assess Frovatriptan as a transitional therapy in patients diagnosed with medication overuse headache.

 Currently, there are no proven transitional therapies to help patients get through the detoxification process.

 Frovatriptan has not been tested as a transitional therapy in the past.

 This study will compare Frovatriptan, taken over a 10 day transitional period, to placebo.

 The primary outcome of the study will be the mean headache intensity in the 10 day transitional period in the Frovatriptan group as compared to the placebo group.

 A number of secondary and exploratory outcomes will also be determined and further data collection will occur at 1, 2, and 3 month periods.

 The duration of the study for the participants will be 3 months, and they will be asked to keep detailed headache diaries during this time.

 Ten days of baseline headache diaries will also be performed before patients can enter the study.

 Frovatriptan as a Transitional Therapy in Medication Overuse Headache@highlight

This study will analyze the effectiveness of a medication called Frovatriptan, in the context of medication overuse headache (MOH).

 MOH is a headache that develops when pain-killers are taken frequently.

 The treatment is to stop the overuse of these pain-killers, but that can sometimes worsen the headache first before it gets better.

 We are testing Frovatriptan against placebo to see if it can help patients with this transition and avoid the worsening of the headache that can occur.

 We will also see if Frovatriptan can help in other ways, such as maintain patients free of medication overuse.
