(secondQuint)Antimicrobial De-escalation Strategy in Medical Patients.

 This is an open-label, case-control, pilot study involving medical patients with serious infections who are prescribed meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, at Surrey Memorial Hospital.

 Patients in the experimental arm (cases) will be required to provide an informed consent.

 A team consisting of an infectious diseases specialist, medical microbiologist and clinical pharmacists will prospectively assess antimicrobial therapy in the enrolled subjects in the prospective arm and make recommendations for antimicrobial de-escalation.

 The control group will consist of subjects drawn from historic data of patients on the same medical unit(s) who will be matched based on age, sex, use of broadspectrum antibiotics (meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam) and infectious diseases diagnosis.
