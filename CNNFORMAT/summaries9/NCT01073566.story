(secondQuint)Feasibility Study of Finesse for Bolus Prandial Insulin Dosing Compared to Multiple Daily Injections.

 The aim of this feasibility study is to compare efficacy, device satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes delivering mealtime insulin using a novel insulin bolus-patch (Finesse cent ; Calibra Medical, Inc.

, Redwood City, CA) versus current devices that deliver bolus insulin (pen/syringe).

 All subjects injected their basal insulin using their current pen/syringe.
