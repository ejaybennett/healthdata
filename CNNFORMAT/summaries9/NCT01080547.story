(thirdQuint)Study Comparing Conventional and Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment Interventions for Colorectal Cancer.

 Laparoscopic Surgery, Fast Track Treatment and XELOX Chemotherapy have been introduced in the treatment of colorectal cancer.

 All of these procedures are contributed to reduce the hospitalization stay.

 However, the most economical mode for combination of these procedures is still unclear.

 This is a randomized controlled study, a new notion"Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" is proposed, which is the combination of the Laparoscopic Surgery, Fast track perioperative treatment during perioperative period and XELOX Chemotherapy.

 The purpose of this study is to compare the Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment with the conventional treatment(Open Surgery with conventional treatment during perioperative period and mFolfox6 chemotherapy) for colorectal cancer on several aspects like the average hospitalization day, complications, costs and quality of life.

The focus of the study will be to investigate whether the Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment reduces hospital stay with similar complications compared with conventional perioperative treatment.

 Moreover, the trial will clarify whether laparoscopic surgery is essential for Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment.
