(firstQuint)Immunological Change and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder.

Many children suffered from this disease and had impact on their daily life.

 However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain to be elucidate.

 Dysregulation of the gut immune system is considered an important pathophysiology.

 We want to investigate the immunological changes in the IBS children.
