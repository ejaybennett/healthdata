(thirdQuint)Prostate Cancer Localization With a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (MR) Approach.

 Goal Proving that multi-parametric MR imaging in a multi-centre setting allows for localizing clinically significant (volume > 0.

5cc; Gleason > 6) prostate carcinoma in the prostate.

 Objective 1 To determine the diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve) of 3-Tesla multi-modality non-endorectal coil (ERC) MR imaging in localizing prostate cancer, by correlating: 1.

 focal areas of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images; 2.

 the extent and degree of deviating metabolite ratios derived from MRSI.

 This can be the choline+creatine/citrate ratio or if possible, the choline / citrate ratio; 3.

 the extent and degree of apparent diffusion coefficient reduction on DWI; 4.

 the extent and degree of perfusion abnormality on DCE-MRI; with the presence or absence of cancer at (reconstructed) whole mount section histopathology.

 Objective 2 Proving that multi-modality MR data allows for predicting tumor grade.

 The parameters from the different MR methods for a tumor focus can be correlated to the local Gleason grade of the corresponding lesion in the histopathological specimens.

 Prostate Cancer Localization With a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (MR) Approach@highlight

The primary objective of this prospective multi-centre study is to prove the diagnostic accuracy of in vivo 3T multi-modality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (high resolution T2-weighted MRI, DCE-MRI, MRSI and DWI techniques) in distinguishing carcinoma from other prostate tissue.

 The gold standard for distinguishing the tissue types is the analysis of whole-mount sections of the resected prostate by a genitourinary histopathologist.
