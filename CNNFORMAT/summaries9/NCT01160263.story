(thirdQuint)Study of Dopamine and Serotonin Transporters in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Controls.

 Study design This study is a prospective cross-sectional controlled multicentric clinical study in 60 ALS patients and 20 controls.

 Three cohorts of 20 ALS patients(patients without stiffness, patients with pyramidal stiffness, patients with mixed pyramidal and extra pyramidal stiffness) and 20 healthy controls will be included in this study Study centres 40 ALS patients and 13 controls will be included in the Paris ALS center, 20 ALS patients and 7 controls will be included in the Tours ALS center.

 MRI will be performed at the Neuroradiology department of salpetriere hospital (Paris) and Bretonneau hospital (Tours) SPECT will be done in the nuclear medicine center of each hospital (Paris- Tours).

 Study duration Per patient or control, the study will be lasted one month.

 The total study duration will be two years.

 Study of Dopamine and Serotonin Transporters in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Controls@highlight

The purpose of this study is to study the transporters of serotonin and dopamine in ALS patients in relation with the clinical phenotype, i.

e.

, patients without stiffness, patients with pyramidal stiffness, patients with mixed (pyramidal and extra pyramidal) stiffness.

 For such a goal the investigators will use SPECT to compare the binding of two specific tracers in ALS patients and in matched healthy controls.
