(secondQuint)Randomized Crossover Trial to Assess the Tolerability of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Analogue Administration.

 GnRH is given as an injection.

 Injections of GnRH can be uncomfortable, causing a feeling of burning or stinging.

 The uncomfortable feeling may be caused by differences in the types of GnRH and the site of the injection (under the skin of the abdomen, or into the muscle of the buttock or thigh).
