(firstQuint)A Research Study Looking at Specific Tissue of the Umbilical Cord.

 Our working hypothesis is that umbilical cord blood Wharton's Jelly matrix has all the biochemical and biomechanical characteristics needed in an ideal scaffold for tissue engineering.

 Accordingly, we expect matrix to support the growth and differentiation of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells.

 The first step in this effort is to isolate Wharton's Jelly matrix by decellularization.

 The second step will be to test the ability of this matrix to support the growth and differentiation of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells.

 The third step will be to pursue preliminary animal testing to study the ability of this matrix to support bone tissue regeneration in vivo.
