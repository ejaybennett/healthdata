(firstQuint)A Drug Interaction Study of Warfarin and Canagliflozin in Healthy Adult Volunteers.

 This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned) single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and warfarin in healthy adult volunteers.

 Canagliflozin is a drug currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and warfarin is an approved anticoagulant (ie, a drug that stops blood from clotting).

 After an overnight fast (without eating food) of at least 10 hours, volunteers will receive Sequence 1 (canagliflozin 300 mg, orally, once daily on Days 1-12 with a single, oral 30 mg dose of warfarin on Day 6 [Treatment A] followed 14 days later by a single, oral 30 mg dose of warfarin on Day 1 [Treatment B]) OR Sequence 2 (Treatment B followed 14 days later by Treatment A).
