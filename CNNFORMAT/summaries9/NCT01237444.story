(thirdQuint)Study of Lopinavir/ Ritonavir and Lamivudine Versus Standard Therapy in Nave HIV-1 Infected Subjects.

.

 Combination therapy with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) has been the mainstay of therapy for over 10 years, based on sound evidence derived from randomized controlled clinical trials and epidemiological data.

A variety of new approaches designed to address the problems associated with combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are currently being explored.

 These include strategic treatment interruptions to reduce time on therapy, toxicity and cost;Based on its performance, a dual drug combination that includes lopinavir/ritonavir and spares the more toxic NRTIs such as thymidine nucleoside-analogs, but maintains non-thymidine nucleoside-analogs appears as a potentially simple, safe and effective regimen.

 Study of Lopinavir/ Ritonavir and Lamivudine Versus Standard Therapy in Nave HIV-1 Infected Subjects.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and immunological effect of lopinavir/ritonavir plus lamivudine (3TC) versus standard therapy with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of naive HIV-1 infected subjects.
