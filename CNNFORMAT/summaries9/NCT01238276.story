(fifthQuint)Direct Antibiotic Delivery of Cefazolin Into Soft Tissue Infections Using Subcutaneous Injection and Ultrasonic Dispersion.

 In this study, the DOSAGE of cefazolin that is delivered is a fraction of that which is already FDA approved for intramuscular (IM) administration.

 However, the CONCENTRATION in the target area is much higher than what can be achieved through intravenous (IV) administration, while still being far less than what is approved for IM administration.

 Previous to this study, cefazolin was considered to be ineffective in treating Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as it had only been tested at the concentrations that were attainable by traditional methods.

 Through our study and laboratory tests conducted at the Harford Hospital, Connecticut, we have confirmed that cefazolin can be effective against even the most resistant strains of MRSA if a high enough concentration is obtained.

 Under this study, treatment is only available to subjects that have already undergone standard therapy, but were not able to resolve the infection.

 Direct Antibiotic Delivery of Cefazolin Into Soft Tissue Infections Using Subcutaneous Injection and Ultrasonic Dispersion@highlight

This study focuses on a new drug delivery system (Direct Antibiotic Delivery) to treat soft tissue infections.

 In this study, cefazolin is delivered directly to the target tissues using subcutaneous injection of antibiotic solution and then dispersed using high-frequency external ultrasound.

 Using this system, a much higher concentration of antibiotic can be achieved than through traditional treatment methods.

 Unlike traditional delivery methods, Direct Antibiotic Delivery does not rely on blood supply and is beneficial for subjects with Diabetes or subjects who have received radiation therapy and blood supply is limited.
