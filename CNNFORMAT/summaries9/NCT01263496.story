(secondQuint)Long-term Safety Study of Alogliptin in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes in Japan.

 Both insulin hyposecretion and insulin-resistance are considered to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme.

 DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion.

 It is expected that inhibition of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

 To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, this extension study was administered for 40 consecutive weeks (52 weeks from the start of treatment in the phase 2 dose-ranging study) to participants who had completed the phase 2 dose-ranging study SYR-322/CCT-001 (NCT01263470).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of SYR-322, once daily (QD), to an -glucosidase inhibitor, three times daily (TID), administered for 40 consecutive weeks in participants who completed a phase 2 dose-ranging study.
