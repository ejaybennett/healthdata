(fifthQuint)Outcomes After Perforator Flap Reconstruction for Breast Reconstruction and/or Lymphedema Treatment.

 Breast cancer is a serious health issue that affects 1 in 8 women.

 Although numerous treatments have arisen in recent years to aggressively combat this disease and increase survivorship, many survivors develop a crippling condition that can result in devastating physical and psychological impairments.

 Breast reconstruction by any method may help recovery psychologically.

 However, some individuals still report experiencing pain following their recovery from surgery.

 Additionally, secondary lymphedema is a common yet poorly understood complication of breast cancer patients.

 For those individuals who undergo axillary lymph node dissection the rates of incidence of lymphedema approach 47%.

 These rates tend to increase further for patients who receive irradiation treatment or mastectomies.

 Currently there is no known cure for lymphedema.

 Current treatments include non-invasive measures as well as surgical interventions.

 Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNTx) is a fairly recent surgical procedure that has shown promising results.

 The goal of this research study is to analyze the clinical outcome of subjects who undergo breast reconstruction with perforator flaps and/or VLNTx using information collected as part of standard care.

 Clinical data will be collected prospectively.

 All subjects who undergo a surgical procedure will complete the online persistent postsurgical pain assessment questionnaire.

 The BreastQ questionnaire will be completed by patients prior to and after undergoing breast reconstruction and/or lymphedema treatment.

 Outcomes After Perforator Flap Reconstruction for Breast Reconstruction and/or Lymphedema Treatment@highlight

The goal of this prospective, observational study is to investigate the clinical, psychosocial, and patient satisfaction outcomes of patients who undergo perforator flap reconstruction for breast reconstruction and/or vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNTx) for the treatment of lymphedema.

 The investigators hypothesize that (1) perforator flap breast reconstruction will result in excellent clinical, psychosocial, and patient satisfaction outcomes compared to non-perforator flap breast reconstruction; (2) perforator flap breast reconstruction is associated with less persistent postsurgical pain than other forms of breast reconstruction, even after controlling for major cofactors, such as the extent of auxiliary lymph node dissection and the use of radiation therapy; (3) perforator flap reconstruction for the treatment of Lymphedema (i.

e.

, VLNTx ) will result in the reduction of symptoms and complications of lymphedema.
