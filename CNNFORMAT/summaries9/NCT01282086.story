(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Volatile Induction and Maintenance Anesthesia (VIMA) With Sevorane in Adult Patients Requiring General Anesthesia for Surgery in Terms of Quality of Anesthesia and Its Influence on the Cardiovascular System in Common Clinical Practice.

 This PMOS will be conducted in a prospective, multi-centre format.

 It is a non-interventional, observational study in which Sevorane is prescribed for adult patients undergoing general surgery for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization.
