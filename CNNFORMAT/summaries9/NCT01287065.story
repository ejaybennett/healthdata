(fifthQuint)A Study in Asthmatic Patients to Determine if There is Any Difference in Dosing With Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Inhalation Powder in the Morning or Evening on Lung Function.

 This will be a repeat-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, three-way crossover study in patients with persistent bronchial asthma to compare the effect of AM and PM dosing with fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder(100/25mcg) on lung function.

 Twenty-four male and female patients will be enrolled in this study to ensure twenty evaluable subjects.

 After the screening there will be a run-in period of 14 days prior to first dose.

 Subjects will be dosed for 14 days ( 2 days) in each of the 3 treatment periods, with serial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements taken over a 24 hour period following the Day 14 PM dose in order to determine FEV1 weighted mean (0-24 hours).

 Peak expiratory flow (PEF) will also be monitored throughout the study, from the start of the run-in period until the end of the third treatment period.

 Between treatment periods there will be a washout period of 14-21 days.

 Safety assessments will include vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests, however, with the exception of AEs these will not constitute study endpoints.

 The results of the study will provide supporting information to understand the implications of time of day of dosing on the therapeutic response to the FF/VI Inhalation Powder.

 A Study in Asthmatic Patients to Determine if There is Any Difference in Dosing With Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Inhalation Powder in the Morning or Evening on Lung Function@highlight

This study will be a repeat-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, three-way crossover study in patients with persistent bronchial asthma to compare the effect of morning (AM) and evening (PM) dosing with fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder on lung function.

 Following screening there will be a run-in period of 14 days.

 There will be 3 treatment periods; drug at AM, drug at PM and placebo, which will last for 14 days each with a 14-21 day washout period between starting the next.

 Key assessments include; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests.
