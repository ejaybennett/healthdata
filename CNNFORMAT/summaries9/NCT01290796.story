(firstQuint)Clinical Evaluation of Ajust in Stress Urinary Incontinence.

 Urinary incontinence (UI), or the complaint of any involuntary loss of urine, ranges in severity from the occasional leaking urine during actions resulting in increased abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercise, etc.

) to sudden, unpredictable strong urges to void.

 Female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is attributed to a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles.

 A recent review of literature describing the prevalence of UI calculated the median prevalence of female UI to be 27.

6% (4.

8-58.

4%), with the prevalence of significant incontinence increasing with age.

 The prevalent cause of UI was further categorized into stress (50%), mixed (32%) and urge (14%).

 Nonsurgical treatment of female SUI has traditionally been limited to alpha-adrenergic agonists and estrogens, pelvic floor exercises, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and behavior modification1.

 Options for surgical treatment consists of periurethral injections of bulking agents, transvaginal suspensions, retropubic suspensions, slings and sphincter prostheses.

 The Ajust cent Adjustable Single-Incision Sling is a fully adjustable single-incision sling that anchors in the transobturator membranes, anatomically sufficient spaces for support of the urethra.
