(secondQuint)Comparative Study of Biologic Mesh Versus Repair With Component Separation.

.

 This study will involve comparison of open abdominal incisional hernia repair with XenMATRIX biologic graft versus repair with native tissue.

 The current study seeks to evaluate XenMATRIXTM, an FDA approved biologic graft for repairing contaminated abdominal wall defects.

 This study will provide significant insight for the reconstructive surgeon and patient to determine whether a biologic graft is necessary for the reconstruction of a contaminated ventral hernia repair to provide a durable single staged repair.

 Comparative Study of Biologic Mesh Versus Repair With Component Separation.

@highlight

The purpose of this study is to compare open abdominal incisional hernia repair using XenMATRIX biologic mesh versus repair with their own tissue.

 This study will provide information in determining if a biological mesh is necessary to provide a sturdy repair for a ventral hernia.
