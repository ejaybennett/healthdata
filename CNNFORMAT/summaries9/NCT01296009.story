(thirdQuint)Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on Embryo Implantation in In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) Patients.

 To demonstrate the impact of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on embryo implantation, the investigators perform a prospective randomized study on patients who have underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in the Reproductive Medical Center of the Remin Hospital Wuhan University in the next six months.

 These patients were randomly divided into two groups, one group was given traditional Chinese medicine, that is, ten days oral administration of Zhuyun recipe from the day after HCG injection.

 The second group without any treatment, and then the pregnancy rate were observed.

 Frozen embryo transfer for patients do the same treatment, measured indices were also the same in both groups.

 Our hypothesis is that Zhuyun recipe is beneficial for embryo implantation in IVF-ET patients, it can be found that pregnancy rate in traditional Chinese medicine group is higher than the control group.
