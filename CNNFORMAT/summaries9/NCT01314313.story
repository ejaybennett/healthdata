(secondQuint)The PARTNER II Trial: Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valves.

 A prospective multi-center trial of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.

 Patient cohorts will include the following groups based on operative risk for surgical aortic valve replacement: inoperable, high surgical risk (STS 8%), and intermediate risk (STS = 4-8%).

 The Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve (THV) system will be studied in patients deemed inoperable or intermediate risk.

 A subset of inoperable patients will be randomized to receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with either the SAPIEN XT THV or the SAPIEN THV.

 The SAPIEN XT will be studied in intermediate risk patients randomized to receive TAVR with the SAPIEN XT or surgical AVR.

 The Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV will be studied in a non-randomized fashion in patients from all three risk groups.

 Data will be collected from all patients for up to five years following the valve replacement procedure.

 The PARTNER II Trial: Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valves@highlight

The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards SAPIEN XT and the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve and delivery systems which are intended for use in patients with symptomatic, calcific, severe aortic stenosis.
