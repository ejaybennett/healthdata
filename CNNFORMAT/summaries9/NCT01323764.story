(thirdQuint)ShuntCheck Versus Radionuclide in Evaluating Shunt Function in Symptomatic NPH Patients.

 The primary objective is to demonstrate that the accuracy of SC and SC+MP for determining whether a VP shunt is patent or obstructed is statistically no different than the accuracy of the accepted standard test, radionuclide shunt patency study, when performed simultaneously.

 A secondary objective is to determine SC and SC+MP results in the presence of possible partial obstruction, which defined as subjects with radionuclide clearance measured by T1/2 of 8 to 10 minutes.

 A secondary objective is to compare ShuntCheck flow rate results to simultaneous radionuclide clearance as measured by T1/2.

 A secondary objective is to demonstrate that ShuntCheck flow rate results are statistically equivalent to simultaneous radionuclide clearance measured by T1/2.

The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of ShuntCheck (SC) and ShuntCheck plus Micro-Pumper (SC+MP) to radionuclide shunt patency testing (SPS) in evaluating shunt function in patients with adult hydrocephalus (AH) implanted with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts when shunt obstruction is suspected and a diagnostic procedure such as radionuclide shunt patency testing (SPS) is required.
