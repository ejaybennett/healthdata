(fifthQuint)A Phase II Trial of OSI-906 and Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer.

 The purpose of the trial is first to evaluate the safety of the combination of OSI-906 and sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

 Patients will be treated in groups of three with full dose sorafenib and OSI-906.

 If we do not observe any significant side effects, then three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level.

 After confirming the safety of the combination (possibly after first six patients) the study will proceed with regular accrual.

 The patients will receive the treatments orally and will be evaluated by physical exam, blood work and imaging.

 If the cancer is well controlled and the therapy is well tolerated then patients will continue on the trial.

 If the side effects are significant or the tumor starts to grow or the patients wishes to stop therapy the patient at that time will be taken off trial.

 The trial will collect blood samples to evaluate the level of the investigational agent in the blood.

 Also samples of the patients tumor will be analyzed to evaluate for markers that may predict who benefits from treatment.

 A Phase II Trial of OSI-906 and Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of combining a new investigational drug (OSI-906) with a standard drug (sorafenib) on the control of liver cancer (hepatocellular cancer).

 Sorafenib (brand name Nexavar(R)) is a drug that is approved for the treatment of advanced liver cancer.

 It works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels around the tumor.

 OSI-906 is an investigational agent that works by inhibiting the effects of a growth hormone on the cancer.

 The safety and efficacy of combining OSI-906 and sorafenib in the treatment of liver cancer risk not known.

 The current study will confirm the safety of the combination in the first six patients and evaluate the activity of the combination in patients with advanced liver cancer.

 In addition, the study will aim at collecting blood samples from patients to evaluate the level of OSI-906 in patients receiving the combination of the two drugs.

 The study also will collect samples of the tumor to evaluate for markers that can predict in which patient the combination is effective.
