 Evaluating Pain With Mepitel One vs.

Bridal Veil and Staples on Split Thickness Skin Grafts.

 Skin grafts are placed over excised areas of full thickness injuries and usually attached with sutures or staples.

 While useful in anchoring the graft in place, subjects often complain of pain from the staples as wound healing progresses.

Pulling and sticking are common complaints.

There is also a possibility that staples become embedded in the graft which leads to disruption of otherwise healed area, increased pain and anxiety for the subject as well as anxiety for the staff.

 Graft take can be optimized with appropriate medical management.

 Use of non-adherent dressings to protect the graft is customary.

 Various types of netting-style are used, such as Bridal veil, a sterile product which is fixed over the graft with staples.

 Silicone net dressings have also been used successfully to prevent lifting and adherence of skin grafts to the dressings, prevent pain and promote healing.

 Mepitel One is a sterile, transparent, and flexible wound contact layer consisting of perforated polyurethane film coated with Safetac soft silicone adhesive on one side.

 Mepitel One is available in various sizes and can be left in place for several days depending on the wound/skin condition.

 Evaluation of burns will be performed at Baseline.

 Skin graft assessment will be performed at Day 7 and Day 14.

 End of study will be considered the time that graft is considered to have >95% take.

 Evaluating Pain With Mepitel One vs.

Bridal Veil and Staples on Split Thickness Skin Grafts@highlight

This investigation is an open, randomised investigation.

 Approximately 40 subjects in 4-5 centres in the US with deep-partial of full thickness burns in need of skin grafts will be enrolled.

The subjects will be equally randomised to either treatment with Mepitel One or bridal veil together with staples.

 The primary objective is to compare pain at the time of dressing change for the use of Mepitel One versus bridal veil together with staples on deep partial or full thickness burns requiring skin grafts.
