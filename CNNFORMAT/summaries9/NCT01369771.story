005% eye drops (Xalatan(R)) and after the switch to preservative-free prostaglandin analog tafluprost 0.

0015% eye drops (Taflotan(R)).

 Patients who have been using latanoprost as their prior medication (at least 6 months) and who fulfil all the inclusion criteria including the specified ocular symptoms and signs, will switch from latanoprost 0.
