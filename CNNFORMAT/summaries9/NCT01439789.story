(secondQuint)Study of Efficacy on NT-proBNP of Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1 in Chronic Heart Failure Patients.

 N-terminal proNBP (NT-proBNP) has been proved to be an independent prognostic factor for the long-term prognosis of chronic heart failure patients.

RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly works on the cardiomyocytes and restored the normal structure and function of it.

 It has been found that rhNRG-1 effectively decreased the serum level of NT-proBNP,and is tolerated in the effective dosages groups.

The aim of this phase III trial is to further confirm in large population that rhRNG-1 administration can effectively decrease the serum level of NT-proBNP and is tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure.
