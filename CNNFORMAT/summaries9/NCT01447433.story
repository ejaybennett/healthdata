(firstQuint)Effect of Calcium + Vitamin D Supplementation on Weight Management in Very-low Calcium Consumers.

 Due to the contradicting findings in the hypothesis of calcium supplementation on weight and fat loss, which might be explained by the difference in initial calcium intake, the present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on accelerating weight and fat loss in overweight or obese subjects with very-low calcium consumption(<600mg/day).

 The hypotheses to be tested are: Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation is conducive to body weight and fat loss in overweight or obese young adults during energy restriction 12 weeks after randomization.
