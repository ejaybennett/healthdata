(secondQuint)Randomized Controlled Trial of Argatroban With Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) for Acute Stroke.

 Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), the only proven treatment for acute ischemic stroke, fails to reperfuse brain in most patients with large thrombi.

 In our Phase 2a low-dose safety study (n=65), the two drugs appeared safe when delivered concomitantly and recanalization rates were greater than historical controls.

 This study will provide evidence-based hypotheses and data needed to design a larger definitive trial.

 The purpose of this trial is to estimate overall treatment benefit (improvement in disability) among stroke patients treated with rt-PA who are randomized to also receive either low-dose Argatroban, high-dose Argatroban or neither.
