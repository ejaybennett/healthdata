(secondQuint)Performance of AclarusDx, a Blood-Based Transcriptomic Test for AD, in US Patients Newly Referred to a Memory Center.

 The objective of this study is to apply AclarusDx cent signature in a reference US Center in 160 patients newly referred to one of the three study centers within the Cleveland Clinic, Center for Brain Health network, for diagnostic workup.

 Only AclarusDx cent will be added to the panel of tests usually performed at the centers to establish diagnosis.

 AclarusDx cent will be used for investigational use only, not for diagnostic purpose.

 The ultimate goal is to define the clinical utility of AclarusDx cent to provide Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) with a tool that will help them in making the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

 The primary objectives are : 1.

 To obtain an estimate of the capability of AclarusDx cent to identify AD patients among a US-based population of newly referred patients suffering from objective memory impairment which maybe potentially related to multiple and different etiologies.

 2.

 To compare the performance of AclarusDx cent in a US-based population of newly referred patients with memory impairment with the performance of AclarusDx cent observed in one comparable European population.

The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of AclarusDx cent , an investigational blood test detecting gene expression information, and intended to help physicians in making an Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis in patients having memory impairments.
