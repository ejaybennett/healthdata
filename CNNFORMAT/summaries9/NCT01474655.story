(secondQuint)Retinal Layers and Visual Rehabilitation After Epiretinal Membrane Removal.

 Eyes with idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane Removal (ERM) scheduled to underwent ERM removal were included.

 Changes in visual acuity, metamorphopsia score (M-score) using M-chart, and parafoveal thickness of each retinal layer were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-month and 6-month postoperative follow-up visits.

 Factors associated with visual acuity and M-score were investigated.
