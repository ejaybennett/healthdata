(secondQuint)Step Down Colon Cancer Risk.

 Primary Aim: To conduct a dose response pilot trial of low (30 min/day) or high (60 min/day) dose exercise in men and women at increased risk of colon cancer.

 The major outcomes are changes in serum levels of four risk-related biomarkers: insulin, C-peptide, IL-6 and PGE-2.

 Secondary Aim.

 To compare changes in the secondary outcome of physical activity over three months.

Hypothesis 1: Exercise will decrease serum markers in a dose response manner.

 Hypothesis 2: Participants in the 60 minute intervention will have significantly higher physical activity levels than those in the 30 minute intervention at three months.
