(thirdQuint)Freeze-Dried Black Raspberries in Preventing Oral Cancer Recurrence in High-Risk Appalachian Patients Previously Treated With Surgery For Oral Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To conduct an initial clinical study utilizing a high risk and underserved Appalachian population who are former oral cancer patients to determine the practicability of long-term daily lyophilized black raspberry (LBR) (LBR lozenge) administration and to gain insights into the potential prevention of recurrent oral cancer by LBR.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Evaluate numerous parameters (recruitment, tolerability, adherence to study guidelines, collection of biological samples, and demographics) that will be helpful in designing a future definitive, randomized, Phase II or III clinical trial structured to assess the potential effects of long-term LBR administration.

 II.

 Evaluate the temporal modulation of LBR-responsive gene expression that favor oral cancer chemoprevention in "at risk" normal tissues before, during and after LBR administration.

 III.

 Assess the temporal modulation of LBR-responsive gene expression and biological levels of fruit components in post-surgical oral cancer patients not exposed to LBR.

 OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberry lozenges orally (PO) 4 times daily (QID) for 6 months.

 ARM II: Patients do not receive lyophilized black raspberries lozenges.

 After completion of study treatment, patients in Arm I are followed up for 5 years and patients in Arm II are followed up for up to 1 year.

 Freeze-Dried Black Raspberries in Preventing Oral Cancer Recurrence in High-Risk Appalachian Patients Previously Treated With Surgery For Oral Cancer@highlight

This pilot clinical trial studies freeze-dried black raspberries in preventing oral cancer recurrence in high-risk Appalachian patients previously treated with surgery for oral cancer.

 Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming.

 Giving freeze-dried black raspberries may prevent oral cancer from forming
