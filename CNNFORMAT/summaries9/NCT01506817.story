(fifthQuint)Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE)-MRI in Fibromyalgia.

 Systematic, diagnostic studies applying DCE-MRI have never been performed in patients with fibromyalgia.

 However, characteristic contrast-enhancement patterns different from those seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis have been observed in a small sample of fibromyalgia patients referred for DCE-MRI of the hands for differential diagnostic purposes at department of radiology, Frederiksberg Hospital.

 In these patients enhancement parameters indicative of vasodilatation and diffuse hyperperfusion involving subcutaneous tissues and muscles of the hands and fingers were found, whereas no synovial inflammation in joints or tendons could be demonstrated in the majority of these patients.

 Whether these observations are part of a "normal" physiological perfusion in healthy individual or a potential novel marker of disease activity remains to be studied.

 If a pathological imaging pattern indicative of superficial soft tissue or muscle inflammation/hyper perfusion can be demonstrated it will have far-reaching implications for future research related to this patient population.

 Not only may this line of research contribute to a better neurobiological understanding of fibromyalgia and the neurobiological link between inflammation and pain modulation, but also to the development of more objective examination methods, which will make diagnosing more reliable and less subjective.

 Further, a better understanding of the neurobiology and phenomenological manifestations of fibromyalgia may have critical treatment implications.

 Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE)-MRI in Fibromyalgia@highlight

The primary objective of the current pilot study is to analyze MRI contrast-enhancement patterns in the hands of patients with fibromyalgia as compared to the findings in healthy controls.

 Further, to compare enhancement patterns obtained in fibromyalgia patients with those described in inflammatory joint disorders, i.

 rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

 Hypothesis: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the hands in patients with fibromyalgia reveals pathological imaging patterns indicative of diffuse non-arthrogenic inflammation of e.

g.

 superficial soft tissues and /or muscle with patterns distinct from those of inflammatory joint disorders e.

g.

 rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
