(fifthQuint)Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Influenza Vaccine Pilot.

 This is a single center, open-label, mechanistic study designed to determine the variance of the antibody response in non-atopic and ADEH- participants receiving a single dose of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone(R) Intradermal vaccine administered per label.

 Twenty non-atopic and 20 ADEH- (mild to severe AD) adults aged 18 to 64 years will be enrolled.

 Enrollment will be closely monitored to ensure that there is a similar distribution of non-atopic and ADEH- participants by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

 Eligible study participants will provide a pre-vaccination blood sample (Day 0) for assessment of baseline HAI antibody titers, cellular immune response, total IgE, and allergen sensitization, and will then receive a single injection of the 2011-2012 seasonal Fluzone(R) Intradermal vaccine administered per label.

 A subset of participants will also provide blood for microarray analysis at Baseline (Day 0) and will return to the clinic 3 and 7 days post-vaccination to provide additional blood for microarray analysis.

 All participants will return to the study site 28 days post-vaccination for a blood draw for HAI antibody titers and cellular immune response assays.

 Study participants will be followed for safety, including serious adverse events (SAEs), throughout the entire duration of the study and will be asked to record solicited AEs on a diary card (Days 0-7).

 Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Influenza Vaccine Pilot@highlight

A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into the muscle has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population including patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

 This new vaccine has been shown to work as well as the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic dermatitis.

 The primary endpoint of the study is to estimate the variance of the log fold change from baseline in HAI antibody titers for non-atopic controls and participants with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), following administration of a single dose of the seasonal 2011-2012 Fluzone(R) Intradermal vaccine.
