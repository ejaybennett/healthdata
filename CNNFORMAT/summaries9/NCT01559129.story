(secondQuint)Study of Pomalidomide (CC-4047) to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Effectiveness for Subjects With Systemic Sclerosis With Interstitial Lung Disease.

 Based upon interim analysis data from the Phase 2 proof of concept study in subjects with systemic sclerosis with interstitial lung disease (CC-4047-SSC-001), the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) nor for improvement in the modified Rodnan skin score at 24 and 52 weeks, for subjects who had completed blinded treatment.

 In this study, pomalidomide was well tolerated with an adverse event profile comparable to the risk safety information known for pomalidomide in other diseases.

 Treatment has stopped, but patients will remain in follow up.
