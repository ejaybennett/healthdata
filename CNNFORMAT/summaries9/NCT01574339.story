(secondQuint)Effect of Long-Term Electrical Stimulation on LES Pressure and Esophageal Acid Exposure in Patients With GERD.

 EndoStim has developed an investigational medical device specifically designed to deliver electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using an external version of the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects.

 In these two short-term studies, electrical stimulation resulted in significant increases in LES pressure.

 This study will further evaluate the safety of the procedure and its feasibility for use in this group of patients.
