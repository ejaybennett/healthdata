(fifthQuint)Pazopanib in Second-line Therapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 Patients who progress or do not tolerate a first-line treatment with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor will be included consecutively in the study.

 All patients will receive the same treatment regimen consisting of 800 mg / day of pazopanib in monotherapy.

 All patients will receive treatment until there is evidence of progression, evidence of unacceptable toxicity, not compliance, investigator clinical decision or consent withdrawal by the patient.

 After treatment, the patient will enter to the follow-up period.

 During this period the investigator will collect information from subsequent administered treatments and survival of all patients, regardless of the reason for withdrawal, every 8 weeks until the scheduled end of follow-up period, according to protocol.

 At 30 days after treatment completion, the first follow up visit will be scheduled to assess the possible occurrence of late toxicity.

 In those patients who complete treatment prior to objectify progression, information about the progression of the disease will be collected.

 Pazopanib in Second-line Therapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma@highlight

The principal aim of the study is to determine the objective response rate that offers the second-line treatment with pazopanib in patients with carcinoma of advanced renal cells that have progressed or that have not tolerated the first line of treatment with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

 The secondary aims are to determine the overall survival and the treatment safety profile for these patients in second-line treatment with pazopanib.

 The exploratory aim is to determine the correlation between biomarkers in patient blood and tumor samples, and the clinical results obtained with pazopanib.
