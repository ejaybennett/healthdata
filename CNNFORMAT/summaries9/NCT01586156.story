(fifthQuint)PAHTCH Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treatment With Carvedilol for Heart Failure (Carvedilol).

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction leading to pulmonary vascular constriction, smooth muscle and endothelial proliferation, and progressive right-sided heart failure.

 The severity of pulmonary hypertension is mostly determined by the response of the right ventricle (RV) to the increased afterload or pulmonary pressures, and RV failure is the leading cause of death in PAH.

 Most accepted therapies for PAH have been aimed at vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature, and there has been little thought that PAH patients would benefit from traditional left heart failure treatments.

 A cornerstone therapy in left heart failure is ]-adrenergic receptor blockade because of its ability to reverse cardiac remodeling and improve clinical outcomes, despite decades of concern regarding its propensity to exacerbate heart failure.

 It has been reported to reduce mortality by about 30% in patients, and while the precise mechanisms that contribute to its beneficial effects remain to be elucidated, there is evidence that patients with underlying contractile reserve (i.

e.

, via recruitment of viable myocardium with ]-adrenergic receptor stimulation) may experience greater recovery of their cardiac function.

 In a study using rats with pulmonary hypertension treated with ] blocker, RV function improved, and maladaptive myocardial remodeling was prevented.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature leading to elevated pulmonary pressure and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with heart failure.

 Measures of RV function are better predictors of mortality and long term outcomes than pulmonary vascular resistance.

 The interaction between RV function and the pulmonary circulation is not fully understood, but increased after load appears insufficient to explain right heart failure.

 Yet, all approved PAH therapies target vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature to lower pressures
