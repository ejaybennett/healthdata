(fifthQuint)Tailored Tobacco Quitline for Rural Veterans.

 Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in our society.

 Results from epidemiologic studies indicate that tobacco use is especially elevated among those living in rural areas.

 Although interventions exist that are both effective and cost-effective, few rural smokers utilize them during any given quit attempt.

 A lack of local treatment resources, the travel distance required to obtain treatment, and a reduced tendency to visit primary care on a regular basis all appear to contribute to the lower levels of treatment for nicotine dependence in rural smokers.

 Smokers frequently experience conditions and concerns that adversely impact their ability to quit smoking.

 Depression and risky alcohol use, both of which are prevalent among smokers, reduce the likelihood of successfully quitting smoking.

 Concern about gaining weight, a common consequence of quitting smoking, is also frequently cited by smokers as an important barrier to quitting.

 Therefore, in order to be most effective, tobacco cessation interventions will need to address these important issues.

 Presently, treatment for nicotine dependence, risky alcohol use, depression, and weight management is typically delivered separately and without optimal integration among providers, an approach which only serves to fragment care and increase the number of required visits, further reduce rural smokers' access to care.

 In an effort to address these barriers, the current study will evaluate a telephone intervention for tobacco use that also addresses issues related to risky alcohol use, depressed mood, and postcessation weight gain based on each individual smoker's needs.

 Results will provide valuable information regarding the potential to more widely implement an individually-tailored telephone intervention for rural smokers.

The proposed work is designed to help increase access to tobacco cessation services among rural veterans and to develop more effective treatment services that better address comorbid issues commonly experienced by rural smokers.

 The objectives are: 1.

 Study the feasibility of an individually-tailored telephone intervention for rural smokers.

 2.

 Examine the impact of the intervention on tobacco use outcomes.

 3.

 Evaluate the effect of the intervention on issues commonly experienced by rural smokers including depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and weight gain.
