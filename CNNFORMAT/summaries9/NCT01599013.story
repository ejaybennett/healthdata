(fifthQuint)JAVLOR Association Study in CDDP-unfit Patients With Advanced Transitional Cell Carcinoma: Gemcitabine Versus Carboplatin.

 Gemcitabine and carboplatin have been the most studied and used anticancer agents in cisplatin-unfit patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

 Both agents previously demonstrated clinical activity as single agent and/or as part of combination regimen in patients with advanced or metastatic disease even if clinical benefits and survival remains limited in this setting for this population.

 The purpose of this study is to test in a randomized trial enrolling patients with renal impairment or moderate congestive heart failure two combinations of a novel cytotoxic agent, vinflunine, one with gemcitabine and another with carboplatin in order to determine the most promising combination in the first line treatment of advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

This study is assessing the combination of well known cytotoxics with a novel anti-cancer agent that could be administered as monotherapy without renal toxicity in patients with renal impairment presenting with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma previously treated with a platinum-based regimen.

 The intent of this study is to clarify the benefit/risk ratio of the two most promising associations of cytotoxics including the novel therapeutic agent, vinflunine: vinflunine-gemcitabine and vinflunine-carboplatin.
