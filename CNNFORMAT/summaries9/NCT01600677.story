(thirdQuint)Determining the Impact of a Medication Delivery Unit on Medication Adherence of Adults With Common Cardiac Conditions.

 Care transition interventions have been successful in reducing medication-related problems and associated rehospitalization primarily by focusing on medication reconciliation conducted by trained healthcare professionals.

 Programs to improve the medication reconciliation process have largely been effective but have limitations, including: the expenses associated with recruiting, training, and retaining care transition healthcare professionals; the ability to provide services within a finite geographic area; and the retrospective nature of the reconciliation process, which usually occurs in the home following hospital discharge.

 Our short-term objective is to determine the impact of the INRange Systems Electronic Medication Management Assistant (EMMA) medication delivery unit (MDU) for adults that require medication assistance in their home immediately following an acute hospitalization with a diagnosis of a common cardiac condition.

 As part of this study, we will determine: (1) Medication adherence rates (# doses/doses scheduled; EMMA (intervention) vs.

 determined by manual monthly pill counts at days 1, 45 and 90 (control)); (2) Health service utilization; (3) Health economic assessment from health plan and societal perspectives; (4) Medication administration errors; (5) Patient experience and satisfaction; (6) Medication reconciliation errors (using medication discrepancy tool); (7) 30-day readmission rates; and (8) Factors related to continued use of the EMMA MDU.

 Study Overview and Design: The research study design associated with this proposal is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

 The primary endpoint is to compare medication adherence of adult patients recently hospitalized with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure who require medication assistance either by receiving usual care (i.

e.

, the control group; take medications as they had before hospitalization) or by using a medication delivery unit (i.

e.

, the intervention group; take medications only from the device, which will always differ from the usual way in which medications were taken prior to hospitalization).

 Study duration: The overall study will last a total of 12 months.

 Each subject will be enrolled for a period of 90 days regardless of unit of randomization (i.

e.

, control/usual care vs.

 intervention).

 Subject Recruitment: One-hundred and sixty patients > 18 years old who are admitted to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital will be considered as potential study participants.

 Records of these patients will be pre-screened within 24 hours of admittance using inclusion and exclusion criteria that can be assessed without direct patient contact.

 Participants who pass the initial/exclusion criteria will be visited by the Research Assistant following agreement by the patient's attending physician.

 The Research Assistant will introduce the goals and design of the study, take informed consent, and complete the remaining exclusion instruments, MMSE, CAM, the test of the medication delivery unit interface, and questions regarding subjects' travel and hospice plans.

 Detailed Description of Research Activities to be Performed: Following administrative medical record review by the UPMC Case Manager for review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a potential subject's attending physician will be contacted to review the patient's study eligibility.

 If the attending is in agreement with the information collected by the UPMC Health Plan Case Manager, the patient will be eligible to be consented by the Research Assistant.

 The Research Assistant will then approach the patient to explain the entire research project and obtain written and oral informed consent.

 Once informed consent is obtained, an enrollment questionnaire will be completed, which consists of the following components: 1) Medication adherence using the MMAS-4 (Morisky 4-Item Self-Report Measure of Medication-Taking Behavior) and CRN-2 (Cost-related non-adherence); 2) Cognitive status assessment using the MMSE; 3) Delirium assessment using the CAM; 4) EMMA Medication Delivery Unit proficiency testing; 5) Demographics and appointment scheduling.

 If the patient does not meet any of the additional exclusion criteria contained within the enrollment questionnaire, the patient will be considered to be enrolled in the study.

 Randomization process: Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will randomized based on the number of medications that are prescribed: > 5 medications (polypharmacy group) or /= 2 missed doses of the same medication.

 During the course of the study, if a new medication is needed, RxPartners will be responsible for blister-packing the medication (in the intervention group) or dispensing in traditional pill bottles, and either couriering it to the patient within 6 hours or delivering non-urgent medications through overnight-mail.
