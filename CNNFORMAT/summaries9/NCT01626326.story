(fifthQuint)San Francisco Stop Smoking App - Pilot Study.

 The investigators research team has developed smoking cessation self-help tools administered as printed brochures and Internet stop smoking sites.

 These self-help tools have demonstrated quit rates similar to those obtained with the nicotine patch.

 The investigators now want to see if mobile device apps might also help people quit.

 This is the investigators first pilot study with a research version of the investigators stop smoking app for the iPhone.

 The investigators want to get estimates of how many people will download the app per month, how many will actually use the app, and how many will provide follow-up information on whether they quit, and if not, how many cigarettes they are smoking now.

 The investigators will use this information to plan a randomized controlled trial to determine efficacy of the app for stopping smoking.
