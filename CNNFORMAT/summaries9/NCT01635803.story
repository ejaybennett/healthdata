(secondQuint)Comparing the Effectiveness and Costs of Bevacizumab to Ranibizumab in Patients With Retinal Vein Occlusions (BRVO).

 Objective: to compare the effectiveness and costs of 1.

25 mg bevacizumab to 0.

5 mg ranibizumab, given as monthly intravitreal injections during 6 months.

 Study Design: This will be a randomized, controlled, double masked, clinical trial in 296 patients in 7 academic trial centres in The Netherlands.

 Study population: patients older than 18 years of age with macular edema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion and a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score between 78 and 20 letters in the study eye.

 Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be the change in BCVA in the study eye from baseline to month 6.

 Secondary outcomes will be amongst others the proportion of patients with a gain of 15 letters or more and/or a BCVA of 20/40 or more at 6 months and the costs per quality adjusted life-year of the two treatments.

 Comparing the Effectiveness and Costs of Bevacizumab to Ranibizumab in Patients With Retinal Vein Occlusions (BRVO)@highlight

The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with macular edema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion (branch or central) as determined by the change in best-corrected visual acuity in the study eye from baseline to month 6.
