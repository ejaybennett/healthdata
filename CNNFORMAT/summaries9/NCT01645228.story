(firstQuint)Could Non-invasive Biochemical, Image or Physiological Index Predict Significant Coronary Arterial Stenosis in Symptomatic Adults?.

 The main objective is to validate the capability of these non-invasive tests (CCS, hs-CRP and ABI) in prediction of significant coronary stenosis of symptomatic adults.

 The end-point will be the findings of coronary CT angiography.

 The investigators hope the results of our study could be applied on the interpretation of health examination and the advice of follow-up and therapy.
