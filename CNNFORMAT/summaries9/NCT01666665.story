(fifthQuint)Mechanisms of Improved Wound Healing and Protein Synthesis of Insulin and Metformin.

 Metformin treated patients will be compared to control patients.

 Both groups will receive insulin therapy for blood glucose >180mg/dl.

 Insulin will be titrated according to hospital sliding scale.

 The use of insulin or metformin will benefit burned children by improving muscle protein build-up, speeding wound healing and reversing growth arrest, improving the immune response, and positively affecting long-term rehabilitation.

 The results of this study may initiate a change in standard of care as it is found that simply the reduction of blood glucose by metformin, improves patient outcomes as metformin can be administered without the added complication of hypoglycemia.

 Mechanisms of Improved Wound Healing and Protein Synthesis of Insulin and Metformin@highlight

Massive pediatric burns are associated with a persistent and sustained hypermetabolic response characterized by elevated levels of circulating catecholamine's, cortisol, and glucagon's, which can cause extreme muscle wasting, immunodeficiency, and delay in wound healing.

 Insulin and metformin have demonstrated anabolic activity with minimal associated side effects.

 However, it is unknown whether the beneficial effects arise from tight euglycemic control or direct effect of insulin action.

 We hypothesize that during acute hospitalization, administration of metformin at a dose titrated to maintain blood glucose between 80-180 mg/dl will accelerate wound healing and recovery in children with severe thermal injury and will have beneficial long-term effects on muscle strength, immune function, and wound healing.
