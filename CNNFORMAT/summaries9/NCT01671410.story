(thirdQuint)Buprenorphine for Treatment of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome in Infants With In Utero Exposure to Benzodiazepines.

 Infants with in utero exposure to opioids often require therapy with morphine for an extended period.

 In a clinical trial, sublingual buprenorphine reduced this treatment period by ~30%.

 However, infants with both opioid and benzodiazepine exposure were not included in the trial.

 This study will test the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in infants with in utero exposure to benzodiazepines or who are breastfeeding.

 Buprenorphine for Treatment of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome in Infants With In Utero Exposure to Benzodiazepines@highlight

The opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a condition of withdrawal symptoms after utero exposure to opioids.

 Sublingual buprenorphine shows promise as a new treatment in NAS.

 This trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in infants exposed to both opioids and benzodiazepines in utero or with exposure of opioids in those who are breastfeeding.
