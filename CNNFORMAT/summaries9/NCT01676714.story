(secondQuint)Study of Dovitinib and Biomarkers in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or Advanced Colorectal Cancer.

 The purposes of this study are 1) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of dovitinib and 2) to prospectively estimate the prevalence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling alterations in patients with advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced CRC who have progressed on anti-VEGF treatment.

 Additionally, the investigators will make exploratory initial observations of the relationship between FGF signaling alterations and the clinical activity of dovitinib.

 This trial is expected to provide key biologic information that will inform the clinical development of dovitinib and provide initial evaluation of the analytic characteristics of these potential predictive biomarkers of its efficacy.
