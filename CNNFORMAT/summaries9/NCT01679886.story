(fifthQuint)Comparison of Rubidium PET and SPECT With CZT Crystals for Detection of Myocardial Ischemia in Overweighed Patients and Women.

 The main objective of this study will be to compare the diagnostic performances of 82Rubidium-PET associated to pharmacologic stress (Persantine) to 99mTc-Sestamibi-SPECT with CZT cameras associated to a stress test (exercise, pharmacological, mixed) for detection of myocardial ischemia in a population of overweighed patients on one hand, and women on the other hand, in a population with an intermediate prevalence of coronary artery disease ( 3 cardiovascular risk factors in asymptomatic patients or prevalence of CAD 30 % using the DIAMOND-FORRESTER score in symptomatic patients).

 Secondary objectives.

 (1) Comparison between the size and intensity of myocardial ischemia quantified using the sum difference score, left ventricular function at stress and at rest, measured with 99mTc-Sestamibi-SPECT with CZT cameras and 82Rubidium-PET.

 (2) Comparison between the values of coronary fractional flow reserve measured invasively and noninvasively with 82Rubidium-PET in patients with stenosis 50 % on coronary angiography.

 (3) Comparison of the effective dose caused by radiation exposure with 99mTc-Sestamibi-SPECT with CZT cameras and 82Rubidium-PET.

 (4) Comparison of the costs of the two diagnostic strategies in this population of patients.

 Inclusion criteria: Overweighed (body mass index 25) or women addressed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine for diagnostic cardiac scintigraphy with an intermediate pre-test prevalence of CAD ( 3 cardiovascular risk factors in asymptomatic patients or prevalence of CAD 30 % using the DIAMOND-FORRESTER score in symptomatic patients).

 Non-inclusion criteria: Pregnant women; contraindication to dipyridamole injection.

 Number of patients: 310 patients Duration of the study.

 Duration of the study for a patient will be 16 months and 28 months for the first patients.

 Total duration of the study will be 40 months, including an 24-month inclusion time period.

 Primary endpoint: Patients will be classified as positive in case of: - Myocardial ischemia defined as the presence of coronary stenosis 50 % on coronary angiography with functional impairment of blood flow confirmed by invasive measurement of coronary flow reserve (fractional flow reserve, FFR 50 % on coronary angiography.

 (3) Effective dose caused by radiation exposure with 99mTc-Sestamibi-SPECT with CZT cameras and 82Rubidium-PET.

 (4) Costs of the two diagnostic strategies in this population of patients.
