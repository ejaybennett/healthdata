(secondQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety Study of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Combined Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) Vaccine in Children in Their Second Year of Life.

 This trial is a Phase IIIA, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, multi-center, multi-country study with four parallel groups.

 This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' trivalent investigational MMR vaccine (referred to as Inv_MMR vaccine, throughout this document) in contrast to the US standard of care comparator vaccine (M M R(R)II, Merck and Co.

, Inc.

, referred to as Com_MMR throughout this document) in children during their second year of life.

 The first dose of this two-dose study is designed to establish the end of shelf-life potency of Inv_MMR vaccine.

 The Inv_MMR vaccine will be given as one of two lots; one of a minimum potency, designated Inv_MMR_Min; and the other at a mid-range or medium potency designated Inv_MMR_Med to two groups.

 The second dose for both of these Inv_MMR groups will have a potency within the release range of the marketed vaccine.

 The Com_MMR vaccine will consist of two lots designated Com_MMR_L1 and Com_MMR_L2 and will be analyzed as pooled lots within the study.

 The first MMR vaccine dose will be co-administered with Varivax, Havrix and (in the US sub-cohort only) Prevnar 13 which are routinely administered to children of this age in the US.
