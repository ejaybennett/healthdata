(secondQuint)Povidone Iodine and Cesarean Section Wound Infections.

 For centuries, hand washing with soap and water has been considered the main approach for personal hygiene.

 In the community, hand hygiene has been known to prevent infectious diseases and to decrease the burden of disease.

 Currently, hand hygiene is considered the most important measure for preventing the spread of pathogens in health-care settings.

 There are multiple agents used for surgical hand scrubbing as alcohol, chlorhexidine, iodine/iodophors, para-chloro-meta-xylenol & triclosan.

 Ideally, the optimum antiseptic used for scrub should have broad spectrum of activity, persistent effect & fast acting.

 Unfortunately most studies evaluating surgical scrub antiseptics have focused on measuring hand bacterial colony counts.

 No randomized clinical trials have evaluated the impact of surgical scrub choice on surgical site infection risk & proven its efficiency.
