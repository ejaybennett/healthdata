(firstQuint)The Effect of Administration of Low Dose Adrenaline During Surgery on Bleeding During Hip Surgery.

 Hip arthroplasty is associated with bleeding, anemia and the need for allogeneic transfusion.

 Administration of low-dose adrenaline activates the coagulation system and may decrease intraoperative and immediate postoperative bleeding.

 Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluation whether intraoperative IV-administration of low-dose adrenaline reduces bleeding in elective total hip arthroplasty.
