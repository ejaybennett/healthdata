(firstQuint)Reolysin in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Standard Salvage Therapy.

 Reolysin is a virus which has been shown to target and destroy cancer cells in laboratory tests.

 Reolysin has been studied in over 360 cancer patients to find safe doses that can be given and has also undergone testing in combination with docetaxel.

 Docetaxel and pemetrexed have anticancer activity in certain cancers including lung and they have been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given together with docetaxel or pemetrexed.

The purpose of this study is to find out if giving reolysin in combination with docetaxel or pemetrexed can offer better results than standard therapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed alone.
