(firstQuint)Diffusion Tensor Imaging to Assess the Functional Outcomes of Adults With Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries.

 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters will correlate with severity of spinal cord injury in SCI patients as seen in rodent models.

 We will test whether the quantitative decrease in axial () diffusivity (a biomarker of axonal injury), will predict long-term functional outcomes for patients with a SCI.

 Specific Aim: To examine patients after an acute SCI using DTI and to correlate the extent of acute decrease in with the presenting ASIA motor score and long-term functional outcome of the patient.

Acute changes in axial diffusivity will correlate with the severity of injury in patients that suffer an acute spinal cord injury.
