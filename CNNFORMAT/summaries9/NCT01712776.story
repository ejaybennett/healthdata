 This study design is considered standard for establishing safety and efficacy data.

 Active treatment vapocoolant spray (Pain Ease Medium Stream) spray) will be used.

 There will be a placebo (sterile water) in this study.

 The population selected for this study, adults (excluding the very old, > 80 years old) represents a patient population that may benefit from vapocoolant spray.

 This is a patient population that according to the treating health care provider already requires venipuncture for "blood draw" but not intravenous cannulation.

 Because venipuncture is a painful procedure, vapocoolant may confer benefit for the relief of pain.
