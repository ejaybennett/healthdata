(secondQuint)Collaborative Targeted Case Management in Improving Functional Status in Patients With Stage III-IV Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Establish the comparative effectiveness of the Collaborative Care to Preserve Performance in Cancer (COPE) trial arms in preserving functional status.

 II.

 To assess the comparative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the COPE interventions.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

 ARM I: Patients undergo enhanced usual care comprising telephonic monitoring, monthly status reports, and an oncology care team for 6 months.

 ARM II: Patients undergo enhanced usual care as in Arm I and participate in an individualized conditioning program delivered by a local physical therapist and coordinated by the Rehabilitation Care Manager (RCM) for 6 months.

 ARM III: Patients undergo enhanced usual care as in Arm I, participate in an individualized conditioning program coordinated by the RCM as in Arm II, and receive optimized pain management through a Pain Care Manager (PCM) for 6 months.
