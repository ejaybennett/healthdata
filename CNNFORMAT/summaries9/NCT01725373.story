(secondQuint)Angioplasty of Left Main - lAriboisiere Registry.

 Current guidelines recommend coronary artery bypass graft surgery as the "gold standard" treatment in patients with unprotected left main disease.

 However, patients with ULMD and high surgical risk score or favourable anatomy are still referred for angioplasty.

 Recently, several studies and registries comparing surgery and percutaneous intervention with drug eluting stents report similar results regarding cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease including unprotected left main disease.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate major cardiovascular events in a "real world" registry.

In patients with unprotected left main disease (ULMD), angioplasty is emerging as an alternative technique.

 The investigators aimed to determine the rate of major cardiovascular events in patients treated by angioplasty for ULMD in a "real world" registry.
