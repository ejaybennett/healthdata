(thirdQuint)Educational Intervention to Reduce Drug-related Hospitalizations in Elderly Primary Health Care Patients.

 Inappropriate medication in the elderly patient leads to substantial morbidity, possibly causing up to 20% of hospitalizations in this patient group (1).

 To improve prescribing and thus reduce undesired drug effects is a great challenge for doctors and nurses in primary health care.

 Performance of drug utilization reviews is recommended in order to reduce the negative impact of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly.

 However, scientific evidence on their efficacy is lacking, especially regarding patient-related health outcomes (2,3).

 Most studies are carried out in inpatient care, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding primary health care (2).

 Moreover, studies in this scientific field diverge regarding the content and structure of drug utilization reviews, which implies that comparison between studies becomes challenging, if not impossible.

 This trial aims at educating health care providers in how to perform drug utilization reviews, and to help them implement theory into practice.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether an educational intervention given towards health care providers working in primary health care centers can reduce inappropriate prescribing in the elderly patient and thus reduce number and length of drug-related hospitalizations as well as number of emergency department visits in this patient group.
