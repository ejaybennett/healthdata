(secondQuint)Phase III Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta.

 This randomized, double-blind trial compared the proposed biosimilar LA-EP2006 with the reference Neulasta(R) in women (18 years) receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.

 Therefore patients were randomized to receive LA-EP2006 (n = 159) or the reference product (n = 157) for 6 cycles of (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel 75mg/m^2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m^2, and cyclophosphamide 500mg/m^2) chemotherapy.

 The primary end point was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during Cycle 1 (defined as number of consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count 1 day margin.

 LA-EP2006 was equivalent to the reference product in DSN (difference: 0.

07 days; 95% CI [-0.

12, 0.

26]).

 Further, LA-EP2006 and the reference Neulasta(R) showed no clinically meaningful differences regarding efficacy and safety.

 Phase III Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of LA-EP2006 and Neulasta@highlight

The study will assess the efficacy of LA-EP2006 compared to Neulasta(R) with respect to the mean duration of severe neutropenia during treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
