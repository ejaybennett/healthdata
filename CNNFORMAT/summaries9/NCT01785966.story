(fifthQuint)Checklist During Multidisciplinary Visits for Reduction of Mortality in Intensive Care Units.

 Cluster randomized trial involving ICUs in Brazil.

 ICU is the unit of randomization.

 The trial will have two stages: - Stage I - Baseline data.

In this stage we will: - Apply "Safety Attitudes Questionnaire" for the employees of the participating ICU.

 - Characterize participant ICUs in terms of the standards (RDC n7/2010, RDC n26/2012 e RDC n 63/2011) for intensive care units proposed by the Brazilian National Health Agency (ANVISA) - Characterize patients: we will collect data from 60 consecutive critically ill patients from each participant ICU to describe adherence to measures aimed at avoiding ICU complications and clinical outcome measures.

 - Stage II - Intervention: This is the main stage for data analysis.

 ICUs will be randomly assigned to an experimental or control group.

 The experimental group should use a multi-item verbal checklist including assessment of daily goals during the multidisciplinary visits plus clinician prompting.

 We will collect data from 60 additional patients for each ICU in both study groups and apply "Safety Attitudes Questionnaire".

 Checklist During Multidisciplinary Visits for Reduction of Mortality in Intensive Care Units@highlight

CHECKLIST-ICU will be a cluster randomized trial to ascertain whether the use of an intervention including 1) checklists with assessment of daily goals during the multidisciplinary visit, and 2) clinician prompting can reduce in-hospital mortality of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).

 The investigators also aim to describe participant ICUs in terms of the standards for intensive care units proposed by the Brazilian National Health Agency (ANVISA).
