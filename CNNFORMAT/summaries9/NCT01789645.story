(fifthQuint)Physical Therapy in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

 Scientific evidence for the management of CTS has exhibited conflicting results.

 The Cochrane review concluded that surgical treatment relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting but further research is needed.

 A systematic review focused on physical therapy for the management of CTS included 6 studies and found weak to strong effect of neural gliding exercises.

 Recent studies have revealed complex nociceptive mechanisms involved in CTS which should be carefully considered during the management of these patients.

 Proper physical therapy interventions can modulate nociceptive processes found in CTS.

 We will perform a randomized clinical trial nested within a prospective cohort as our study design to determine if proper physical therapy approach targeted to modulate sensitization processes is equally effective than surgical intervention for improving pain and function in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

 Physical Therapy in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome@highlight

It is a randomized clinical trial comparing surgical and conservative (physical therapy) treatments for women with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

 The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of physical therapy versus endoscopic surgery in pain and disability in women with carpal tunnel syndrome at medium and long-term follow-up periods.

 We hypothesized that proper physical therapy approach can be equally effective than surgical intervention for improving pain and function in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.
