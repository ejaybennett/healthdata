(fifthQuint)Withania Somnifera: an Immunomodulator and Anti-inflammatory Agent for Schizophrenia.

 The primary aim is to determine whether a standardized extract of Withania somnifera will reduce psychopathology scores (PANSS total) and stress scores(PSS total) in persons with schizophrenia? The study will also determine whether WSE reduces measures of positive and negative and general symptoms of schizophrenia (PANSS subscale scores)? Another primary aim will be to determine if changes in antipsychotic and/or other psychotropic medications (lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, anxiolytic agents or hypnotics) (examples: dosage escalation or reductions or switch or stoppage) will favor the group receiving the standardized Withania somnifera extract versus those receiving placebo.

 Even though we expect changes in antipsychotic medications to occur when patients experience an exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (or other psychiatric symptoms), we hypothesize that those receiving the standardized Withania somnifera extract will experience fewer medication adjustments then those assigned to placebo.

 A secondary aim is to determine whether WSE will rebalance TH1/TH2 ratios (cytokine measures) and mediate a reduction of elevated hs-CRP levels? The study will assess whether those subjects whose TH1/TH2 ratios normalize have a greater magnitude of clinical improvement vs.

 those subjects whose immune ratios remain unbalanced.

 Similarly, the study will assess whether reduction of hsCRP levels correlate with improvements in PANSS total and subscale scores or the PSS total scores.

 Eighty or more patients with DSM IV TR (or if instituted by the study initiation: DSM V) schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be screened and 60 or more eligible patients will be enrolled in a 12 week placebo controlled double blind study.

 Subjects who have experienced an exacerbation of positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, etc).

 Subjects receiving medications that affect the immune-inflammatory system will be excluded and those receiving antibiotics, antiviral or anti-parasitic medications will be excluded.

 Base line laboratory and EKG examination will be carried out to establish eligibility for study participation.

 In addition specific laboratory analyses of immune markers namely interleukin-2, interferon gamma, interleukin-4, interleukin 6 and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein will be carried out.

 Sixty or more patients will be randomly assigned to receive either WSE or matching placebo starting with 1 capsule of 250 mg strength twice a day (total daily dose = 500 mg) for the first week which will be increased to 2 capsules of 250 mg twice daily (total daily dose = 1000 mg) for a total treatment period of 12 weeks.

 An assessment of psychopathology (PANSS) and stress will be carried out at each scheduled visit.

 Assessments of safety including vital signs and treatment emergent adverse events will also be carried out at each visit.

 Immune-inflammatory markers will be re-assessed at the final visit.

 Withania Somnifera: an Immunomodulator and Anti-inflammatory Agent for Schizophrenia@highlight

Withania somnifera (WSE; Ashwagandha in Ayurveda) extracts have been used as an adaptogen or to build resistance to stress or diseases in indigenous medical systems in India for centuries.

 Modern scientific data for WSE indicate several bioactive molecules (withanolides, withanosides, indosides, withaferin-A, others) with significant immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and stress reducing properties.

 This study will examine whether a standardized extract of Withania Somnifera (WSE; Sensoril(R)) will improve total, positive, negative symptoms, and stress in patients with schizophrenia.

 The study will examine whether WSE reduces PANSS positive and negative symptoms and stress scores in subjects, and whether these improvements are mediated by changes in inflammatory immune indices.

 An additional aim will determine if patients receiving WSE will have fewer adjustments to their psychotropic medications that those assigned to placebo.

 The study will examine whether WSE will re-balance Th1/Th2 ratios (cytokine measures) and mediate a reduction of elevated hs-CRP levels.

 It is hypothesized that those subjects whose Th1/Th2 ratios normalize will likely have a greater magnitude of clinical improvement versus those subjects whose immune ratios remain unbalanced.

 The proposal is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of WSE added to antipsychotic medications in approximately 60 or more patients with schizophrenia with an exacerbation of symptoms.

 If efficacy is affirmed, this low cost extract could be studied further, and used quite readily across low, middle and high income countries.
