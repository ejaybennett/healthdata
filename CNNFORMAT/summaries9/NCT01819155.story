(fifthQuint)Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of Adjuvanted and Non-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine in Tropical Africa.

 The is a phase 2b, single-center, randomized, observer-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial of the immunogenicity and safety of adjTIV and seasonal TIV among healthy children aged 6 months through 71 months in the town of Niakhar, Senegal.

 A total of 300 healthy children will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio of adjTIV to TIV to placebo.

 Each child will receive two doses of one of the three study vaccines, with each dose given 28 days apart.

 Each child will be followed closely for safety after each dose for the period from one month post-dose two to 3 months post-dose two.

 For determination of immune response to vaccination or background influenza infection, 3 mL of blood will be obtained at three time points: pre-vaccination, 28 days post-dose one (prior to receipt of dose two), and at 28 days post-dose two.

 Serum anti-influenza antibodies produced against virus strains contained in the vaccine will be detected using hemagglutination inhibition assay.

 Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of Adjuvanted and Non-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine in Tropical Africa@highlight

This study will provide the Senegal Ministry of Health with data on the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (adjTIV) and full-dose seasonal non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children.

 This data will inform future policy considerations for influenza vaccine.

 The study is not powered to detect significant differences between vaccines or groups, and no hypotheses are to be tested; therefore, immunogenicity and safety objectives are to be analyzed descriptively.
