(firstQuint)Xylitol Disk Use in Adults With Dry Mouth.

 Xylitol,an FDA approved sugar substitute, has been shown to reduce tooth decay.

 Patients who experience dry mouth may be more susceptible to dental decay because they lack the protection provided by an adequate flow of saliva.

 These patients are likely to have high levels of the decay causing bacteria, mutans streptococci.

 The purpose of this research is to test the ability of a novel xylitol delivery vehicle to reduce mutans streptococci in patients with dry mouth over a two week period.

 The delivery vehicle is a slowly dissolving xylitol disk (lozenge) that adheres to soft tissues inside the mouth.

 Participants will place disks on both sides of the mouth three times a day.
