(thirdQuint)Anesthetic Topical Adhesive (Synera) to Reduce Injection Pain With Subcutaneous Multiple Sclerosis Medications.

 Open-label prospective study of Synera to reduce injection pain in 30 patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis taking interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.

 The duration will be 3-6 weeks (1-2 weeks of baseline observation followed by 2-4 weeks of on-drug observation), depending on which Multiple Sclerosis drug product is being studied.

 The study will include down-titration from 60 to 30 minutes of application to assess for any difference in responses.

 We define one primary outcome measure,"pain upon injection" by visual analog scale (VAS).

 Secondary measures will include 24-hour ratings of pain by VAS and 24-hour local injection site reaction (LISR) scale score.

The purpose of this study is to see if applying an anesthetic topical adhesive, Synera(R), will reduce the injection pain.

 Relieving injection site pain may improve the tolerability of Multiple Sclerosis medications.

 Study Hypothesis: Pre-medication with Synera will have a significant effect on pain ratings as measured by the visual analog scale and Local injection site reaction scale.
