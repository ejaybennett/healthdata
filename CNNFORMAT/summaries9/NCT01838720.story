(secondQuint)Zero Ischemia Laparoscopic Radio Frequency Ablation Assisted Enucleation of Renal Cell Carcinoma With T1a Stage.

 Warm ischemic injury is one of the most important factors affecting renal function in partial nephrectomy (PN).

 Zero ischemia partial nephrectomy technique using renal arterial branch microdissection could protect renal function during surgery, but it requires longer operative time and more blood loss than conventional partial nephrectomy.

 The technique of zero ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted enucleation of renal cell carcinoma appears to be an alternative that eliminates warm ischemia, preserves the maximal parenchyma and is oncologically safe.

 Our study was designed to evaluate this technique in comparison with the conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
