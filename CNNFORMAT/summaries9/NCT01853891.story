(fifthQuint)Dim Light at Night in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

 The primary objective of this study is to determine whether sleeping with dLAN (40 lux) for 5 consecutive nights will result in increased markers of inflammation compared to sleeping in darkness (< 1 lux) during the night in patients with OSA.

 A secondary aim is to examine the effects on insulin sensitivity, adipokines, and RNA molecules.

 The risks associated with this study are minimal compared to the potential benefits.

 Knowledge about the effects of sleeping with dim light on inflammation in patients with OSA is important and would guide future recommendations about proper sleep hygiene.

 This research may also guide future recommendations about light conditions in other environments such as hospital bedrooms.

 Dim Light at Night in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea@highlight

With the advent of electricity, light at night has become a ubiquitous part of our society.

 The main purpose of this study is to determine whether sleeping with dim light (40 lux), the brightness of a night light) in your bedroom for 5 consecutive nights will result in increased markers of inflammation in the blood compared to sleeping in darkness during the night in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

 A secondary aim is to examine the effects on insulin sensitivity, other blood proteins, and RNA molecules as a result of sleeping with dim light.

 RNA molecules are substances in blood that dictate what type of proteins the body should make.
