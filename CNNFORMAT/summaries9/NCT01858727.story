(fifthQuint)The Effect of Preoperative Warming on Postoperative Hypothermia.

 The aim of our study is to evaluate the preoperative forced-air warming to prevent perioperative and postoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) surgery under general anaesthesia.

 The investigators plan to enroll 30 patients in 2 groups.

 Body temperature will be measured at the tympanic membrane and skin.

 Shivering will be graded by visual inspection.

The investigators hypothesize will decrease the forced air warming incidence of perioperative and postoperative hypothermia.

 The Effect of Preoperative Warming on Postoperative Hypothermia@highlight

30 patients American society of anesthesiology (ASA) physical status I,II and III undergoing general anesthesia for elective transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) surgery will be included in the study.

 Patients will be randomized into two groups; first group(control group) and second group (forced-air warming).

 Resistive heating will start when patients are transferred to the operating room table; forced-air warming will start before preoperative 30 minute.
