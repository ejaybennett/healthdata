(secondQuint)Effect of Pregabalin in Patients With Radiotherapy-related Neuropathic Pain.

 Radiotherapy for cancer is associated with peripheral neuropathies, especially with brachial plexus neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia, which included painful sensation that are described as burning, aching, spasm, or tingling.

 Though there is some recommendation about neuropathic pain, there is no definite drug which is recommended for radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.

 Pregabalin, a central nervous system(CNS)-active compound, is an analog of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid.

 It has been proved an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in previous clinical trials.

 This study plans to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo for relieving radiotherapy-related peripheral neuropathic pain, and assessed its safety.
