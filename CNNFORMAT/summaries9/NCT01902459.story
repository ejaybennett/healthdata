(thirdQuint)EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch Post-Market Study.

 This is a randomized, controlled single-center study observing the clinical utility of EVARREST cent against standard of care (SoC) in controlling soft tissue bleeding.

 Standard of care will be manual compression (MC) with or without a topical absorbable hemostat (TAH) or any other adjunctive hemostasis technique that is deemed by the surgeon to be his/her standard of care.

 All subjects will be followed post-operatively through discharge and at 30 (+/-14) days.

 Approximately 150 qualified subjects undergoing intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic and non-cardiac thoracic surgery requiring adjunctive support for hemostasis for soft tissue bleeding will be enrolled in the study.

 Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis, EVARREST cent vs.

 SoC.
