(secondQuint)Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Omalizumab Treatment on ICS Reduction for Severe IgE-mediated Asthma.

 This is a multicentric, open label, randomized, parallel-group study with a 12-month treatment period.

 Patients will be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups, omalizumab plus budesonide/formoterol or budesonide/formoterol alone.

 The study comprises 4 phases: During the 4-week run-in phase adult patients will receive budesonide 800 mg and formoterol 24 mg.

 If a patient complies with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and has been receiving the according-to-age run-in proposed doses during the last month, the patient may continue to the stable-steroid phase.

 During the 16-week stable-steroid phase, adult and pediatric eligible patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups.

 During the 8-week steroid-reduction phase, adult and pediatric patients will reduce 25% of the budesonide baseline dose every 2 weeks, depending of the asthma control, until reaching a 100% reduction of the baseline dose.

 The clinical control of asthma is defined according to criteria (GINA 2012).

 Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Omalizumab Treatment on ICS Reduction for Severe IgE-mediated Asthma@highlight

To assess efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment during 12 months in order to reduce the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in pediatric and adult patients with severe IgE-mediated asthma inadequately controlled with high doses of corticosteroids.
