(thirdQuint)Efficacy of Fixed Combination of Beclometasone + Formoterol + Glycopyrrolate Versus Foster in COPD.

 This 52-week randomised 2 parallel groups study aimed at evaluating the superiority of fixed triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA compared to ICS/LABA in severe to very severe COPD patients.

 Patients' eligibility was checked during the screening visit including the review of medical history, spirometry assessments, routine labs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs measurement.

 This visit was followed by a 2-week open-label run-in period under Foster(R) (BDP/FF 400/24 mu g total daily dose).

 Eligible patients were then randomised to either fixed triple therapy BDP/FF/GB or BDP/FF.

 During the 52-week treatment period, completing patients did have 5 subsequent visits post randomisation scheduled respectively after 4 (Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 26 (Visit 5), 40 (Visit 6) and 52 (Visit 7) weeks of treatment.

 During these, pre-dose and post-dose spirometry, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, dyspnea assessments were performed.

 Rescue medication use, compliance with the treatment and EXACT-PRO questionnaire were recorded daily (via an electronic diary) during the run-in and randomised treatment periods.
