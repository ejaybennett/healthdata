(firstQuint)Feasibility Study Assessing the Ability of an Insulin Pump-controlling Algorithm to Minimize Hypoglycemia.

 This study is a non-randomized, uncontrolled feasibility study that looks to enroll people with type 1 diabetes who are currently using an insulin pump.

 During the subject's participation, the study staff will closely monitor the study subject in a clinical research center environment for approximately 30 hours, while controller algorithm determined insulin doses are delivered by an insulin pump, and utilizing continuous glucose monitoring results.
