(secondQuint)Icotinib as Adjuvant Therapy in Treating Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients With Positive EGFR Mutation.

 Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating stage II-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer.

 However, few data on the treating time of adjuvant therapy is available.

 Here we conduct a randomized, prospective study to compare the recurrence-free survival after 1-year or 2-year treatment with icotinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients.
