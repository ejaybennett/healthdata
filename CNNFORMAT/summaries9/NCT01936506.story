(firstQuint)Cognitive Training for Depression.

 There is an urgent public health need to develop more effective and well tolerated treatments for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); cognitive training interventions aiming to modify cognitive and affective processing abnormalities underlying MDD represent a promising new strategy.

 This research project translates a well established cognitive bias in major depressive disorder (MDD), working memory bias, into a novel intervention target.

 In a double-blind, randomized, controlled study, MDD participants undergo 4 weeks of cognitive training sessions, with two sessions per week.
