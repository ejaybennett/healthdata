(firstQuint)Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Kovacaine Nasal Spray in Pediatric Subjects.

 The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of tetracaine, para- butylaminobenzoic acid (PBBA), and oxymetazoline after intranasal administration of the recommended, weight-based Phase 3 dose of Kovacaine Mist (Tetracaine Hydrochloride with Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride) to healthy pediatric subjects.

 Kovacaine Mist is an anesthetic solution containing 3% tetracaine hydrochloride and 0.

05% oxymetazoline hydrochloride.

 A single spray dose of 100 1/2L Kovacaine Mist contains 3 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.

05 mg oxymetazoline HCl.

 A two-100 1/2L spray dose (a total of 200 1/2L) of Kovacaine Mist contains 6 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.

1 mg oxymetazoline HCl.

 A two-200 1/2L spray dose (a total of 400 1/2L) of Kovacaine Mist contains 12 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.

2 mg oxymetazoline HCl.

 Kovacaine Mist will be administered based on the weight of the subject as summarized in the table below.

 Subjects weighing 10 to 1/2L of Kovacaine Mist at time D0.

 Subjects weighing 20 to 1/2L (total dose 200 1/2L) administered 4 minutes apart at times D0 and D4.

 Subjects weighing 40 kg or more will receive 2 intranasal sprays of 200 1/2L (total dose 400 1/2L) administered 4 minutes apart at times D0 and D4.
