(firstQuint)Immune Response Regulation and Nutritional Status of the Crohn's Disease Patients.

.

 The patients were split into two groups: one group was supplemented with whey protein and the other, with soy protein.

 Participants were assessed at three moments: before starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks.

 The nutritional status and body composition were measured using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages.

 Dietary intake was determined by 24-h dietary recalls.

 The disease activity was evaluated by Crohn's Disease Activity Index, serum cytokines and C-reactive protein dosages.
