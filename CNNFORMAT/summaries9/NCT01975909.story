(fifthQuint)Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia.

 Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) refers to a family of genetic diseases that cause progressive problems with gait and balance, as well as other debilitating symptoms.

 There is no cure for SCA and a lack of an effective symptomatic treatment.

 Investigators will recruit 20 patients with genetically-confirmed SCA to use a novel approach - noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - to improve balance, gait, and posture in patients with SCA.

 Half will be randomly assigned to a real intervention, and half to a sham (control) intervention.

 The TMS intervention will consist of 20 stimulation sessions over a four week period.

 At baseline and follow-up, patients will undergo comprehensive assessments including several SCA rating scales, along with sophisticated tests of balance (ie.

 walking, standing, and muscle coordination).

 Patients will also complete a series of neurophysiologic tests to evaluate the function of the cerebellum and its connections before and after the intervention.

 Investigators anticipate patients receiving real TMS will show better balance, fewer falls, and improved mobility, while those undergoing sham stimulation will show no benefits.

 If our prediction is correct, this study will provide evidence-based support for a new treatment to improve the lives of patients with SCA.

 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia@highlight

Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) refers to a family of genetic diseases that cause progressive problems with gait and balance, as well as other debilitating symptoms.

 This is a randomized controlled pilot study to test a novel therapeutic intervention that uses noninvasive magnetic brain stimulation to improve functional outcomes in patients with SCA.

 The study will include quantitative evaluations of gait, balance, and brain physiology to examine possible objective end-points for a future, larger multi-site clinical trial.

 The investigators anticipate that patients receiving the real intervention will show a functional gain.
