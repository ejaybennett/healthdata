(firstQuint)PhotoDynamic Therapy for Line Infection Prevention (PLIP): Pilot Study on Healthy Volunteers.

.

 Antiseptics are routinely utilized to prevent infections of vascular catheters.

 We are evaluating the addition of methylene blue and light activation on skin to determine whether this inexpensive and non-toxic treatment can decrease skin pathogens and prevent blood stream infections of long-term vascular catheters.

 This is a pilot study of normal volunteers to determine the effect on the microbiome of the addition of methylene blue and light activation on antiseptic-treated skin.
