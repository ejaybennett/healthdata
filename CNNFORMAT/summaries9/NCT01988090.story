(thirdQuint)High Dose Vitamin D vs Standard Dose Vitamin D Study.

 Treatments with anti-estrogen agents for hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most efficacious of systemic therapies, with aromatase inhibitors (AI's) being considered the most active anti-estrogen therapy in early stage breast cancer.

 But, use of these treatments has been shown to cause musculoskeletal (joint/muscle) side effects that sometimes cause patients to discontinue the use of them.

 Also, Vitamin D deficiency is a well know cause of a wide array of musculoskeletal issues.

 There is evidence that Vitamin D supplementation may help prevent arthralgia while on AI's.

 Therefore, the investigators want to see if giving a higher dose of Vitamin D could decrease the incidence of AIA as compared to a standard dose of Vitamin D.

 The investigators believe that this could possibly result in patients continued treatment with AI therapy for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

 High Dose Vitamin D vs Standard Dose Vitamin D Study@highlight

This study is being done to look at the difference, if there is a difference between two different doses of Vitamin D and the reduction of joint/muscle pain (arthralgia)that is caused by taking anti-estrogen medications (aromatase inhibitors) by breast cancer patients.

 The investigators hope to learn if taking a higher dose of Vitamin D is a good way to prevent aromatase inhibitor arthralgia (AIA).
