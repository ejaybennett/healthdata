(firstQuint)Prothrombotic Factors and Anaesthesia in Prostate Cancer.

 The utility of anti-thrombotic prophylaxis in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) is still controversial.

 Moreover, different anaesthetic techniques could modify coagulant factors.

 Thus, in this study we will be to investigate the variations of pro- and anti-coagulant and fibrinolytic factors in two established types of anaesthesia in patients with prostate cancer undergoing elective LRP.
