(thirdQuint)EoE(Eosinophilic Esophagitis).

 Eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE) is a form of chronic inflammation affecting the esophagus which often results in wall thickening and esophageal stiffening and is associated with complications, such as esophageal tears and strictures (narrowings).

 Chronic dysphagia and acute food impaction (swallowed food stuck in the esophagus) are common symptoms of EoE and are associated with esophageal wall thickening and stiffness.

 Current diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy with biopsy give only limited information about changes in the esophageal wall in eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).

 In routine clinical practice, repeat endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is commonly performed about 3-6 months after initial therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).

 However, follow-up endoscopy with biopsy has drawbacks as it is invasive, costly and typically requires deep sedation or general anesthesia.

 We propose to evaluate quantitative MRI as a potential non-invasive diagnostic option for evaluating esophageal wall remodeling in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).

To evaluate quantitative magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) as a potential non-invasive, radiation-free diagnostic tool for evaluating esophageal wall remodeling (thickness and stiffness) and response to treatment in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) presenting with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction.
