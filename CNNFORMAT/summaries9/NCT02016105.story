(firstQuint)Study to Demonstrate Equivalent Efficacy and to Compare Safety of Biosimilar Adalimumab (GP2017) and Humira.

 The aim of this study (Treatment Period 1) was to demonstrate equivalent efficacy, primarily based on the PASI75 response rate at Week 16, and similar safety of the proposed biosimilar GP2017 and Humira in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis at the end of Treatment Period 1, after 17 weeks of study treatment.

 The subsequent Treatment Period 2 (Week 17 to Week 35) and the Extension Period (Week 35 to Week 51) were performed to evaluate long-term effects, including immunogenicity (i.

e.

 ADAs), and the effects of repeated switching between GP2017 and Humira.
