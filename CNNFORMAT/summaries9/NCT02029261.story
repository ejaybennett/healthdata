(firstQuint)Observational Study of Insulin Resistance and Muscle Wasting After Burn Injury.

 Burn injury induces insulin resistance and our investigators have previous shown the importance of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated pathways.

 This project will establish the inhibitory effects of burn injury on IRS-1 mediated signaling in human skeletal muscle of burn patients.
