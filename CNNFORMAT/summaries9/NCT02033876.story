(thirdQuint)Ursodiol on Insulin Sensitivity, Gastric Emptying and Body Weight With Type 2 Diabetes on Metformin.

 Background: Intra-jejunal administration of bile acids improves insulin sensitivity.

 Hypothesis: The bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in delayed (ileocolonic)-release formulation, stimulates TGR-5 and FXR receptors in the ileum and colon, increasing the secretion of FGF-19, GLP-1, oxyntomodulin (OXM), and PYY3-36, improving insulin sensitivity and inducing weight loss.

 Aim: To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of UDCA on insulin sensitivity, postprandial plasma glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying and body weight in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects on monotherapy with metformin.

 Study design: This is a single center, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose randomized controlled trial to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release UDCA 600 mg twice daily on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy)and weight loss in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects.

 Participants will be receiving monotherapy with metformin.

 Blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure glycemia and the incretin (GLP-1, OXM, PYY3-36) fasting levels and responses to the meal.

 Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, UDCA will increase insulin sensitivity, enhance glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay GE of liquids.

 Significance: This study will prove that ileocolonic-release UDCA enhances glycemic control in T2DM patients.

 Ursodiol on Insulin Sensitivity, Gastric Emptying and Body Weight With Type 2 Diabetes on Metformin@highlight

This study will evaluate whether bile acids are able to increase insulin sensitivity and enhance glycemic control in T2DM patients, as well as exploring the mechanisms that enhance glycemic control.

 These observations will provide the preliminary data for proposing future therapeutic as well as further mechanistic studies of the role of bile acids in the control of glycemia in T2DM.
