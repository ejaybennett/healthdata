(thirdQuint)Bioequivalence Study of IG-001 Versus Nab-paclitaxel in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer.

 This study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IG-001 and nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer.

 Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized to determine which drug is administered first.

 - Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive a single dose of IG-001 (Period 1) followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of nab-paclitaxel (Period 2).

 - Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive a single dose of nab-paclitaxel (Period 1) followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of IG-001 (Period 2).

 Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at specified times before, during, and after the infusion of each drug in Periods 1 and 2.

 Following successful completion of Period 1 and Period 2, patients may be eligible for up to 4 additional cycles of treatment with IG-001 in the extension study.

 Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Bioequivalence Study of IG-001 Versus Nab-paclitaxel in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer@highlight

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence of IG-001 versus nab-paclitaxel in female patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer.

 In addition, the study will compare the safety and tolerance of IG-001 and nab-paclitaxel during the bioequivalence 2-period crossover portion of the study.

 The study will also evaluate the long-term safety of IG-001 over repeated cycles, up to 4 additional cycles of administration.
