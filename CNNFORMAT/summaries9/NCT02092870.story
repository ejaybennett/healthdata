(firstQuint)Adipose Derived Regenerative Cellular Therapy of Chronic Wounds.

 In an attempt to explore the contribution of Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) to chronic wound healing, we will investigate the effects of injecting ASCs into the periphery and debrided surfaces of chronic wounds.

 Our goal is to achieve healing in two months, and for the wounds to stay healed for the following two weeks.
