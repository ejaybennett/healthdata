(firstQuint)Comparing Pleth Variability Index (PVI) Measurements at Different Sensing Locations.

 The aim of this study is to compare Pleth Variability Index (PVI) measurements at different sensor locations in respect to signal quality, sensor fit to site location and fluid responsiveness.

 PVI will be measured at 3 different sensor sites: the fingers, ear lobes and forehead.

 The ability to predict fluid responsiveness will be analyzed using cardiac output as the reference value.
