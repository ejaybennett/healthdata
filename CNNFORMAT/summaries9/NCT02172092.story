(thirdQuint)Fluid Kinetics in Patients With Diabetic Ketoacidosis.

 Patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis receive 1000 ml of Sodium Chloride during the first 30 minutes of treatment.

 Before, during and after this infusion regular blood samples(and urine) are collected (0, 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 120, 180 and 300 minutes after infusion start).

 B-Hemoglobin, P-Albumine, B-Glucose, P-Sodium, P-Potassium.

 P-Chlorides, U-Sodium, U-Chloride and U-Glucose.

 Hourly volume of urine is measured.

 The 30 minute infusion can be used to calculate the urine extracellular volume.

 Thereafter during infusion of Ringers acetate changes in electrolytes in blood as well as urine volume and in the urine excreted electrolytes can be used to calculate the fluid shifts between the different fluid compartments.

 Eventually 8 to 12 hours later a second infusion of SodiumChloride is as a control performed.

 Fluid Kinetics in Patients With Diabetic Ketoacidosis@highlight

The purpose with the study is to follow the fluid shifts that occur during fluid resuscitation of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.

 In the study measurements of changes in blood and urine concentrations of Sodium and Chloride as well as blood hemoglobin are used to mathematically calculate changes in distribution volumes of these different endogenous markers.
