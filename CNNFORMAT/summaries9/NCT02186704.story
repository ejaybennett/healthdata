(fifthQuint)Sensing Atrial High Rate Episodes With Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators Trial (The SENSE Trial).

 The SENSE Trial is designed to study the efficacy of the DX System in detection of atrial high rate episodes (AHREs) in subjects with no prior history of atrial fibrillation.

 The DX System, or "DX," consists of a Biotronik DX ICD, and the Biotronik Linox Smart S DX lead which is an FDA approved ICD system that incorporates use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles.

 The SENSE Trial will be conducted at 8-12 U.

S.

 sites.

 The lead coordinating site will be at Weill Cornell Medical College.

 Subjects will be followed for 1 year to assess for the primary endpoints of the trial.

 Sensing Atrial High Rate Episodes With Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators Trial (The SENSE Trial)@highlight

The primary aim of the "Sensing Atrial High Rate Episodes with DX System in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Trial" (SENSE Trial) is to assess the efficacy of a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles in detecting atrial high rate episodes.

 The study hypothesis is that an ICD system with a lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles will have a diagnostic yield comparable to that of a standard dual chamber ICD system and superior to that of a standard single chamber ICD system.
