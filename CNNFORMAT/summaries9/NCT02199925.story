(thirdQuint)An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of High-Dose Gammaplex in Children on the Autism Spectrum.

 We have come to believe that an immature immune system with abnormal signaling and altered apoptotic pathways may result in a process of neuroinflammation with a clinical presentation of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

 If Autism Spectrum Disorders are the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process that prevents the infant brain from forming the proper neural connections, then treatment that reduces inflammation might have a positive impact on autism.

 We believe that there is a correlation between immunological abnormalities and the development of the autism.

If autism is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process preventing the infant brain from forming the proper neural connections, then treatment that reduces inflammation might have a positive impact on autism.

 IGIV treatment has been known to suppress inflammation and has been used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases.
