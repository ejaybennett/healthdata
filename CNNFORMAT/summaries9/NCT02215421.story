(fifthQuint)Mommio: Training in Vegetable Parenting.

 Video games for parents that simulate interactions with a child using a narrative, offering feedback on performance and goal setting for changing practices in the real world, and addressing vegetable (V) feeding problems commonly reported by parents, may elicit desirable cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes.

 The rationale for training parents of preschool children in effective V parenting practices is that: 1) parents have an important influence on young children's dietary intake; 2) child dietary intake tracks into the adult years; and 3) high V consumption protects against several chronic diseases later in life.

 Since parents of young children commonly complain about not getting their child to eat V, there should be broad interest in playing Mommio.

 A pre-post randomized clinical trial with 110 parents of 3-5 year olds who report having difficulty getting their child to eat vegetables will be employed.

 The primary outcome will be parent report of children's dietary intake; the secondary outcome will be use of V parenting practices.

 We had to discontinue the study since changes in commercial availability of game development software required reprogramming and available funding did not allow for completion of game programming.

 Thus, no game evaluation was possible.

 Mommio: Training in Vegetable Parenting@highlight

A 20 episode video game called Mommio simulates parent-child feeding interactions for parents of 3-5 year old children within a storyline addressing a problem commonly reported by parents (getting their 3-5 yo to taste a vegetable, which is often a first step toward eating the vegetable), thereby training parents in effective food parenting practices.

 This research evaluates whether the 20 episodes targeting barriers identified by parents across five levels of difficulty influences vegetable parenting practices and children's dietary intake.

 We had to discontinue the study since changes in commercial availability of game development software required reprogramming and available funding did not allow for completion of game programming.
