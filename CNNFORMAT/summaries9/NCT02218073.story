(fifthQuint)Pharmacokinetic Study of JNJ-42756493 in Healthy Participants.

 This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), 2-way crossover, single-dose, and single-center, Phase 1 study of oral JNJ-42756493 in healthy participants.

 The duration of the study is approximately 36-63 days: 2-20 days Screening, two 7 days open-label treatment periods, 12-14 days washout and 12-14-day follow-up (Day 13-15 of period 2).

 All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences.

 In Treatment Sequence AB: JNJ-42756493 10 mg tablet formulation will be administered on Day 1 of Period 1 and 100 mcg JNJ-61818549 will be administered intravenously 2 hours after the intake of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 oral solution on Day 1 of Period 2.

 In Treatment Sequence BA: 100 mcg JNJ-61818549 will be administered intravenously after the intake of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 oral solution on Day 1 of Period 1 and 10 mg JNJ-42756493 tablet formulation will be administered on Day 1 of Period 2.

 A minimum 12 days washout is required between treatment periods.

 Participants will primarily be analyzed for pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time).

 Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Pharmacokinetic Study of JNJ-42756493 in Healthy Participants@highlight

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absolute bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-42756493 following a single 10 milligram (mg) dose as an oral solution administered in combination with a single intravenous administration of a microdose (100 microgram [mcg]) of JNJ-61818549 and to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 following an oral solution (reference) and a tablet (test) formulation in a crossover (method used to switch subjects from one study group to another in a clinical trial) design in healthy participants.
