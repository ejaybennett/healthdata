(fifthQuint)Effects of a PUFA-rich Diet on Acute Metabolic and Inflammatory High-Fat Meal Responses.

 Eating more saturated fats has been shown to decrease how many calories an individual burns and increase chronic disease risk by increasing inflammation, coagulation (blood clotting) potential, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

 Conversely, eating more poly-unsaturated fats has been linked to decreased risk of chronic diseases.

 The goal of this study is to determine whether or not eating a diet containing a lot of poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the damaging effects of eating occasional high-fat meals that are high in saturated fats.

 Those damaging effects we are interested in studying include how much fat and calories a person's body burns, and measuring some markers of chronic disease risk in the blood (inflammation markers and blood clotting markers).

 Effects of a PUFA-rich Diet on Acute Metabolic and Inflammatory High-Fat Meal Responses@highlight

This study evaluates whether a diet rich in poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the negative effects of high saturated fat meals on metabolic, inflammatory, and coagulation responses.

 Half of the participants will receive a high polyunsaturated fat diet )50% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 35% fat.

 21% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated fatty acids, 9% mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 5% saturated fatty acids) for 7 days, while the other half will receive a control diet 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein.

 Only, 7% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated fatty acids, 15% of total energy will be mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 13% of total energy will be saturated fatty acids.
