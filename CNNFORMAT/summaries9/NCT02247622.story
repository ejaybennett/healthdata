(firstQuint)Telomere Length and Other Parameters of Telomere Dysfunction in PSC and Colitis.

 Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders with malignant potential.

 Telomerase is an enzyme complex that lengthens telomeres and has enhanced expression in numerous malignancies.

 In this study, we evaluated the telomerase gene copy number, telomere length, cells in senescence, aneuploidy and additional parameters of telomere dysfunction from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients.

 Telomere Length and Other Parameters of Telomere Dysfunction in PSC and Colitis@highlight

PSC is a chronic cholestatic disorder.

 The investigators intend to study some telomere parameters and telomere length in order to predict a premalignant state.
