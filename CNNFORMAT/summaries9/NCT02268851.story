(thirdQuint)A Phase I/Ib Safety and Efficacy Study of the PI3K-delta Inhibitor TGR-1202 and Ibrutinib in Patients With CLL or MCL.

 This research study is a Phase I and Ib combination clinical trial, which aims to both evaluate the safety of an investigational drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to evaluate in later clinical trials.

 "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

 It also means that the FDA (U.

S.

 Food and Drug Administration) has not approved TGR-1202 in the United States for use in MCL/CLL/SLL cancers.

 TGR-1202 is a newly developed drug that may stop cancer cells from growing based on recent laboratory experiments.

 The results from these experiments suggest this drug may help to kill cancer cells when coupled with ibrutinib.

 In this research study, the safety and tolerability of TGR-1202 is being investigated to determine the highest dose that can safely be used in combination with ibrutinib.

 The study is also aimed to evaluate whether TGR-1202 has any effect on tumor growth (nodal response), and to determine the overall repsonse rate and duration of response in patients with CLL/SLL or MCL.

This research study will be evaluating the safety and efficacy of a study drug called TGR-1202 in combination with a known drug ibrutinib, also known as Imbruvica, as a possible treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) that has come back or that has not responded to standard treatment.
