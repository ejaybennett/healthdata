(fifthQuint)Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat in the Treatment of Anemia in Stable Dialysis Subjects.

 This study will consist of three study periods as follows: 1.

 Screening Period of up to 6 weeks (8 weeks if on Mircera) 2.

 Treatment Period: a minimum of 52 weeks, a maximum of up to 3 years.

 3.

 A Follow-up period of 4 weeks.

 A total of up to 820 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roxadustat or Epoetin alfa (Active Control) in an open-label manner.

 Under Amendment 1, approximately 150 incident dialysis subjects will be randomized to either roxadustat or epoetin alfa (active control) in a 1:1 ratio.

 Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat in the Treatment of Anemia in Stable Dialysis Subjects@highlight

The purpose of this study is to determine whether roxadustat is effective and safe compared to epoetin alfa in the maintenance treatment of anemia in stable hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis subjects when converted from their existing stable erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatment.

 Amendment 1: The primary purpose of this amendment is to evaluate safety and efficacy of roxadustat compared to epoetin-alfa in newly initiated (incident) dialysis subjects who have been on ESA ( 4 weeks) for treatment of anemia prior to screening
