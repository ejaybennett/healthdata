(fifthQuint)De-intensification of Radiation and Chemotherapy for Low-Risk HPV-related Oropharyngeal SCC: Follow-up Study.

 The proposed study is a follow-up study to NCT01530997.

 In NCT01530997, patients with HPV positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) received de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited surgical evaluation.

 The primary endpoint of NCT01530997 was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT.

 Power computations were performed for N=40 and were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR for de-intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 87%, the historical rate.

 The type 1 error for this calculation was 14.

2%.

 43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary endpoint.

 The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38).

 Since the observed pCR rate was excellent in NCT01530997 and was in concordance with the expected rate, in the proposed study we will not mandate a post-CRT surgical evaluation.

 Instead a PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks post-CRT will be used to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed.

 De-intensification of Radiation and Chemotherapy for Low-Risk HPV-related Oropharyngeal SCC: Follow-up Study@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.

 The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, > 90%.

 The standard treatment for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin.

 Sometimes surgery is performed afterwards.

 This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term complications.

 This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen.

 Patients in this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy.
