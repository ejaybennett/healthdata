(secondQuint)Safety and Immunogenicity of Different Schedules of Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) in Healthy Participants.

 The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV).

 TDV is being tested to assess how different dosing schedules of the vaccine effect immunity to dengue fever in dengue endemic countries.

 This study will look at the number of antibodies to dengue fever formed in people who are administered different dosing schedules of TDV.

 The study will randomize approximately 1800 patients.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups in a 1:2:5:1 ratio-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Group 1 - TDV 0.

5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection Days 1 and 91 - Group 2 - TDV 0.

5 mL SC injection Day 1 - Group 3 - TDV 0.

5 mL SC injection Days 1 and 365 - Placebo (dummy SC) - this is a liquid that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient In order to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the patient and the doctor, participants will receive a placebo injection at any study visit where TDV is not being administered (Days 91 and/or 365).

 Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card for 28 days after each vaccination.

 This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Asia and Latin America.

 The overall time to participate in this study is up to 18 months.

 Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic including a final visit 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
