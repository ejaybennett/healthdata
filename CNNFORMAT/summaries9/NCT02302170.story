(fifthQuint)A Phase  Clinical Trial With Oral Recombinant Helicobacter Pylori Vaccine in Chinese Children.

 Helicobacter pylori (H.

 pylori) is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that persistently colonizes the human stomach; more than half the human population is infected worldwide.

 H.

 pylori infection is the major risk factor for the development of gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer.

 At present, the main clinical treatment for H.

 pylori infection is the application of antibiotics and bismuth agent or H+ antagonists.

 Due to the widespread drug resistance, toxic side effects, high medical costs as well as poor patient compliance, it is unworkable to practice antibiotics therapy for H.

 pylori eradication on every patient.

 Vaccination is the most effective way for prevention H.

 pylori infection.

 Since H.

 pylori were found, great attention has been given to the H.

 pylori vaccine, scientists worldwide have made great efforts to develop both prophylactic and therapeutic H.

 pylori vaccine.

 Numerous H.

 pylori vaccine approaches have been studied, including inactivated whole cell H.

 pylori vaccine, genetic engineering subunit vaccine, live vector vaccines.

 Urease is considered to be an excellent candidate antigen for vaccine against H.

 pylori.

 However, no vaccine against H.

 pylori has been used in clinic.

 The phaseIand IIclinical trial of oral recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine had completed in Jiangsu Province in China.

 The data from phaseIand IIclinical trial suggested that the oral recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for children.

 To further explore the safety and immunogenicity profile of this vaccine, a phase III clinical trial was conducted.
