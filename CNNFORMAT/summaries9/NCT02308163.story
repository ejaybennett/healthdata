(secondQuint)A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of ASP015K in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Had an Inadequate Response to DMARDs.

 This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K alone or in combination with DMARDs in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to DMARDs.

 Etanercept will also be administered as the reference drug in an open-label manner.

 The study drug will be orally administered once daily (QD) after breakfast for 52 weeks.

 Etanercept will be administered subcutaneously QD for 52 weeks.

 At Week 12, subjects in the placebo group will be switched to ASP015K.

 The dose of ASP015K to be started at Week 12 for the placebo group will be determined randomly at baseline in advance and switched in a blinded manner.

 Subjects in ASP015K group or placebo groups who have completed the study will be eligible for participation in an open-label extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2).
