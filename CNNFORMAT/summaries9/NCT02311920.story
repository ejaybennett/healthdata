(fifthQuint)Ipilimumab and/or Nivolumab in Combination With Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine the maximum safe dose of single-agent treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab and the combination when given with temozolomide during maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Collect and record the side effect profiles for single-agent treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and the combination when given with temozolomide during the maintenance phase for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

 II.

 Perform pilot studies of immune cells within tumor samples, e.

g.

 phenotyping tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by interrogating tumor tissues from diagnostic tumor blocks.

 III.

 Report the number of patients alive at 1 and 2 years after the start of single-agent treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and the combination when given with temozolomide during the maintenance phase for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 4 weeks for 4 courses and then beginning 3 months after course 4 once every 3 months for 4 courses in the absence unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM II: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide PO on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks in the absence unacceptable toxicity.

 ARM III: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide PO on days 1-5.

 Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 4 weeks for 4 courses and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for 64 weeks in the absence unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, and then every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

 Ipilimumab and/or Nivolumab in Combination With Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma@highlight

This phase I trial studies the safety and best dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab, or both in combination with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

 Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 It is not yet known which combination is a better treatment for glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.
