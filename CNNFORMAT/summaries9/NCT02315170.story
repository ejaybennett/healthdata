(firstQuint)Assessment of Novel Intraocular Injection Guide.

 This study is being conducted to assess the potential for an intraocular injection guide to increase comfort levels both during and after such injections.

 The hypothesis is that patients will feel increased comfort from a device which eliminates the need for a speculum while still keeping the eyelids apart, allowing a physician to deliver treatment.

 The results of this study will allow physicians to select the optimal device for patient comfort and well-being during intravitreal injections.
