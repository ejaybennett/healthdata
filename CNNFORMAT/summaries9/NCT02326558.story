(secondQuint)Comparison of Microwave Ablation-Assisted Enucleation and Conventional Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy in the Treatment of T1a Renal Cell Carcinoma.

 Microwave ablation has been widely used in the minimally-invasive treatment of renal tumors.

 Recently, a technique of laparoscopic microwave ablation-assisted renal tumor enucleation was developed, but the experience was preliminary.

 This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficiency of this technique, particularly its role in the preservation of renal function, in comparison with conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
