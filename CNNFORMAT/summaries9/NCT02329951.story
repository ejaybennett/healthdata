(fifthQuint)Predictive Factors for LBP Interventional Treatment Outcomes.

 This will be an observational study with a 3-month follow-up.

 The course of clinical treatment will be decided by a physician independent of the research.

 Besides filling out questionnaires and standardized follow-up visits, all subjects will receive the same care they would if they did not participate in the study.

 The study will be discussed with the subjects and they will be enrolled in the study after it is determined that they meet selection criteria and are scheduled for one of the above injections.

 They will then fill out all of the questionnaires.

 All procedures will be performed with fluoroscopy.

 Following each procedure, the procedure-related pain will be reported on a 0-10 scale (all patients will receive as much 1% lidocaine local anesthetic as is necessary), including the reported pain to the standardized skin wheal at the start of the procedure.

 Patients will then receive standardized epidural steroid injections (transforaminal or interlaminar), sacroiliac joint injections, or facet blocks and radiofrequency denervation if they experience a positive block.

 Details about these procedures are available upon request.

 No patients will be permitted additional interventions between the time of their procedure and follow-up visits.

 Rescue medications will be in the form of either tramadol, NSAIDs or if the patient is on opioids, a 2-point decrease in average LBP coupled with a positive satisfaction rating (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale).

 Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at their initial 1-month follow-up visit will remain in the study and return for the final 3-month follow-up visit.

 Those with a negative outcome will exit the study "per protocol" to receive standard care, which may consist of other injections or non-rescue medications such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants.

 Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at 1-month but experience a recurrence before their 3-month follow-up visit will also exit the study per protocol, with their final outcome measures recorded before they receive standard care.

 Predictive Factors for LBP Interventional Treatment Outcomes@highlight

In this study, we are attempting to determine which factors are associated with interventional treatment outcome for LBP (and to what extent).

 Up to 346 patients with LBP who are considered to be good candidates for therapeutic interventional procedures will be given a complete history and physical exam, which includes the assessment of Waddell signs, and querying them regarding factors shown in non-interventional studies or retrospective studies evaluating interventional treatments to be associated with negative treatment outcomes.

 These factors include the presence of Waddell and other physical exam signs, opioid use, allergies, psychopathology, concomitant pain conditions, a 6-point Likert scale on expectations, sleep abnormalities, secondary gain (e.

g.

 medical board or litigation), procedure-related pain, obesity, and smoking history.

 They will then proceed to undergo their scheduled intervention, which will be limited to epidural steroid injections (ESI), facet blocks and if positive, radiofrequency denervation, and sacroiliac (SI) joint injections.

 A positive outcome will be defined as > 50% pain relief based on average pain score at 1-month and a score of at least 4 on a 1-5 Likert satisfaction scale.

 Those with a positive outcome at 1-month will remain in the study and be followed again at 3-months.
