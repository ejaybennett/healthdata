(fifthQuint)Alberta Cancer Exercise Pilot Randomized Trial.

 Purpose: The primary purpose of this proposed study is to pilot test the planned Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE) program evaluation components at the level of the individual cancer survivor.

 These components include program reach as well as effectiveness as determined by outcomes of physical fitness, symptoms, and quality of life.

 This proposed study will enable us to formalize an evaluation strategy to inform effectiveness and implementation of the ACE program.

 Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be utilized to examine the short-term effectiveness of the proposed community-based cancer exercise program designed for cancer survivors.

 The study will take place at the Cross Cancer Institute/University of Alberta and Tom Baker Cancer Centre/ University of Calgary as well as in selected YMCA community fitness centres in Edmonton and Calgary.

 The exercise intervention will be delivered by specially trained exercise professionals who have completed the formal cancer exercise education course.

 Eighty participants will be randomized to early (intervention group) or delayed community-based exercise programming (standard care group).

 Participants randomized to the intervention group will undertake the ACE Program at a selected Edmonton and Calgary YMCA for an 8-week period.

 Following the 8-week supervised intervention period, participants will have the option to continue on a 'fee for service' basis or to continue with self-directed exercise at home.

 Participants allocated to the standard care group will receive standard advice and counseling on physical activity and will serve as the 'control group' for a 16-week period.

 The standard care group will be offered participation in the 8-week ACE program at the completion of the 16-week follow-up period.

 Outcomes: The primary outcome is program feasibility: recruitment, completion and adherence rates.

 For the purposes of the proposed study and the length of follow-up of 24 weeks, the RE-AIM components of Reach, Effectiveness and Implementation at the level of the individual will be evaluated as potential outcome indicators for the ACE program.

 Outcomes will include measures of health-related physical fitness, cancer-related symptoms and quality of life.

 Summary: ACE is an active living initiative, encouraging cancer survivors in Alberta to take a role in their own wellbeing by supporting participation in cancer-specific community-based exercise programs.

 Alberta Cancer Exercise Pilot Randomized Trial@highlight

The purpose of the study is to examine the benefit and specific outcomes of a community-based exercise program that is designed to address the needs of individuals who are receiving or recovering from cancer treatment.

 Eighty cancer survivors from Edmonton and Calgary will take part in the 24-week long study.

 Survivors will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

 The first group will take part in an 8-week supervised exercise program followed by 8 weeks of self-directed or home-based exercise (early exercise group).

 The other 40 participants will continue with their normal activities for 16 weeks (delayed exercise group).

 After the 16 week period, participants in the delayed exercise group will take part in the 8-week supervised exercise program.

 Exercise sessions will take place at selected YMCAs in Edmonton and Calgary.

 Exercise sessions will be supervised by specially trained exercise specialists who have received special training in exercise and cancer.

 Outcomes of the study will include feasibility, physical fitness measures, cancer-related symptoms and quality of life.
