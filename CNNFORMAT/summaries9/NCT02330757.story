(firstQuint)HRT Versus MOS for Endometrial Preparation Prior to FET in Non PCOS Patients.

 Women will be randomly divided into two groups; one will be subjected to endometrial preparation by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the other will be subjected to minimal ovarian stimulation (MOS).

 Women in the HRT group will be given estradiol valerate 4 mg daily from day 2 to day 12 of the cycle then the endometrial thickness will be assessed on day 13 by transvaginal sonography (TVS).

 If the endometrium is 8 mm and of moderate echogenicity, luteal phase support (using progesterone supplements) will be started but if the endometrium is 18 mm in diameter followed by luteal phase support (using progesterone supplements) after 48 hours.

 In both groups, FET will be planned in the appropriate day according to the stage that the embryos have been cryopreserved in it.
