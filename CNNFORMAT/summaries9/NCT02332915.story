(fifthQuint)Treatment Intensity - Apraxia of Speech.

 This research is designed to examine the effects of treatment intensity on outcomes associated with an established treatment for acquired apraxia of speech (AOS).

 Intensity in the form of dose frequency and total intervention duration will be evaluated with Sound Production Treatment (SPT).

 The investigators will examine the effects of intense dose frequency (nine, one-hour sessions per week) and traditional dose frequency (three, one hour sessions per week).

 Total number of treatment sessions will be held constant allowing for comparison of total intervention duration (27 sessions over 3 weeks versus 27 sessions over 9 weeks).

 A two-phase, group cross-over design will be used.

 Thirty-six participants with chronic aphasia and AOS will be quasi-randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - intense first or traditional first (18 per group).

 One group will receive SPT applied with intense dose frequency (SPT-I) followed by SPT applied with traditional dose frequency (SPT-T).

 The other group will receive the treatments in the reverse order (SPT-T followed by SPT-I).

 A two week no treatment interval will separate the treatment phases.

 The outcomes of interest will address changes in trained speech behaviors, untrained speech behaviors, and speech intelligibility and patient-rated communicative functioning.

 Treatment Intensity - Apraxia of Speech@highlight

A growing neurorehabilitation literature suggests that intense treatment may be desired to maximize the effects of therapy following neurologic injury.

 This investigation is designed to facilitate the development of efficacious, clinically applicable treatment for acquired apraxia of speech by examining the effects of intensity of treatment (e.

g.

, 9 hours per week vs.

 3 hours per week, while holding total number of sessions constant) with a group of speakers who have chronic apraxia of speech and aphasia.
