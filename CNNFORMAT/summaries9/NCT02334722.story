(thirdQuint)1 Week Versus 6 Weeks of Levetiracetam in Surgical Brain Tumor Patients.

 Because seizures are one of the leading neurologic complications in brain tumor patients, neurosurgeons prescribe antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to help prevent them.

 Although the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines recommend that AEDs be stopped after the first post-operative week in patients without seizures, there is no standard length of treatment and some patients may stay on AEDs indefinitely.

 In an attempt to develop clinical guidelines for AED use in post-operative brain tumor patients, we will try to determine if taking levetiracetam extended-release (Keppra XR) for 1 week results in less neurotoxicity than taking it for 6 weeks.

 1 Week Versus 6 Weeks of Levetiracetam in Surgical Brain Tumor Patients@highlight

The purpose of this study is to see if there are any differences between patients who receive Levetiracetam extended-release tablets for one week after surgery to remove a brain tumor versus those who receive Levetiracetam extended-release tablets for six weeks after surgery.

 Specifically, we will see if one group has less side effects than the other, and whether or not one group has more seizures than the other.
