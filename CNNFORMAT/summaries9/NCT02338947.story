(fifthQuint)Off-pump Versus On-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Frail Patients.

 One of the most controversial areas of cardiac surgery has been whether off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) surgery is superior to conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

 There is an ongoing debate about the benefits and disadvantages of OPCAB.

 Initial trials have shown that off-pump CABG is feasible in selected low-risk patients and offers results similar to those of CABG performed with the conventional on-pump technique (on-pump CABG)[1,2].

 In institutions with experience in off-pump CABG, the rates of major adverse events and of complete revascularization and graft patency have been similar to those with on-pump CABG[3].

 These positive results have been called into question by reports of inferior graft patency and higher rates of repeat target-vessel revascularization associated with off-pump CABG[4,5].

 The Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) trial[6] showed that, among low-risk patients, the rate of death or major adverse events at 30 days after surgery was similar with off-pump and on-pump CABG, but off-pump CABG was associated with a higher rate of incomplete revascularization at 1 year.

 Short-term mortality and morbidity after off-pump and on-pump CABG were similar in a recent trial involving 4752 patients with a mixed operative-risk profile (the CABG Off- or On-Pump Revascularization Study [CORONARY])[7].

 The German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Elderly Patients (GOPCABE)[8] study focused exclusively on patients 75 years of age or older.

 However, this trial would not elucidate the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in high-risk patients because this specific group of German patients were moderate risk patients.

 The results of the Best Bypass Surgery (BBS) trial[9], performed on 341 high-risk patients (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation "EuroSCORE">5) undergoing on-pump CABG or off-pump CABG, reported no significant differences in the composite of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events or in any of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, low cardiac output/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention.

 However, in our opinion, the definition of high-risk patient should be interpreted carefully, since the EuroSCORE identifies patients based on 18 independent variables, many of which were not considered in the study.

 Risk factors such as previous cardiac surgery, critical preoperative state, emergency operation, and poor left ventricular dysfunction were excluded.

 Furthermore, active endocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, other than isolated CABG, surgery on the thoracic aorta, and postinfarction septal rupture were not considered due to the nature of the study.

 Chronic pulmonary disease and neurological dysfunction were not defined according to EuroSCORE, and there is no information on patients with unstable angina.

 In the real world, with more than 1500 patients, we showed lower mortality among patients who underwent off-pump CABG[10].

 So, after a certain cut-off EuroSCORE > 4.

5 or 2000 Bernstein-Parsonnet score >17.

75, off-pump CABG significantly reduces death rates.

 Indeed, numerous large retrospective studies and meta-analyses have shown significant short-term improvements after OPCAB and comparable long-term outcomes.

 A recent risk-adjusted analysis of the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database assessing 876,081 patients demonstrated a significant reduction in death and stroke (11% and 34% reduction, respectively) after OPCAB, seen in both low- and high-volume centers[11].

 After that, it is important to reconsider the best approach for patients with higher surgical risk for CABG.

 Clearly, a base is being built with strong scientific evidence that this is the group that experiences the most benefit from off-pump CABG.

 This evidence allows not using cardiopulmonary bypass to be the main surgical approach, and complete revascularization and greater use of arterial grafts in patients with high surgical risk as the second plan[12].

 Actually, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate a significant mortality benefit for OPCAB[13].

 However, the available RCTs were underpowered to detect significant differences between the groups and suffered from high selection and exclusion biases.

 Even more important is the fact that the available RCTs so far have primarily focused only on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients in whom the benefits of OPCAB should be well defined.

 Moreover, the conversion rates (12.

4% in ROOBY, 7.

9% in CORONARY, and 5% in GOPCABE) may suggest that some of the participating surgeons were inexperienced because expert centers report conversion rates between 2% and 4%[14], which significantly affects long-term outcomes.

 We believe that avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass should be viewed primarily as a step toward avoiding aortic manipulation.

 Despite the long-term benefits of surgery, some patients may choose percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of complex multivessel disease to avoid the morbidity associated with CABG, of which stroke is the most feared.

 Expert OPCAB surgeons can offer equivalent durability of graft patency as in CABG, with a lower rate of stroke if aortic manipulation is avoided.

 Authors make mistakes in pointing out that on-pump CABG should be able to be performed under all circumstances, on all patients, at all institutions, regardless of their cardiac volume[14].

 Thus, for example, owing to this rather conflicting evidence, either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG surgery could be offered to patients with chronic kidney disease, depending on the complexity of coronary disease and comorbidities.

 If PCI is recommended, appropriate measures should be employed to prevent contrast-induced worsening of renal function.

 If CABG surgery is the preferred revascularization strategy, the off-pump technique might reduce the risk of acute kidney injury[15].

 On the other hand, cardiac scores, including EuroSCORE and STS, have been developed to predict the risk of adverse outcomes following surgery.

 Frailty, an independent predictor of mortality and complications, is not included in these risk algorithms.

 Emerging evidence suggests that frailty is a better marker of biological age and more important than chronological age[16,17].

 Afilalo et al.

[18] determined that patients with slow preoperative gait speed (6 s to walk 5 m) had a 2 to 3 fold increased risk of mortality and major morbidity for any given level of STS-Predicted Risk of Mortality or Major Morbidity (PROM) compared with normal speed.

 Gait speed added to STS-PROM marginally increased model performance from 0.

70 (0.

60-0.

80) to 0.

74 (0.

64-0.

84).

 Forty-three percent of patients died or sustained a major complication assessed as high STS-PROM risk (15%) together with slow gait speed, compared with 21.

7% low STS risk with slow gait and 18.

9% high STS risk with normal gait.

 Afilalo et al.

[19] subsequently evaluated the prognostic value of various frailty, disability and cardiac risk scores to identify the optimal combination to predict adverse outcome.

 Patients with slow gait speed and 3 impairments on the Nagi disability scale predicted in-hospital morbidity and mortality above that of the Parsonnet cardiac risk score (AUC 0.

76 vs.

 0.

72 with Parsonnet score alone).

 Lee et al.

[20] performed a retrospective review of a large cardiac registry, comparing outcomes between non-frail and frail individuals (coded as having deficiencies in the activities of daily living, need for walking aids or diagnosis of dementia).

 Frailty was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.

8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.

1-3.

0; P=0.

03) and mortality at 2 years (risk-adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 1.

5, 95% CI 1.

1-2.

2; P=0.

01).

The benefits of CABG without cardiopulmonary bypass in pre-frail and frail patients are still undetermined.

 In conclusion, frailty is defined as a geriatric syndrome of impaired resiliency to stressors (such as cardiac surgery) that has been delineated recently in the cardiovascular literature.

 However, the benefits of CABG without cardiopulmonary bypass in these patients are still undetermined.

 We believe OPCAB remains an important technique for the improvement of coronary surgery.

 The biggest question right now is whether pre-frail and frail patients will benefit more from off-pump or on-pump CABG.

 The aim of this paper was to describe the FRAGILE trial protocol which intends to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients; we will conduct a multicenter prospective RCT comparing off-pump versus on-pump CABG in frail patients.

 Off-pump Versus On-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Frail Patients@highlight

Introduction: Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer and healthier lives.

 Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery.

 When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients.

 Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in patients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress.

 In this study, the authors introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial "FRAGILE", to be developed in the main cardiac surgery centers of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in frail patients.

 Methods: FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually randomized (1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded outcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), which aims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump versus on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients.

 Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention.

 Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic shock, new onset of atrial fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation for bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay in hospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of complete revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery, quality of life after cardiac surgery and costs.

 Discussion: FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to conventional on-pump CABG in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frail patients.
