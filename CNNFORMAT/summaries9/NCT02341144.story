(fifthQuint)Percutaneous Rectus Sheath Block Versus Intra-operative Rectus Sheath Block for Pediatric Umbilical Hernia Repair.

 Regional anesthesia has been increasingly utilized for providing post-operative analgesia for a number of surgical procedures in children.

 Rectus sheath block and local anesthetic infiltration of the surgical site are two common modes for providing post-operative analgesia following umbilical hernia repair.

 Studies comparing the two modes have shown ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block to improve immediate pain scores and reduce use of post-operative analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair.

 However, these studies have compared pre-incisional ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block to post-operative local anesthetic infiltration as a subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection.

 The purpose of the investigators' study is to compare the efficacy of pre-incisional percutaneous rectus sheath block to intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct visualization prior to closure of the skin for providing post-operative analgesia following umbilical hernia repair in children.

 The investigators propose a prospective study where pediatric patients who are undergoing elective umbilical hernia repair will be randomized pre-operatively to receive either pre-incisional, ultrasound guided percutaneous rectus sheath block or intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct visualization prior to closure of the skin.

 The primary outcome is the post-operative pain rating based on the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) following umbilical hernia repair.

 Additional outcomes measured will include: operative times, the use of intravenous/oral opioid and/or non-opioid medication in the post-operative period, duration of analgesia following surgery based on time to first rescue analgesic, intra-operative hemodynamic changes, post-operative hemodynamic changes, incidence of side-effects, and complications.

 Patients/patient guardians will receive a sheet to document post-operative WBFPRS scores, oral opioid and non-opioid medication administration once discharged to home for a total of 5 days.

 Percutaneous Rectus Sheath Block Versus Intra-operative Rectus Sheath Block for Pediatric Umbilical Hernia Repair@highlight

This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of pre-incisional percutaneous rectus sheath block to intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct visualization prior to closure of the incision for providing post-operative analgesia following umbilical hernia repair in children.

 The current management for reducible umbilical hernias is umbilical hernia repair under general anesthesia as an outpatient procedure.

 Patients aged 3-18 years old with a diagnosis of umbilical hernia will be screened for study inclusion.

 Eligible patients and their parents/guardians will be approached and, if agreeable, consented for the study pre-operatively.

 Patients will be randomized to receive either pre-incisional percutaneous rectus sheath block by the anesthesiologist or intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct visualization prior to closure of the skin incision by the surgeon.

 The patient, patient guardians, select research team members, and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) staff will be blinded to the method of analgesic administration.
