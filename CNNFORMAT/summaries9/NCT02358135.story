(fifthQuint)Collaborative Connected Health (CCH) for PCORI.

 The investigators propose to conduct a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a collaborative connected health model for psoriasis management compared to inperson care.

 The pragmatic trial will compare psoriasis severity, quality-of-life, mental health, and access-to-care between the two models.

 We will enroll 300 psoriasis patients from Colorado and California.

 In addition to recruiting patients from the general population, we will place a specific emphasis on recruiting psoriasis patients living in rural and underserved communities.

 We will also recruit from the full disease spectrum of mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients.

 We will use an intention-to-treat approach to analyze outcomes and perform longitudinal data analysis using repeated measures approach to identify potential differences in the trend over time between the two arms.

 To evaluate the utility of CCH for increasing access from patients' and clinicians' perspective, the study team will conduct key informant interviews and use qualitative analytical techniques with investigator triangulation and member checking to enhance the validity of the conclusions.

 Collaborative Connected Health (CCH) for PCORI@highlight

The investigators propose to evaluate whether an innovative collaborative connected health (CCH) model increases access to specialists and improves patient outcomes.

 CCH offers multiple modalities for patients and primary care providers (PCPs) to access dermatologists online directly and asynchronously to maximize effectiveness in a real-world setting.

 CCH also fosters team care and patient engagement through active sharing of management plans and multidirectional, informed communication among patients, PCPs, and dermatologists.

 The specific aims of the proposal are to (1) determine whether the CCH model results in equivalent improvements in psoriasis disease severity compared to in-person care, (2) determine whether the CCH model results in equivalent improvements in quality of life and mental health compared to in-person care, and (3) assess whether the CCH model provides better access to care than in-person care.
