(secondQuint)Chronotropic Incompetence Diagnostic Algorithm in Heart Failure Patients.

 The Investigation of the Chronotropic Incompetence Diagnostic Algorithm in Heart Failure Patients (CI Algorithm Study) is an acute data collection study using market released actigraphy devices (wGT3X-BT) and holter devices (DR 180) to measure study subjects' daily activities and surface ECG data simultaneously.

 The data will be analyzed to develop an algorithm to diagnose CI in patients with HF.

 Chronotropic Incompetence Diagnostic Algorithm in Heart Failure Patients@highlight

This study is to collect human activity and ECG data from heart failure (HF) patients to aid in the development of a novel chronotropic incompetence (CI) algorithm designed to diagnose CI in patients with HF.
