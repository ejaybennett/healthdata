(fifthQuint)rTMS: A Treatment to Restore Function After Severe TBI.

 The specific aims (SA) of the CDMRP study are: SA-1: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS induced neurobehavioral effects using the DRS (lower scores indicate more function).

 SA-2: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS-induced changes in functional neural activation and whether these changes correlate with improving neurobehavioral function.

 SA-3: To determine the rTMS effect on white fiber tracts and whether rTMS-related effects correlate with neurobehavioral gains.

 White fiber tracts will be examined according to changes in Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Axial Diffusivity (AD).

 SA-4: To confirm rTMS safety for severe TBI.

 The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between active and placebo groups according to average number of research related adverse events (AE) during treatment.

 To accomplish these aims, the investigators will conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial where 58 persons remaining in states of disordered consciousness for 3 to 12 months after TBI are randomized to the active rTMS group or the placebo rTMS group.

 The primary outcome is neurobehavioral recovery slope as measured by the total Disability Rating Scale (DRS), which will be collected weekly at bedside between Endpoints 1 (15th rTMS Session) and 2 (30th rTMS Session).

 The DRS will be collected weekly via telephone interview for the three weeks between Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3 (3 weeks after 30th rTMS session).

 Secondary outcomes include four measures of functional neural activation: task related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), EEG-Rest and EEG-Task.

 The functional neural activation measures will be collected at baseline, Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3.

 Motor Threshold Testing and Neurobehavioral measures in addition to the DRS and physical measures will also be collected as secondary outcomes.

 Motor Threshold testing, neurobehavioral and physical measures will be collected at baseline, Endpoint 1, Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3.

 The additional Neurobehavioral and physical measures are the Disorders of Consciousness Scale-25 (DOCS-25), Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R), Coma Near Coma Scale (CNC), Modified Tardieu Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Spaulding Limb Movement Protocol and the Consciousness Screening Algorithm.

 rTMS: A Treatment to Restore Function After Severe TBI@highlight

The purpose of this study is to address the need for targeted treatments that induce functional and structural changes in the brain, ultimately improving neurobehavioral functioning, the investigators propose examining the therapeutic effectiveness of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).

 The objective is to improve functional recovery for persons remaining in vegetative (VS) and minimally conscious (MCS) states 3 to 12 months after severe TBI.

 The approach is to determine the neurobehavioral effect of rTMS, the relationship between neurobehavioral changes and net neural effects, and to identify and define the neural mechanisms related to neurobehavioral improvements by providing 30 active or placebo rTMS sessions.
