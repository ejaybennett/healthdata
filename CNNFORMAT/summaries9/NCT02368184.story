(secondQuint)Pilot Study of the CoVa Monitoring of Patients With Congestive Heart Failure.

 The study proposes to utilize the CoVa cent Monitoring System, a novel body-worn sensor that remotely monitors thoracic fluid, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, skin temperature, posture, and, using transmitted waveforms, stroke volume and cardiac output to evaluate the system's monitoring capabilities in individuals recently hospitalized for congestive heart failure.

 The data acquired through this study will play a critical roll in developing future interventional studies that will allow patients with HF to potentially receive better and more timely treatment in the home setting, decreasing hospitalizations and improving quality of life.
