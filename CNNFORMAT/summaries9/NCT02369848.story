(fifthQuint)Shockwave Lithoplasty DISRUPT Trial for PAD (DISRUPT PAD 2).

 Shockwave Medical, Inc.

 intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty cent System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.

50mm to 7.

0mm reference vessel diameter at the target site.

 The Shockwave Lithoplasty cent System is indicated for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy.

 Up to sixty (60) subjects will be enrolled at up to 8 centers in Europe and New Zealand to yield at least 51 evaluable subjects (assuming a lost-to-follow up rate of 15%).

 Subjects will be evaluated at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment/index procedure.

 Primary endpoints include safety and efficacy.

 Safety is a composite of new-onset Major Adverse Events through 30 days.

 Efficacy is target lesion patency at 12 months by duplex ultrasound defined as freedom from 50% restenosis.

Shockwave Medical, Inc.

 intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty cent System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.

50mm to 7.

0mm reference vessel diameter at the target site.

 The Shockwave Lithoplasty cent System is indicated to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure.

 Up to sixty (60) subjects will be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty to yield thirty (51) evaluable subjects complete the study assuming a 15% lost to follow-up rate.
