(firstQuint)A Study to Investigate the Effect of Food on Pharmacokinetics of Total EPA and Total DHA of AZD0585 in Healthy Male Japanese Subjects.

 This study is an open-label, randomized, cross-over design with three single-dose treatment periods and a washout of at least 10 days in between each treatment visit.

 The study period consists of 5 visits to the study centre: Visit 1 (enrolment), Visit 2 (first single-dose treatment), Visit 3 (second single-dose treatment), Visit 4 (third single-dose treatment) and Visit 5 (follow-up).

 Target subject population is healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20-45 years.

 Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 4 g AZD0585 will be administered on 3 separate occasions (fasting, before meal, and after meal) in a randomized crossover fashion with different food restrictions.
