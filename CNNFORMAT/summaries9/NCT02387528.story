 HYPOTHESIS A mindfulness-based intervention in professionals in primary health care is associated with decreased levels of burnout, and increased levels of psychological well-being.

 OBJECTIVES Check the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention for primary health care professionals in Porto Alegre-RS, evaluating the behavior of a questionnaire for clinical subtypes of burnout (BCSQ-36) and other variables of psychological well-being, depression and anxiety symptons, activity and sleep patterns, from a randomized controlled study and also check the convergence between clinical types of burnout that constitute BCSQ-36 in relation to other measures of psychological well-being (mindfulness, resilience, acceptance, affection, self-esteem, commitment and compassion).

 DELINEAMENT: Randomized clinical trial.

 Outcome: Modification of clinical subtypes of burnout (BCSQ-36) and other variables of psychological well-being, depression and anxiety symptons, activity and sleep patterns, after training in mindfulness meditation in comparing to prior levels.

 Factor: Training in mindfulness meditation.

 Sampling: The sample will be composed of health professionals working in primary care, which will be recruited voluntarily with the various family health strategies (FHS) and basic health units (BHU) in the city of Porto Alegre - RS.

 The number of participants needed for the study has adequate power, was defined from the literature review.

 Thus, 60 participants will be recruited and randomized into two groups: control group (CG) + Intervention Group (IG).

 Each of the groups will be composed by two or three subgroups, in order to form suitable and manageable size groups for the intervention.

 Thus, interventions for each group will start as soon as subgroups of approximately 15 participants are formed in each.

 Procedures: The complete experimental protocol will last approximately 8 months.

 Initially, a contact was made with the management of primary health care system with the aim to present the methodology and the research objectives, having then the accent to proceed.

 Professionals will be invited to the research project through an introductory lecture that lasts an hour.

 In the lecture the components of evidence based Mindfulness interventions will be included, followed by the presentation of research.

 Interested volunteers will be instructed about the purposes and procedures of the research, as well as on the existence of two groups, one that receive the Mindfulness intervention immediately, and other that will remain on the waiting list, with the possibility of receiving Mindfulness training after the end of the study.

 After clarification, those who agree to participate in the research will sign the Consent Form (CF).

 After signing the consent form, volunteers will be evaluated by a clinical interview, to verify eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria described above.

 Eligible to participate in the study will receive, in the same clinical evaluation , the first battery of questionnaires, consisting in the application of SRQ - 20 and SRQ-A .

 Participants who have the SRQ - 20 7 or SRQ - A 1 will be interviewed using the SCID DSM-IV, which is a structured diagnostic psychiatric interview.

 The 24-hour urine collect for measurement of sulphatoxymelatonin, and use of actigraph (which will record the sleep/wake cycle, as well as the incidence of light) will also occur at this time.

 After the first evaluation, the volunteers will be randomized for the two groups.

 The groups will be equated with control of age and gender.

 As soon as they form subgroups of approximately 15 volunteers the interventions will begin.

 Recruitment and screening of participants will continuate and the new groups will begin as new subgroups of approximately 15 participants are formed.

 The protocol of Mindfulness will be offered to the control group after the end of the study.

 The post-participation evaluations will occur for both groups immediately after the eight weeks interventions.

 It will be similar to the pre-participation evaluation, except for sociodemographic questionnaire.

 At the end of the study a qualitative evaluation with some participants in the intervention group will be held, as described above.

 Intervention Protocol: Mindfulness Protocol (intervention group).

 An intervention program integrating elements of Mindfulness Breathworks Institute Mindfulness based approaches for Pain and ilness (MBPI), (Burch , 2009) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), (Kabat Zinn, 2003), and Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) shall be used.

 All programs are highly structured, lasting eight weeks, with a weekly meeting about two hours , and working with four main techniques during these meetings : mindfulness in breathing, body scan, walking meditation and mindfulness yoga.

 In order to facilitate the home practice of meditation by participants during and after the intervention protocol, all will receive a CD containing guided meditation sessions, covering the above techniques.

 One of the researchers will be the instructor as she has completed the Teacher Training Program.

 The sessions duration was shortened to better fit the functioning and infrastructure services, comprising eight weekly sessions of an hour and a half each.

 All data collected in this study will be organized in the database in computational SPSS.

 Analysis of these data will be descriptive (absolute and relative frequencies, and total mean scores for each instrument and their measures of central tendency and dispersion for each evaluation point) and analytical, comparing the two groups in various stages of evaluation.

 The internal consistency of the instruments will be assessed by the coefficient of reliability or Alpha () Cronbach.

 Mindfulness, Burnout, Physical and Psychological Well-being of Primary Health Care Professionals@highlight

High demands put on workers nowadays have contributed for an increase on the vulnerability and the stress levels, with severe consequences for the health (Sandim, 2008).

 One of the main health conditions today is the Burnout Syndrome - or professional exhaustion (Salanova and Llorens, 2008), with harmful consequences for individuals and organizations.

 The level of dedication to the tasks in which the frustrations are faced more strongly can determine what type of burnout would be developed ( "frenetic", "under-challenged" or "worn-out"), affecting the health condition.

 In late 1970s, mindfulness began to be studied as a behavioral intervention in mental health.

 Current evidence suggests that the state / mental trait mindfulness is positively associated with a variety of mental health indicators.

 The potential applicability of mindfulness in health services is great.

 Besides the effects for patients, health professionals also can have benefits.

 The consensus is that a greater number of mental health interventions need to be evaluated and implemented and it is possible that mindfulness can fit this need as a new technology in health care.

 There is a gap in the literature on the relationship of different clinical types of burnout and its association with different psychological constructs related to health, particularly in relation to the mental state of mindfulness and, in particular , addressing health professionals.

 Better understand this association will enable the improvement of existing and development of new interventions, geared to the specific needs of the population of health professionals, especially for professionals of Primary Health Care (PHC) , the object of this study.

 Thus, the general objective of this study is to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention for primary health care professionals in the city of Porto Alegre, evaluating the behavior of a questionnaire for clinical subtypes of burnout (BCSQ -36), other variables of psychological well -being, depression and anxiety symptons, activity and sleep patterns, measuring before and after the intervention, from a randomized controlled trial.
