(fifthQuint)Efficacy of 30-day Duration of Fidaxomicin for Recurrent C.

 Difficile Infection.

 Clostridium difficile (C.

 difficile) infection (CDI) is one of the most frequent causes of healthcare associated infections and its rates are also growing in the community.

 The efficacy of standard antibiotics especially for recurrent CDI is limited as oral vancomycin and metronidazole also suppress the growth of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis group which protect against proliferation of C.

 difficile.

 In contrast, in vitro study has shown that fidaxomicin has negligible activity against B.

 fragilis.

 The persistent disruption of healthy colonic flora may be the reason for recurrences following a course of treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin.

 Fidaxomicin has shown to reduce recurrences by approximately 50% when compared to oral vancomycin for primary or 1st episode of recurrent CDI.

 Determining the efficacy and safety of 30-day duration of fidaxomicin for recurrent CDI through an open label clinical trial has important implications for policy making related to the drug reimbursement programs.

 In addition, the results of this study will be instrumental in demonstrating to the scientific and healthcare communities there may be a role for the 30-day course of fidaxomicin as a treatment modality for recurrent CDI.

 Curing CDI will restore the health and quality of life not just at the individual patient level but to the healthcare communities as well.

 Patients with refractory CDI require prolonged hospital admission, which increases the organism burden within the healthcare facilities.

 This in turn leads to the spread of the infection to other vulnerable patients.

 If a 30-day course of fidaxomicin proves to be safe and effective in curing patients with recurrent CDI, it will reduce the risk of severe complications in each patient and reduce transmission of CDI to other susceptible patients.

 Efficacy of 30-day Duration of Fidaxomicin for Recurrent C.

 Difficile Infection@highlight

This is a medical research study designed to look at the safety and efficacy of 30-day course of fidaxomicin for treatment of recurrent CDI (Clostridium difficile Infection).

 CDI is an infection that results when the normal flora (resident bacteria) of the colon is substantially altered by antibiotic treatment.

 The decrease in this normal flora allows for the growth of the C.

 difficile bacteria.

 Fidaxomicin is an antibiotic which is approved by Health Canada for treatment of CDI.

 Only patients with a primary case of CDI or 1st episode of recurrent CDI have been studied using a 10-day course of fidaxomicin.
