(fifthQuint)An Open-label Study of Lirilumab (BMS-986015) in Combination With 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) for the Treatment of Patients With Refractory/ Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study.

 Up to 5 groups of up to 6 participants will be enrolled in the lead-in phase of the study, and up to 40 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

 If you are enrolled in the lead-in phase, the dose of lirilumab and 5-azacytidine you receive will depend on when you joined this study.

 The first group of participants will receive the starting dose combination level.

 If intolerable side effects are seen, the next group may receive a lower dose level of lirilumab and/or 5-azacytidine.

 This will continue until the highest tolerable combination dose is found.

 If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive lirilumab and 5-azacytidine at the highest dose that was tolerated in the lead-in phase.

 Study Treatment: You will receive the study drugs in cycles that are about 28 days long.

 However, these cycles may be shorter or longer depending on if/how the disease responds to the treatment, how your bone marrow reacts to treatment, and what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest.

 On Days 1-7 of each study cycle, you will receive 5-azacytidine daily either by vein over about 1 hour or by an injection under the skin.

 It is possible that you will start receiving the drug one way and switch to the other if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 On Day 8 (+/- 2 days) of each cycle, you will also receive lirilumab by vein over about 1 hour.

 Your dose of 5-azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 Your dose of lirilumab may also be delayed if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 Though you will receive lirilumab at MD Anderson every time you receive it, it is possible that after the first 4 cycles you will be able to receive 5-azacytidine at a more convenient location to you.

 Talk to the study staff about receiving the drug at a local treatment center.

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

 During the first 3 cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time each week.

 After the first 3 cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests every 2-4 weeks.

 On Day 28 of Cycle 1 (+/- 7 days), then every 1-3 cycles after that, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

 You will have blood draws and/or bone marrow aspirations at any time that the doctor thinks it is needed while you are on study.

 After Cycle 1, you may be able to have study tests performed at a local clinic.

 Talk to the study staff about this option.

 Length of Study: It is planned that you may receive up to 24 cycles of the study drug, but it is possible that you may continue taking the study drug after this if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

 End-of-Study Visit: If you are taken off or if you leave the study before the end of Cycle 24, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.

 Follow-Up: You will be asked to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit with a physical exam about 30 days after you stop receiving the study drugs.

 If you cannot come to the clinic, you will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side effects and/or any new treatment(s).

 This call will last about 5 minutes.

 If you go off study for reasons other than the disease getting worse, you will be called for up to 90 days and asked about how you are doing.

 Each call should last about 5 minutes.

 An Open-label Study of Lirilumab (BMS-986015) in Combination With 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) for the Treatment of Patients With Refractory/ Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of the combination of lirilumab and 5-azacytidine that can be given to patients with AML or high-risk MDS.

 Researchers also want to learn if the drug combination can help to control the disease.

 The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 Lirilumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 5-azacytidine is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of MDS, which can lead to AML, but it has not been approved for the treatment of AML.

 The use of these drugs in combination is investigational.

 The study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work.

 Up to 64 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
