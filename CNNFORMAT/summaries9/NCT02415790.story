(fifthQuint)Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of E2027 in Healthy Adult and Elderly Subjects, and the Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Adult Subjects.

 The study will consist of 4 parts, Parts A, B, C, and D.

 Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical pharmacology for evaluation of safety, tolerability, and PK characteristics up to the MTD in healthy adult (greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 50 years old).

 In Part B, the PK and PD effects of E2027 on CSF cGMP are evaluated in healthy adult (greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 50 years old).

 Participants in 2nd cohort of Part B will participate in the evaluation of food effect in Treatment Period 2.

 In Part C, the design is similar to Part A.

 This healthy elderly cohort (greater than or equal to 65 years and less than or equal to 85 years old) will provide bridging PK, safety, and tolerability data on E2027 compared to younger healthy participants in Part A and Part B.

 Part D will be conducted in healthy Japanese adult participants (greater than or equal to 20 years and less than or equal to 50 years old) and is designed to bridge the PK, safety, and tolerability data of E2027 between Japanese and non-Japanese participants.

 All parts of the study will have 2 phases: the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase.

 The Prerandomization Phase will consist of a Screening Period and a Baseline Period during which each participant's study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.

 The Randomization Phase will consist of the Treatment Period and a Follow-Up Period.

 During the Treatment Period, participants will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of either E2027 or placebo matching E2027.

 Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of E2027 in Healthy Adult and Elderly Subjects, and the Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Adult Subjects@highlight

This first-in-human study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral ascending doses of E2027, will be administered to healthy adult participants to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

 Thereafter, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of single doses of E2027 on elevation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cyclic guanidine monophosphate (cGMP) in healthy adult participants will be evaluated across a broad dose range, to establish the PK/PD relationship.
