(fifthQuint)Pre-operative Very Low-calorie Protein-based Versus Hypocaloric Enteral Nutrition.

 Bariatric surgery is an important treatment strategy for obese patients having failed multiple diet-induced weight loss attempts.

 On the other hand, severly obese patients have also a high risk of both intra- and post-operative complications.

 Pre-operative weight loss can reduce these risks but no optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been investigated.

 Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic improvements in the short-term than balanced, hypocaloric diets.

 Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate whether a VLCD results in lower intra-and post-operative complications compared to a hypocaloric diet.

 However, to achieve a optimal compliance in patients having experienced multiple dietary intervention failures, administration of the intervention will be performed by the enteral route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.
