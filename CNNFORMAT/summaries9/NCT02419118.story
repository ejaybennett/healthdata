(thirdQuint)"Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 Emphasis on the CD38 Antibody Daratumumab ".

 The effector mechanisms of daratumumab have been extensively studied in vitro, but the in vivo correlates and key determinants of success or failure when daratumumab is used alone or in combination with lenalidomide for treatment of patients with myeloma have not been clarified.

 There is potentially a wide spectrum of factors that may influence the quality and duration of response following treatment with daratumumab.

 The integrity of the patient's immune system may be important.

 Prior lines of chemotherapy or the myeloma disease itself may impair humural (i.

e.

 complement) or cellular (i.

e.

 ADCC) effector mechanisms that are of importance for the response to daratumumab.

 Also intrinsic properties of the tumor cells or interactions between myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment could make the myeloma cells refractory to daratumumab.

 A better understanding of these variables may enable us to improve the quality and duration of daratumumab-induced responses and make daratumumab-based therapies more effective in the near future.

 "Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 Emphasis on the CD38 Antibody Daratumumab "@highlight

Daratumumab is a new treatment for patients with myeloma.

 While many patients benefit from this treatment some do not and the mechanism(s) of failure are poorly understood.

 This study aims to clarify aspects of resistance to treatment with daratumumab in order to improve patient outcomes in the future.
