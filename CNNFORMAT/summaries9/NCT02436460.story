(thirdQuint)A Study of AbGn-168H in Patients With Steroid Refractory Acute Graft-vs-Host Disease After Donor Stem Cell Transplant.

 AbGn-168H is a humanized monoclonal antibody.

 This is a dose escalation study using a modified toxicity probability interval method.

 AbGn-168H will be administered intravenously (IV) once weekly for four weeks, in patients with steroid refractory aGVHD following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.

The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety, and the secondary objectives of this study are to determine if there is an improvement in disease response at 3 months after diagnosis of steroid refractory aGVHD compared to historical cohorts and to determine the changes in frequency and/or phenotype of aGVHD-associated T cell clones in response to AbGn-168H therapy.

This study is to establish the safety, determine if there is an improvement in steroid refractory acute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) compared to historical cohorts, and determine the changes of aGvHD-associated T-cell clones in patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation administered AbGn-168H once weekly for 4 weeks.
