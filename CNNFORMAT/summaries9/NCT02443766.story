(thirdQuint)Use of a Functional Neuroimaging Battery for the Evaluation of a Meditation Retreat.

 This study will utilize DaTscan single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects within one month of entering the retreat.

 The study uses DaTscan to measure the effect on serotonin and dopamine transporter binding, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the effect on cerebral blood flow.

 The Ignatian Retreat is a weeklong retreat which involves meditation and prayer.

 Additionally, study participants will complete a variety of questionnaires and scales to measure psychological and spirituality states.

 The scans and questionnaires will be completed before and after the participant has completed the retreat.

 The ultimate goal of the study is to analyze and compare pre and post imaging and neuropsychological and spirituality changes in healthy controls who participate in this retreat.

 Use of a Functional Neuroimaging Battery for the Evaluation of a Meditation Retreat@highlight

Over 2 decades scientists have been studying the effect on brain function from meditation practices.

 The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of a meditation retreat program on serotonin and dopamine transporter binding and changes in cerebral blood flow.

 The retreat program that will be followed is a week-long retreat called the Ignatian Retreat.
