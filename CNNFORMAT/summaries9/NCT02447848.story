(firstQuint)Open-Label Safety and Efficacy of the Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet 30 mcg for Acute Pain.

 The study is a multicenter, open-label trial, in patients 18 years and older, who present to the ER with moderate-to-severe acute pain due to obvious trauma or injury evident on physical examination.

 Upon meeting all entrance criteria, patients will be administered up to four doses of sufentanil 30 mcg and remain in the study for 5 hours for safety and efficacy measurements.

 Safety will be monitored via periodic measurement of vital signs and continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, as well as assessment of adverse events (AEs) and the use of concomitant medications.

 Efficacy will be assessed by patient reports of pain intensity (PI) and pain relief.

 A Six-Item Screener (SIS) will be administered before and 1 hour after study drug administration to measure cognitive impairment.

 The Patient Global Assessment (PGA) and the Healthcare Professional Global Assessment (HPGA) will assess global satisfaction with the method of pain control.
