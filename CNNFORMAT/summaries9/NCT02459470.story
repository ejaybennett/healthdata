(secondQuint)Stroke Volume Variation and Pulse Pressure Variation as Predictors of Fluid Responsiveness During Kidney Transplantation.

 Optimal intraoperative fluid management guided by central venous pressure (CVP), a traditional intravascular volume status indicator has been established to improve transplanted graft function during renal transplantation.

 Recently, stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV), dynamic preload indices derived from the arterial waveform are increasingly advocated as predictors of fluid responsiveness in anesthetized patients and critically ill patients.

 However, their usefulness in renal failure patients undergoing renal transplantation has not been investigated.

 Thus, the aims of this study is to investigate accuracy of SVV and PPV for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing kidney transplantation.
