(firstQuint)Bioequivalence Study of Synflutide HFA Inhaler and Seretide Evohaler in Healthy Volunteers Without Charcoal Block.

 A pivotal, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, crossover, comparative bioavailability study for test drug Synflutide HFA 250/25 Inhaler and reference drug SeretideTM 250 EvohalerTM in healthy volunteers without charcoal block.

 Fifty healthy, male and female volunteers, 20-65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) within 18.

0-30.

0 kg/m2, inclusive, will be enrolled.

 A single dose of 4 puffs (eq.

 to fluticasone propionate 10001/2g+salmeterol 1001/2g from valve) in each study period.

 Plasma samples will be assayed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol using a validated analytical method according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.
