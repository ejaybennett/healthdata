(thirdQuint)Preoperative Inspiratory Muscle Training in Gastroplasty.

 The prevalence of obesity has a significantly increase in recent years and represents a public health problem due to the increased risk of mortality from various causes.

 Changes in respiratory system arising from obesity are well established and they include a reduction in compliance with an increased ventilatory work and oxygen consumption with breathing.

 Bariatric surgery is an alternative surgical treatment of obesity and patients who undergo this surgery are susceptible to post operative pulmonary complications as a result of obesity and also abdominal surgery.

 The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) used in pre or post operative period can improve muscle strength and endurance, beyond the perception of dyspnea.

There are suggestions that the preoperative training may contribute to a best post operative evolution in patients, but these benefits are not clearly defined in the literature.

 The objective is to evaluate the effects of preoperative IMT in post operative patients undergoing gastroplasty.

 There will be 40 patients of bariatric surgery group in Ribeirao Preto Medical School of both sexes, BMI>40 kg/m2 and with the appropriate inclusion criteria.

They will be assessed by pulmonary function tests, measurement of strength and endurance of respiratory muscles, submaximal exercise tests, dyspnea and quality of life scales.

 All patients will receive standard treatment and will be randomly divided into two groups, named control group and training group, who will be trained for 4 weeks preoperatively.

 The patients will be reassessed after 4 weeks of training and on the 15th postoperative return day.

 The evolution data about pulmonary complications will be collected from the medical records, notes of the medical staff and physical therapy routine service.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of preoperative inspiratory muscle training in patients with grade III obesity undergoing bariatric surgery.

 It will be a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with volunteers allocated in two groups that will be compared according to postoperative evolution (pulmonary complications, lung function, strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles and respiratory system resistance).
