(fifthQuint)NAC, NaHCO3 and NS Prophylaxis for CTPA in the ED on Suspicion of PE: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Study Design and Setting This randomized, double blind, placebo control study was performed in the emergency department of a tertiary care university hospital in Turkey receiving >100,000 patient presentations annually.

 Approval was granted by the Karadeniz Technical University institutional ethical committee.

 Written and informed consent was received from all patients enrolled.

 The data collected period commenced on 1 February 2014, and the study period lasted for 1 year until 1 February 2015.

 Selection of Participants Patients undergoing contrast enhanced thoracic tomography due to suspected PE, aged over 18, with measureable basal creatinine levels pre-tomography and measurable serum creatinine levels 48-72 h post-tomography and with one or more of the risk factors for CIN cited below were enrolled.

 The risk factors were pre-existing renal dysfunction (Cre 1.

4 mg/dl or a high or calculated glomerular filtration rate 25% or 0.

5 mg/dl in creatinine levels 48-72 h after contrast exposure compared to basal levels) was evaluated as the primary outcome in the study.

 A secondary outcome was assessed as moderate renal injury developing during hospitalization (defined as a 100% increase in serum creatinine levels, severe renal failure requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or in-hospital mortality.

 Patients were monitored throughout hospitalization until either discharge or mortality.

 NAC, NaHCO3 and NS Prophylaxis for CTPA in the ED on Suspicion of PE: A Randomized Controlled Trial@highlight

Study objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the role of the prophylactic protocols N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus normal saline, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) plus normal saline and intravenous normal saline (NS) alone in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in emergency patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

 Materials and methods: This study was planned as randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical research.

 Patients presenting to the emergency department within a 1-year period, undergoing CTPA on suspicion of PE and having one or more risk factors for development of CIN were included in the study.

 The NAC group received 1 ml/3 mgr NAC+NS solution 1 h before CTPA and 1 ml/kg per hour for a minimum 6 h after CTPA.

 The NaHCO3 group received 132 mEq NaHCO3+NS solution for 1 h before CTPA and 1 ml/kg per hour for a minimum of 6h after CTPA.

 The normal saline (NS) group received 3 ml/kg NS for 1 h before CTPA and 1 ml/kg per hour NS for a minimum 6 h after CTPA.

 CIN was evaluated as the primary outcome, and moderate renal injury (defined as a 100% increase in serum creatinine levels), severe renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or in-hospital mortality as secondary outcomes.
