(fifthQuint)Biomarkers of Neuropathic Pain in Women Treated for Breast Cancer.

 This cohort is part of a previous prospective study of 1000 breast cancer operated women.

 Of these, there are 350 patients with surgeon defined intercostobrachial nerve resection during the operation.

 Part of the patients have pain, part of them are pain free.

 In addition the investigators plan to enroll 50 patients with pain, but no nerve resection during operation.

 The patients come for a clinical research visit.

 Beforehand they fill in questionnaires of medical history, pain, mood, temperament, quality of life, and sleeping.

 After informed consent the patients give a blood sample with prior 12 hour fasting.

 The investigators present a detailed sensory testing with body maps and patient pain drawings.

 The investigators perform a cold water test with autonomic nervous system monitoring and conduct a set of cognitive tests, part of them computer based.

 A selected group of patients undergo QST.

 Biomarkers of Neuropathic Pain in Women Treated for Breast Cancer@highlight

Investigators aim to identify the key phenotypes (biological, psychological, genetic) involved in the transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain (NP) by comparison of the neuropathic pain phenotypes and genomics of patients developing NP or not under similar nerve injury conditions.

 The cohort is part of a previous prospective study of 1000 patients operated for breast cancer of whom 350 have surgeon defined intercostobrachial nerve resection during operation with or without persistent pain and additional 50 patients with pain, but no nerve resection during operation.

 Patients fill in questionnaires and a detailed sensory examination, cognitive tests, and a cold water test with autonomic nervous system monitoring are performed during the research visit.

 A selected group of patients undergo quantitative sensory testing (QST).
