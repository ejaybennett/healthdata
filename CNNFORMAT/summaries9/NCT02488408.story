(thirdQuint)A Phase Ib/II Multicenter Open-label Study of BGB324 in Patients With AML or MDS.

 This study is a dose-escalation of BGB324, an Axl kinase inhibitor, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), followed by a cohort expansion study of BGB324 either as a single agent in patients with AML or MDS, or in combination with cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) or decitabine in patients with AML.

 The study will run in Germany, Norway and the US and may enrol up to approximately 75 patients with AML or MDS.

 The study consists of a dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) of BGB324 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS (Part A) followed by a cohort expansion phase in up to four disease-specific cohorts (Part B).

 BGB324 will be administered orally according to a daily schedule, with the first three doses of Cycle 1 serving as a 'loading' dose.

 Each 21-day (three week) period will constitute 1 cycle of treatment.

 A Phase Ib/II Multicenter Open-label Study of BGB324 in Patients With AML or MDS@highlight

A Phase Ib/II multicentre open label study of BGb324 as a single agent in patients with AML or MDS or in a combination with cytarabine and decitabine in AML patients.

 BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein kinase receptor which is overexpressed in up to half of AML cases.
