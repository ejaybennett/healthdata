(fifthQuint)Oral Glutamine in Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

 INTRODUCTION Glutamine (GLN) is the most abundant free amino acid in the body, and commonly known as a non-essential amino acid due to the ability of most cells to produce it.

 It has many essential metabolic functions in the organism; it is an energy substrate for most cells (especially for enterocytes and lymphocytes), a precursor for nucleotide, glutamate, and (in particular) glutathione synthesis, and an important cellular antioxidant.

 It plays a central role in nitrogen transport within the body, and is the most important substrate for renal ammoniagenesis.

 Studies have demonstrated that the presence of GLN in the medium regulates glutamine synthetase expression via a post-transcriptional mechanism, where the rate of glutamine synthetase protein degradation is diminished and its activity, augmented, in the presence of low GLN concentration.

 This amino acid modulates immune cell function and production of cytokines via attenuation of multiple pathways of inflammation, such as Nuclear Factor kB (NF-kB), protein kinases, inhibition of increases in Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) expression.

 It has been shown to be beneficial for the metabolically stressed patient, especially the critically ill patients.

 During acute illnesses, patients experience nutritional depletion, which correlates with low plasma and low mucosal GLN concentrations.

 GLN levels are significantly decreased in critical illness, leading to an increase in infectious complications, organ failure and mortality.

 Moreover, in cases of ischemia/reperfusion injury, GLN increases the myocardial ATP/ADP ratio and prevents intracellular lactate accumulation.

 GLN has been shown to be a key nutrient in the body's response to stress and injury described in multiple studies with in vitro and in vivo myocardial injury following I/R.

 These include enhanced myocardial glutathione, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glutamate (a major stress substrate for the stressed myocardium) post-I/R injury, and induction of heat shock proteins, especially Heat Shock Protein-70 (HSP-70) in critically ill patients.

 The stress tolerance provided by HSP-70 can protect against cellular injury, lung injury, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and septic shock, by the GLN influences on the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis modulation, and the integrity of gut barrier.

 Protection of the myocardium following ischemia and reperfusion injury is crucial in the perioperative management of patients after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

 This ischemia is the most important factor of reversible perioperative risk for cardiovascular complications.

 Patients undergoing CPB with a heart-lung machine (termed cardiopulmonary bypass) are at an increased risk of having abnormal "inflammation" in their body after surgery.

 Such inflammation can contribute to slower recovery from surgery, an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of damage to organs other than the heart, and a more complicated course.

 Numerous experimental and clinical trials have demonstrated the cardioprotective effects of GLN, including dose-dependent enhanced myocardial functional recovery following acute normothermic ischemia in the rat.

 GLN has also been shown to reduce infarct size to approximately 39% in a rabbit model following ischemia/reperfusion injury.

[19] GLN treatment also increased load tolerance in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD).

 In 2012, a clinical study observed a significant decrease in TROP-I in patients with ischemic heart disease who underwent CPB with extracorporeal circulation who received (0.

4 g/kg of GLN, Dipeptiven solution) one day before surgery.

 The case group (n=25) showed reduced levels of TROP-I compared to control group (1.

2 ng/ml to 2.

4 ng/ml), p=0.

035 on the first postoperative day.

 Also, the median cardiac index and median stroke index were higher in case group following CPB, improving myocardial function.

 In another study, the authors observed significantly decreased TROP-I levels in their pilot-clinical trial.

 They performed an oral intervention in patients undergoing CPB, giving 25 g twice of GLN supplement.

 TROP-I levels were significantly lower at 24, 48, and 72 postoperatively hours (all p standard deviations.

 To compare quantitative variables in the the results between the two groups, the U Mann Whitney test was used.

 Qualitative variables were measured using Chi 2 of Fisher's exact test in any expected values below 5.

 A p value of 0.

05 or less was considered significant.

 The analysis was performed using Excel 2013 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 for Windows (IBM Corp.

, NY, USA).

 Ethical Considerations The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Health Research in Mexico.

 The protocol was approved by the Local Committee on Health Research.

 Oral Glutamine in Cardiopulmonary Bypass@highlight

Introduction: Glutamine (GLN) is the most abundant free amino acid in the body.

 It modulates immune cell function and is an important energy substrate for most cells (especially for enterocytes and lymphocytes) in critical patients.

 GLN levels significantly decreased during sepsis/critical illness leading to an increase in infectious complications, organ failure and mortality.

 Moreover, in cases of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the myocardium, GLN increases the levels of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio and prevents intracellular lactate accumulation.

 Recently, the perioperative effect of intravenous and oral GLN treatment been associated in lowering levels of cardiac injury markers such as Troponin-I (TROP-I) and the number of postoperative complications in patients who underwent Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB).

 The aim of the study was to analyze the oral dose of preoperative oral GLN treatment in patients who underwent CPB with extracorporeal circulation in Mexican patients.
