(fifthQuint)Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG in Healthcare Workers.

 We aim to deduct the seroprevalence of healthcare-personnel (HCP) who had participated in treatment of confirmed patients of Middle-East respiratory syndrome.

 In first step, we collected the base-line (pre-exposure) serum from the HCP who worked in the hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated.

 Pre-exposure serum was collected in a few centers.

 If the serum was drawn within 3 weeks from initial exposure, then the serum was considered adequate as pre-exposure.

 (Because, antibody against the MERS-CoV would be produced after more the 17-21 days of exposure).

 The serum was frozen.

 In second step, we will collect the post-exposure serum from the HCP who worked in the hospitals in which confirmed MERS patients were treated or detected.

 We plan to include 25-30 centers.

 The timing of sample collection is 6-8 weeks after last contact with confirmed MERS patients.

 The serum will also freeze.

 In third step, we will assay the presence of antibody in collected sample.

 We will use MERS-CoV ELISA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.

) as screening test and MERS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUNE co.

) as confirm test.

 Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG in Healthcare Workers@highlight

The investigators aim to do serosurvey of healthcare-personnel who had participated in treatment of confirmed patients of Middle-East respiratory syndrome.

 The investigators collected the base-line (pre-exposure) serum of healthcare-personnel in a few centers, and will collect the post-exposure serum from about 25-30 centers in which confirmed MERS patients had been treated.

 The investigators will deduct the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG among the healthy healthcare-personnel, and calculate the sero-conversion rate if possible.

 The investigators will subdivided the seroprevalence according to the degree of exposure and preparedness of personal protective equipment.
