(secondQuint)Monocentric Study on Acetabulum Patient-specific Pin Drilling Guides.

 Background: The Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide(ACOG) System from MATERIALISE NV was developed and is intended to be used as a surgical instrument to assist in the positioning of acetabular cup components intra-operatively using anatomical landmarks of the pelvis that are clearly identifiable on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging scans.

 Use of ACOG is a relative new technique.

 ACOG, based on CT imaging data, fit directly into the patient's anatomy and enable primary total hip replacement .

 Data showing extra benefit of this technique compared to conventional THR technique are not widely available.

 Aim: To determine the safety of this new surgical technique compared to conventional THR.

 Methods: 30 participants will be randomized to 2 groups.

 One group will be operated for a THR with the conventional technique and the other group will be operated for a THR with the assistance of the ACOG System.

 CT imaging will be taken pre and post operatively to measure cup orientation.

A prospective, interventional, monocentric, controlled and randomized study will compare a conventional surgical technique to a surgical technique with the assistance of the Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide (ACOG, Materialise) System during total hip replacement (THR).
