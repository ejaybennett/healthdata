(fifthQuint)Pharmacokinetics and Safety of rFVIIIFc Manufactured at 15,000 L (15K) Scale.

 PK assessments are in 3 phases: Pharmacokinetic Assessment 1(PK1): PK assessments following single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 2K scale.

 Pharmacokinetic Assessment 2 (PK2): PK assessments are made following a single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial or 6000 IU/vial strengths.

 Pharmacokinetic Assessment 3 (PK3): PK assessments are made following 13 weeks of rFVIIIFc treatment manufactured at the 15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial or 6000 IU/vial strengths.

 After study completion, in countries where rFVIIIFc is not commercially available, eligible participants will be offered enrollment into a long-term safety and efficacy extension study (8HA01EXT [NCT01454739]).

 Pharmacokinetics and Safety of rFVIIIFc Manufactured at 15,000 L (15K) Scale@highlight

The primary objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) of recombinant coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) manufactured at the current scale of 2000 L (2K) to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15,000 L (15K) scale in previously treated participants with severe hemophilia A.

 The secondary objectives are: to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at the 15K baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment; to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at 1000 IU/vial and 6000 IU/vial strengths; and to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale.
