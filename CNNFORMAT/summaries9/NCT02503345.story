(secondQuint)Evaluate the Effect of ALLN-177 in Reducing Urinary Oxalate in Patients With Hyperoxaluria and Kidney Stones.

 This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of ALLN 177 compared with placebo in reducing the urinary excretion of oxalate in subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria and kidney stones.

 ALLN-177 is an orally administered form of oxalate decarboxylase.

 The goal of therapy with ALLN-177 is to reduce urinary oxalate excretion by decreasing the absorption of oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract.

 Eligible subjects will be randomized to 7 days of treatment with a dose ALLN-177 or placebo and following a washout period, crossed over to an alternate treatment.

 Urinary oxalate excretion will be assessed by 24-hr urine collections throughout the study.

 The study allows for up to 60 subjects.
