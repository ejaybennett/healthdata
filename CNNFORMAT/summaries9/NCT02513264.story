(fifthQuint)Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2.

 The overall goal of the Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) is to create a database of participants who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) clinical research studies.

 The registry will provide an avenue to assess various asthma and allergy characteristics, which will result in more efficient recruitment for current and future ICAC protocols.

 Potential participants will be recruited via telephone or in person.

 Those deemed potentially eligible for a current protocol or protocol in development may be invited to the clinic for further data collection and assessments.

 This registry allows flexibility in selecting the eligibility criteria and data collection to match planned or upcoming ICAC protocols.

 At each stage of data collection, participants may be discontinued, put on hold, or invited to participate in further screening activities, depending on the likelihood that they will qualify for a future protocol.

 Participants may opt to withdraw their information or discontinue from the registry at any time, in person, by telephone, or in writing.

 Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2@highlight

There is a need for people to take part in research studies to learn more about diseases and how to treat them.

 The Registry for Asthma Characterization and Recruitment 2 (RACR2) will create a database of participants with asthma and nasal allergies, or risk factors for these conditions, who are potentially eligible for future Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) trials.

 The registry database will include assessments of various asthma and allergy characteristics to achieve a more efficient, selective recruitment of these participants for other protocols.
