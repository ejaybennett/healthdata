(fifthQuint)CRT-Guanfacine for SPD.

 This study proposes to 1) evaluate the effects of 7.

5 weeks of twice weekly cognitive remediation sessions, combined with concurrent administration of 8 weeks of guanfacine/placebo, on performance on cognitive, functional, and social skills performance measures in a sample of SPD patients with proven deficits in these areas.

 2) Compare the effect of cognitive remediation therapy + 8 weeks guanfacine with cognitive remediation therapy + placebo on cognition in this schizophrenia spectrum disorder population.

 3) Further characterize cognitive impairment in SPD using specific tests of working memory to evaluate the relationship between working memory and functional and social skill outcomes in this population.

 The study hypothesizes that: 1.

 While both groups (those receiving CRT + guanfacine or CRT +placebo) will demonstrate improvements in overall cognitive functioning, SPD participants receiving CRT + guanfacine will evidence greater increases in post-treatment performance on our primary outcome measures-MATRICS battery total score, AX-CPT, N-Back, PASAT and DOT Test- particularly in areas related to working memory.

 2.

 Participants receiving CRT + guanfacine will also demonstrate greater improvements in functional and social functioning exploratory measures, as evidenced by performance on our secondary assessments, the UPSA, SSPA, MASC, and Reading of the Mind in the Eyes.

 CRT-Guanfacine for SPD@highlight

This is a study to assess the efficacy augmenting cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) with a pharmacological agent for individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD).

 Impaired cognition, along with functional and social skill deficits, is a core feature of schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

 A better understanding of the cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenia-related conditions, as well as the identification of interventions that can reduce these impairments, are vital to improving outcomes for individual with these disorders.
