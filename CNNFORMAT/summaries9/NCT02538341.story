(secondQuint)Safety and Effectiveness of Live Zoster Vaccine in Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Users (VERVE Trial).

 Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as "shingles", is caused by reactivation and multiplication of the ubiquitous varicella zoster virus (VZV) that remains latent in everyone's sensory neurons following varicella, or "chickenpox".

 Among individuals who live to age 85, the lifetime risk for HZ is 50%, and more than one in five individuals affected by zoster develop post-herpetic neuralgia, resulting in chronic pain.

 Other serious complications include encephalitis, permanent vision loss, or more rarely, dissemination and death.

 Fortunately, a live attenuated vaccine is available and can reduce HZ risk by up to 70%.

 For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this vaccine has great potential to provide improved quality of life by reducing the incidence and complications associated with zoster.

 Due to the underlying disease and/or treatments (e.

g.

 steroids) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the risk of herpes zoster in RA patients is approximately double in the general population.

 This increased risk should make prevention of zoster and vaccination exceedingly important for RA patients.

 In fact, because of a higher overall absolute risk for zoster in RA, the vaccine yields a comparable or even greater absolute risk reduction to reduce the risk of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in an RA population as it does in the general population.

 However, the use of the zoster vaccine in RA patients is very low ( 20 mg/day.

 In light of 1) a substantial elevated HZ risk among RA patients; 2) national data showing most RA patients are not vaccinated for HZ; and 3) the high effectiveness of this vaccine in the general population, the investigators propose to conduct the Varicella zostER VaccinE (VERVE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and long-term effectiveness of the live herpes zoster vaccine.

 This study will recruit 1,000 individuals age 50 years or older currently receiving anti-TNF therapy for RA or other diseases.

 Within a relevant 6-week safety window, the investigators will collect serious adverse events (satisfying a regulatory definition of a SAE) including non-serious events of vaccine-strain varicella-like infection or herpes zoster.

 Beyond the key public health importance of the clinical question addressed, clinical trial methodological innovations anticipated for this unique large pragmatic trial.

 Additionally, the investigators will study vaccine tolerability and long-term effectiveness through a linkage to health plan data to allow for cost-effective follow-up while minimizing participant and study-site burden.

 Results from this study will facilitate the parent trial and change RA management by demonstrating the clinical safety and immunogenicity of the live zoster vaccine among current anti-TNF users.

 Rheumatologists and other providers will be able to improve the care, outcomes, and quality of life for patients using anti-TNF therapy, substantially decreasing the morbidity of herpes zoster and its complications over a lifetime.

 Safety and Effectiveness of Live Zoster Vaccine in Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Users (VERVE Trial)@highlight

The VaricElla zosteR VaccinE (VERVE) trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine, Zostavax, in patients over 50 years old with arthritis and other diseases who are using anti-TNF therapy and who have not previously received the vaccine.
