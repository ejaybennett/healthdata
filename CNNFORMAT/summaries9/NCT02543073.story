(thirdQuint)MSC for Treatment of Interstitial Lung Disease After Allo-HSCT.

 ILD is a group of diseases involving pulmonary interstitial, alveolar and (or) bronchioles.

 In the patients receiving allo-HSCT, ILD mainly present as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

 ILD after HSCT is characterized by non-responsiveness to treatment, leading to high morbidity and mortality.

 MSC has been considered as an effective treatment for refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), but the response to treat chronic GVHD (cGVHD), especially refractory BOS, is rarely reported.

 MSC for Treatment of Interstitial Lung Disease After Allo-HSCT@highlight

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the late pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) leading to high morbidity and mortality.

 At present, the treatment for ILD after allo-HSCT remains in discussion.

 In this study, the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined azithromycin as well as glucocorticoid as the treatment of ILD will be evaluated in the recipients of allo-HSCT.
