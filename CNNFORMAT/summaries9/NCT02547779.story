(fifthQuint)Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial in the Non-Medical Intensive Care Unit (SMART-SURG).

 SMART-SURG is a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial of 0.

9% saline versus physiologically-balanced isotonic crystalloids (Lactated Ringers or Plasma-Lyte(C) A) with regard to the incidence of major adverse kidney events by 30 days in patients admitted to non-medical intensive care units.

 All patients admitted to participating non-medical intensive care units at Vanderbilt University medical center who are 18 years or older will be enrolled.

 The study will occur in one-month blocks.

 Each participating ICU will be randomized to an initial fluid group (0.

9% saline or physiologically balanced isotonic crystalloids).

 The assigned fluid will be used exclusively for all patients receiving isotonic crystalloid for the duration of the month-long block (except in the presence of pre-specified contraindications).

 The assigned study fluid will switch at the end of each month-long block such that half of the months are assigned to 0.

9% saline and half of the months to physiologically balance fluid.

 The primary endpoint will be major adverse kidney events by 30 days (MAKE30 is the composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction at discharge).

 All aspects of study design, intervention, and data collection will be harmonized with an ongoing, independent study addressing the same question in the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University during a similar study period (SMART-MED).

 A pre-specified data analysis plan will dictate the harmonized analysis of SMART-MED and SMART-SURG.

 Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial in the Non-Medical Intensive Care Unit (SMART-SURG)@highlight

The administration of intravenous fluids is ubiquitous in the care of the critically ill.

 Commonly available isotonic crystalloid solutions contain a broad spectrum electrolyte compositions including a range chloride concentrations.

 Recent studies have associated solutions with supraphysiologic chloride content with hyperchloremia, metabolic acidosis and renal vasoconstriction, acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy, and increased mortality but no large, randomized-controlled trials have been conducted.

 SMART-SURG will be a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial enrolling critically ill patients from the non-medical ICUs at Vanderbilt University from October 2015 until April 2017.

 The primary endpoint will be the incidence of Major Adverse Kidney Events in 30 days after enrollment (MAKE30 is the composite of death, new renal replacement, or persistent renal dysfunction at discharge).
