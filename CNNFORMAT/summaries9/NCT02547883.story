(fifthQuint)Statins In The Elderly.

 Statins in primary prevention are associated with a 1.

2% decreased absolute risk of cardiovascular events in large randomized studies.

 Anyway, in patients 75 years, the impact of statins on mortality have not been demonstrated and large observational studies have shown an increased risk of mortality in people with low cholesterol.

 Moreover, statins are associated with numerous side effects, particularly in the elderly including myalgia and myositis, diabetes, cognitive disorders, fatigue and loss of energy and of physical activities, treatment interactions.

 At last, the cost of statins for the French national health insurance is 800 million euros per year (including around 200 million euros for people 75 years).

 The benefit/risk ratio of statins is not established in primary prevention in people 75 years, leading to numerous and discordant expert advices since no specific randomized trial have been conducted in this population.

 Thus, in patients 75 years treated with statins in primary prevention, the studied strategy will be to stop statin therapy.

 The comparison strategy will be represented by the group of patient who will continue their statin at the same dose.

 Patients will be followed up every three months, according to general recommendations, during 36 months.

 Clinical events will be prospectively registered.

 Statins In The Elderly@highlight

In patients 75 years, there is no evidence that statins in primary prevention are associated with a decreased mortality and recent US recommendations consider statins in people only between 40 and 75 years.

 Moreover, statins are associated with numerous side effects impacting quality of life of those people and represent a high cost for the French healthcare system.

 The aim of the present study is to evaluate cost/effectiveness ratio, in real life, of statin cessation in people 75 years treated in primary prevention.
