(firstQuint)LifePearl-Doxo Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study.

 This is a multicentre, prospective dose escalation/PK study, designed to assess the clinical performance of LifePearl cent beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the primary treatment of unresectable HCC by chemoembolization.

 Data from this study will be used as supportive data post CE-mark approval.

 The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of LifePearl cent beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer (HCC) by chemoembolization.

 This will be measured as treatment-related complications and plasma levels of Doxorubicin in peripheral blood.

 In addition, objective tumour response will be assessed by computed tomography or MRI.

 Two cohorts of patients will be evaluated: Cohort I to assess safety (dose escalation) and pharmacokinetic profile; Cohort II will assess pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy with the doxorubicin dose determined with Cohort I.
