(secondQuint)RCT of Paclitaxel DEB Compared to Standard PTA in Dialysis Fistula.

 Prospective multicenter randomized (1:1) Investigator Sponsored Trial, in which 150 consecutive patients candidates for percutaneous intervention of haemodialysis access will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: 1.

 Treatment Arm: paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) dilatation using the APERTO-balloon 2.

 Control Arm: standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).

 The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) for the reduction of restenosis in haemodialysis shunts compared to standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).
