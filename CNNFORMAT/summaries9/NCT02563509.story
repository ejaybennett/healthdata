(secondQuint)Reconstitution of HIV-specific Immunity Against HIV.

 The research aims at establishing a new treatment strategies of HIV.

 It will significantly improve the clinical therapy effects and effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality by reconstituting the immune systems of HIV infected patients and combining multiple therapy strategies.

 Therefore, the research could develop an cloning amplification system of immunocytes in vitro, and improve the antiviral immune system severely damaged before by transfusing the clone cells modified by specific HIV antigen.

 So HIV infected patients could discontinue the traditional anti-viral drug, but not develop opportunistic infections,which could obviously increase the life qualities of these patients.

 Reconstitution of HIV-specific Immunity Against HIV@highlight

Research Goal: To reconstitute the anti-HIV specific immunity system of the AIDS patients, so the viruses could not massively replicate when HAART was discontinued, then make HIV functional cure possible.
