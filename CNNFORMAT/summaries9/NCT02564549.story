(secondQuint)MRI-Based Active Surveillance to Avoid the Risks of Serial Biopsies in Men With Low-Risk Prostate Ca.

 This is an unblinded, randomized trial of TRUS biopsy-based active surveillance versus mpMRI-based active surveillance.

 Patients on the TRUS biopsy-based arm will undergo annual systematic biopsies without any MRI staging or guidance.

 Patients on the mpMRI- based arm will undergo annual mpMRI surveillance imaging, with image-guided targeted biopsies only as indicated by radiographic findings.
