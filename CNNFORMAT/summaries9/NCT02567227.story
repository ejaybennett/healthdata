(thirdQuint)Cognitive Remediation to Improve Mobility in Sedentary Seniors.

 Emerging evidence indicates that Executive Functions play an important role in maintaining locomotion in aging and preventing mobility disabilities.

 However, use of cognitive training programs to improve executive functions as a strategy to increase mobility has not been explored.

 Exciting results from the preliminary study support the efficacy and feasibility of the cognitive remediation approach to improve locomotion in older adults.

 The premise of this clinical trial is that disability among seniors is a potentially preventable chronic condition rather than an irreversible consequence of aging and disease.

 The investigators proposed novel approach to locomotion has the potential to shift treatment paradigms in the field of disability by introducing cognitive approaches to mobility that can be applied to prevention and rehabilitation in diverse settings.

 Through this 'proof of concept' secondary prevention trial the investigators will fill an important gap in knowledge for practicing evidence-based medicine and developing effective interventions for a major health outcome affecting a substantial proportion of the U.

 Cognitive Remediation to Improve Mobility in Sedentary Seniors@highlight

The investigators propose to conduct a single-blind randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a computerized cognitive remediation intervention program on improving locomotion in sedentary seniors, a group at an especially high risk for disability.

 The hypothesis is that executive functions will respond to the cognitive remediation program and in turn enhance locomotion.
