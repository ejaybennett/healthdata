(fifthQuint)Active Induction of Labor in Pregnancies Complicated With Oligohydramnios at Term.

 The study was designed as a prospective study.

 The rates of cesarean section and maternal/fetal outcomes had been compared between pregnancies complicated with isolated oligohydramnios at term and postdate pregnancies.

 All patients with isolated oligohydramnios were term (37-40 weeks' gestation according to accurate last menstrual period and first trimester sonographic examination).

 Oligohydramnios was defined as an amniotic fluid index < 5 cm.

 The control group consisted of prolonged pregnancies in the absence of spontaneous labor and oligohydramnios.

 Prolonged pregnancy is diagnosed if 41 gestational weeks are completed according to accurate date of last menstrual period and first trimester ultrasound.

 All patients who accepted to join the study gave informed consent.

 All patients had a complete physical and obstetrical examination.

 Vital signs were recorded at regular intervals.

 The primary outcome measure was defined as cesarean section rates in pregnancies complicated with isolated oligohydramnios managed by induction of labor.
