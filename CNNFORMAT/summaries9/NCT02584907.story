(fifthQuint)Fat Based Enteral Nutrition for Blood Glucose Control in ICU.

 In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 88 eligible hospitalized ICU patients with EN will be included.

 Written consent form will be completed.

 Physical examination will be done by specialist and nutritional care process will be offered by an RD.

 Demographic, laboratory and nutritional data will be extracted and entered in prepared form.

 Venous blood samples will be taken and laboratory values will be measured and recorded at specified times.

 Patients will be divided into two groups.

 The control group with the standard EN (Protein; 20% carbohydrate; 50% and fat; 30% from total calories) and intervention group with high fat EN (Protein; 20% carbohydrate; 35% and fat; 45% from total calories).

 50% of the total fat will be provided by olive oil.

 Any feeding rout such as naso - gastric , Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG ) or Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) with Intermittent feeding protocol will be accepted feeding method .
