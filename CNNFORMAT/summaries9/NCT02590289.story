 This is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-way crossover, 4-sequence study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and food effect of BBI-5000 capsules in healthy adult subjects.

 Participating subjects will receive a single oral dose of BBI-5000 followed by a washout period of 7-14 days between doses.

 The treatment period will be followed by 5-10 day follow-up period.
