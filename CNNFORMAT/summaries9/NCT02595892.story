(fifthQuint)Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Alone or With M6620 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Assess and compare progression free survival (PFS) between gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride)/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 Determine and compare overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 II.

 Determine and compare the safety profile of gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone regimens.

 III.

 Assess and compare PFS at 6 months between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 IV.

 Determine and compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 V.

 Determine and compare the duration of response (DOR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 VI.

 Determine and compare cancer antigen (CA)125 reduction by >= 50% between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 VII.

 Determine and compare overall survival (OS) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

 VIII.

 Determine the ORR for subjects in the gemcitabine alone arm who cross over to the gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) arm.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm II.

 ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I and ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9.

 Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

 Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Alone or With M6620 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 (M6620) and gemcitabine hydrochloride work compared to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent).

 ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth, and may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work better.

 Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a drug used in chemotherapy that works to stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking cells from growing and repairing themselves, causing them to die.

 It is not yet known whether adding ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
