(thirdQuint)Metrological Characteristics of the Inertial Unit "FOX HiKoB" in Comparison With the Reference System for the Adaptive Trigger System "Functional Electrical Stimulation" of Foot Elevators in Hemiplegic Post-stroke Patients.

 The secondary objectives of this study are: 1.

 / - to assess the metrological characteristics of the data from inertial sensors (FOX (C) HiKoB) for the reconstruction of the movement in comparison with reference systems (GaitRite or Zebris systems, VICON) in terms of: A.

 Ability to determine the walking speed, stride length, the acceleration of plantar flexion at the beginning of the weight-bearing phase B.

 Ability to objectify performance reduction during a 6 minute test.

 C.

 Ability to identify different types of movement: simple walking, turn, obstacle clearance, staircase.

 2.

 / - to analyze the EMG signal upon voluntary dorsiflexion of the foot of the paretic side from a sitting position before and after a fatigue test (objective D).

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the metrological characteristics of the data processing algorithms from inertial sensors (FOX (C) HiKoB) for the reconstruction of movement relative to the reference system (VICON) for measurement of dorsiflexion at the beginning of a step and in the middle of the oscillating phase.
