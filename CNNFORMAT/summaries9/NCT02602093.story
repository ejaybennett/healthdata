(fifthQuint)Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy vs.

 Open Microdiscectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation (PTED-study).

 Rationale: Lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LSRS) is caused by a herniated lumbar nucleus pulposus (HNP) and the estimated annual incidence in The Netherlands ranges between 60,000 to 75,000 people.

 Open microdiscectomy is the standard surgical technique.

 In recent years, several surgical techniques have been developed including, percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED).

 While PTED is gaining popularity in The Netherlands, evidence of its effects is lacking, leading to a heated debate.

 The current position of Zorginstituut Nederland (ZiN) is that there is insufficient evidence to support its use; therefore, PTED is not financially covered.

 The consequence is, patients are forced to pay the costs of treatment themselves.

 This study is expected to provide the necessary data to answer the question regarding effects and costs of PTED vs.

 open microdiscectomy, and help resolve the current debate.

 Objective: To determine the effects and costs of PTED vs.

 open microdiscectomy.

 Study design: Pragmatic, multi-center non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) with subsequent observational study once sufficient subjects have been recruited for the RCT.

 Study population: In total, 682 subjects are to be included.

 The inclusion criteria are as follows: subjects 18-70 years of age with > 10 weeks of radiating pain with- or without motor or sensory loss in the leg, or with > 6 weeks of excessive radiating pain and no tendency for any clinical improvement and strong patient preference for surgery.

 There must also be an indication for an operation and a MRI demonstrating lumbar disc herniation with nerve compression with or without concomitant spinal or lateral recess stenosis or sequestration.

 Participants must also have sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language.

 Main study parameters/endpoints: There is one primary outcome: self-report leg pain (0- 10 numeric rating scale (NRS)); secondary outcomes include among others functional status (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)) and are to be measured the day following treatment and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9,12 and 24 months.

 The data will be analyzed longitudinally, meaning there is no primary endpoint.
