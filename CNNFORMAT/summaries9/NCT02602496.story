(thirdQuint)Promoting Gastrointestinal Health and Reducing Subclinical Inflammation in Obese Individuals.

 Literature data suggests that fruits and vegetables and whole grains containing dietary fiber and other nutrients are important for maintaining beneficial microbes in the gut.

 The presence of beneficial microbes in the gut may mediate the subclinical inflammation experienced in metabolic disease.

 In this project, overweight or obese participants with low intakes of fruits and vegetables or whole grains will increase their intake of these foods to recommended levels.

 Changes in markers of inflammation and gut microbiota composition will be determined to assess and compare the potential impact of these foods on metabolic disease.

This study evaluates the impact of increased intake of fruits and vegetables and whole grains on markers of inflammation and gut microbial composition.

 The treatment groups are 3 servings of whole grain per day; 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day; a combined 3 servings of whole grain per day and 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day; and a control (3 servings of refined grains per day provided).
