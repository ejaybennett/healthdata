(fifthQuint)Exercise Rehabilitation in Veterans With PAD.

 Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its associated declines in physical function impair quality of life (QOL) in nearly 20% of older Veterans and result in substantial VA health care costs.

 Revascularization addresses the anatomical pathology, but does not restore mobility function and QOL.

 Optimal therapy may require post-revascularization rehabilitation to address lingering defects in skeletal muscle that limit function; however, the current standard of care after revascularization does not include rehabilitation.

 Exercise training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may enhance function by increasing muscle perfusion.

 Together, these two therapies may work in a complementary manner to improve outcomes in older Veterans with PAD after revascularization.

 The investigators will enroll Veterans (50-80 years of age) with PAD who are planned for percutaneous revascularization.

 Participants will complete research testing consisting of: a) Assessment of mobility function and QOL; b) Treadmill tests to assess ambulatory capacity, and calf muscle perfusion; and c) A gastrocnemius needle biopsy to measure capillary density and angiogenic growth factor expression.

 Participants will undergo baseline testing prior to revascularization and will repeat research testing 2-3 weeks after revascularization to determine the effect of only revascularization on functional outcomes.

 After post-revascularization testing, 52 patients will be randomized to one of four groups (Exercise-only, NMES-only, Exercise+NMES, or Standard Care; n=13/group).

 After completion of the 3-month intervention, participants will repeat all tests to determine the effects of the interventions compared to standard care.

 Exercise Rehabilitation in Veterans With PAD@highlight

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results in blockages of arteries (blood vessels) and decreased blood flow to the legs.

 This may cause difficulty or pain with walking or other activities that use leg muscles.

 Exercise may help improve blood flow in the legs and improve the ability to walk.

 This research project will be conducted patients with PAD that require revascularization.

 The goal is to examine the effects of 3 months of exercise rehabilitation and neuromuscular stimulation on leg blood flow, physical function, quality of life and general health.
