(secondQuint)High Dose Vitamin D3 in Crohn's Disease.

 In patients with Crohn's disease in remission, the investigators hypothesized higher doses of vitamin D would more effectively improve 25-hydroxy(OH)-vitamin D levels and would be tolerated well without side effects of hypercalcemia.

 The investigators also wanted to explore whether higher doses could reduce the clinical relapse rate of patients with Crohn's disease in remission, and if higher doses of vitamin D3 could improve depression and anxiety symptoms.

 In order to determine if there is benefit from high-dose vitamin D3, the investigators designed a pilot randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing doses of oral vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily to 1000 IU daily.
