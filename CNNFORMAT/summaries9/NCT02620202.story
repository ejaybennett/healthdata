(fifthQuint)Aiming Towards Evidence Based Interpretation of Cardiac Biomarkers in Patients Presenting With Chest Pain.

 The WESTCOR-study will include patients presenting to the Emergency Department of Haukeland University Hospital and Stavanger University Hospital with symptoms indicative of acute coronary syndrome.

 1500 patients will be included at Haukeland University Hospital and 1500 at Stavanger University Hospital.

 The two locations use different high sensitive troponin assays (i.

e.

 hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI (Abbott Diagnostics) for routine diagnostic of coronary syndrome.

 3000 patients will be sampled and hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI will be measured at admission, after three hours and after 8-12 hours.

 Clinicians will be blinded to the results of the hs-cTn assay that is not used as routine assay locally.

 Final diagnosis will be made by two independent cardiologists based on all available clinical information and results of the routine tests.

 The ability to diagnose or exclude MI at different sampling points in different patient populations will be compared for the two hs troponin assays.

 Differences in the clinical follow-up of will be compared for the two locations and related to eventual differences i hs-cTn results.

 Analytical interferences will be measured for the different assays.

 1500 patients will have an additional sample 1 hour after admission.

 The clinicians will be blinded to the results of this sample (both hs-cTn assays).

 The ability of the one-hour sample to diagnose or exclude myocardial infraction (MI) will be compared between the two assays.

 All patients will have a follow-up sample 3 months after discharge.

 The patients will further be followed for 20 years through national registers and the prognostic value of hs-cTn concentrations and dynamics as well as other biomarkers, will be measured.

 Aiming Towards Evidence Based Interpretation of Cardiac Biomarkers in Patients Presenting With Chest Pain@highlight

The main aim of the WESTCOR study is to - investigate the ability of two high sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays to diagnose acute coronary syndrome and predict prognosis in different patient populations (e.

g.

 gender, age and co-morbidity) - to validate the suggested 1 hour protocol for rule in and rule out of acute coronary syndrome for two hs-cTn assays in an unselected chest pain population - to investigate different biomarkers ability to predict long term prognosis after hospitalization for chest pain
