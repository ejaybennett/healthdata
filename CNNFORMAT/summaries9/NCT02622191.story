(thirdQuint)Analysis of the Eye in Patients With Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and a Visual Field Defect in One Eye.

 There are two important areas of the eye that investigators need to better look at in order to further understanding of glaucoma.

 The first area is the retina (part of the eye that converts images from the eye's optical system into electrical impulses that are sent along the optic nerve to the brain).

 Newer technology (Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography) now allows us to look at the different layers of the retina and measure the thickness of each layer carefully.

 The second area is the lamina cribrosa (a portion of the white part of the eye which has the nerve fibers passing through it that connect the eye to the brain).

 If the lamina cribrosa is thin, it is possible that it may bend more easily and disrupt these nerve fibers.

 New technology (Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography) now allows us to measure the thickness of the lamina cribrosa.

 In this study, the investigators will look at and measure the thickness of the different retinal layers as well as the lamina cribrosa.

 These findings will help monitor and understand better the changes that occur in the eye as a result of glaucoma.

 The investigators have chosen individuals with primary open-angle glaucoma and unilateral visual field defects as the main patient population (in addition to normal controls).

 By approximating each participants baseline anatomy using the fellow, "internal control" eye, the investigators will be able to better determine if any changes occur in the macula or the lamina cribrosa as a result of glaucoma.

The investigators aims to further the understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and progression by utilizing both enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography to visualize and measure the lamina cribrosa in vivo and segmentation technology to accurately delineate and measure the boundaries of the retinal layers.

 The investigators will elaborate further on the key concepts of lamina cribrosa thickness and transynaptic degeneration.
