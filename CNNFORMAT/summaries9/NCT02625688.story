(fifthQuint)The Risk of Hyperbilirubinemia in Term Newborns After Placental Transfusion.

 The investigators feel that published results regarding 'jaundice" and "jaundice needing phototherapy' (associated with DCC) may be misleading.

 First, no information is offered about how "clinical jaundice "was assessed on examination.

 The absence of jaundice is not an indication of the absence of hyperbilirubinemia.

 Estimation of the degree of hyperbilirubinemia based solely on clinical examination can lead to errors.

 The absence or the severity of jaundice is not predictive of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia.

 A recent study revealed that the nurses' predischarge assessment of jaundice extent was only moderately correlated with bilirubin concentration and was similar in black and nonblack infants.

 A review published nearly 10 years ago regarding late umbilical cord clamping revealed only 4 studies which as a secondary objective which assessed whether the time of cord clamping was associated with an increased risk of polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia during the first week of life.

 Two studies reported that neonates with DCC had bilirubin levels >15 mg/dl.

 No information is provided on what hour of life the bilirubin levels were measured exactly.

 Secondly, guidelines to treat jaundice have changed over time and none of the studies mention what threshold was used for administering phototherapy.

 No information is given if, staff responsible for phototherapy administration was blinded to the type of cord clamping intervention.

 Potential confounders such as isoimmune hemolytic disease, symptoms of sepsis (significant lethargy, temperature instability), asphyxia, G6PD, acidosis, albumin 60 seconds after delivery; and controlled traction of the umbilical cord.

 These interventions are aimed at reduction in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage.

 However, ECC eliminates the possibility of additional blood flowing from the placenta to the newborn, and deprives the baby from numerous profits such as receiving extra amounts of iron.

 This potential additional amount of iron prevents iron deficiency during the first year of life in infants born with delayed cord clamping.

 Research Hypothesis Neither delayed cord clamping nor cord milking during labor does not increase significantly the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia in comparison to early cord clamping.

 Description of trial design The trail is designed as a randomized controlled, observer blinded trial with 3 parallel groups and a primary endpoint of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy.

 Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1:1 allocation.

 The experiment is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of delayed cord clamping and cord milking group in comparison to early cord clamping group regarding the incidence of bilirubinemia treated with phototherapy in neonates.

 Description of study settings The study will be carried out in the Princess Anne's Hospital in Warsaw, Poland.

 This is a level III teaching hospital with approximately 3500 (1000 < 37 weeks of gestation) deliveries per year and 63 neonatal beds.

 It is also a referral center for gestational and pre-gestational diabetes as well as pregnancy induced hypertension.

 Having access to high risk mothers will augment the population of small for gestation infants (SGA), and infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) in the study.

 SGA and IDM have an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia, thus the presence of the above patients will improve the generalizability of the study population.

 The local protocol on cord clamping has not yet been adjusted to the new ILCOR guidelines, but labour ward staff are willing to implement new procedures.

 This should improve trail recruitment and adherence.

 The Risk of Hyperbilirubinemia in Term Newborns After Placental Transfusion@highlight

Delayed cord clamping (DCC) has been a subject of extensive research for the last couple of years.

 Based on published data, numerous neonatal benefits have been suggested such as increased hemoglobin and ferritin levels both at birth and longer term.

 Available systematic reviews of DCC versus early cord clamping (ECC) reveal that it may also contribute to other neonatal outcomes including polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

 A review published nearly 10 years ago regarding late umbilical cord clamping revealed only 4 studies which as a second objective assessed whether the time of cord clamping was associated with an increased risk of polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia during the first week of life.

 Two studies reported that neonates with DCC had bilirubin levels >15 mg/dl.

 No information is provided on what hour of life the bilirubin levels were measured exactly.

 In this randomized control study the investigators would like to determine if delayed cord clamping or cord milking during labor increases the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia (requiring phototherapy) in term infants.
