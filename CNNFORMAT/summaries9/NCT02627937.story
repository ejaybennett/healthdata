(secondQuint)Clinical Predictors of Pediatric OSAHS.

 The prevalence of OSAHS is estimated to be about 1% to 4% in children, however, it is frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.

Current diagnostic approaches are based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and physical examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography (PSG).

 Previous studies have reported the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for predicting pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results.

 Despite the potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used in clinical practice.

 Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed diagnostic or screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for the cost-effective care of these patients.

The purpose of this study is to develop adequate and satisfactory tools using reliable clinical and physical factors in predicting pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and allow greater access to appropriate therapy in children.
