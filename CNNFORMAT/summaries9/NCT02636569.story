(fifthQuint)Topical Chemoprevention of Skin Cancer Biomarkers.

 Men and women ( 18 yo)who have been seen as patients in the Dermatology Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and at least 8 actinic keratoses on the upper extremities are potentially eligible for study participation.

 We propose to examine two topical medications, both of which are already FDA approved, used alone or in combination with a placebo comparator.

 The purpose of the study is to see if diclofenac and -difluoromethylornithine (DMFO) can be applied daily or if they need to be applied twice per day each in order to achieve the desired results.

 We will be examining levels of specific biomarkers in the skin that are associated with risk of developing skin cancer.

 We hope to see these levels decrease with once daily or twice daily use of these medications when both diclofenac and DMFO are used.

 Results from this study will help guide us in a second study where we will look at longer term use of these medications and how they are associated with changes in skin biomarkers that are related to skin cancer.

 The second longer study will use the dose (once or twice daily topical application of diclofenac and DMFO) that resulted in a decrease in biomarkers, as discovered in this currently proposed study.

 Topical Chemoprevention of Skin Cancer Biomarkers@highlight

This research study will test how well two topical medications work to prevent the development of non-melanoma skin cancers by reversing certain biomarkers in the skin.

 This study is also looking at the optimal dose of a medication in a small number of people.

 Biomarkers are molecules that are found in the body and inside of cells.

 Some biomarkers are associated with specific diseases such as skin cancer.

 In this study, two topical medications will be evaluated; diclofenac and alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO).

 Diclofenac and DFMO are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other uses.

 24 patients will be enrolled in this study by University of Alabama at Birmingham.
