(thirdQuint)Combining Lovastatin and a Parent-Implemented Language Intervention for Fragile X Syndrome.

 This is the first multi-modal treatment to combine a targeted treatment for FXS, lovastatin, with an innovative parent-implemented intervention (PILI) targeting language and challenging behavior delivered through telehealth technology.

The hypothesis is that targeted treatments will be more effective when applied in combination with PILI.

 Examination of whether changes in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by FMRP (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness.

 Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response.

 It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment.

 Once modeled in FXS, results from these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including Rasopathies.

 The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for 10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within picture-book based story-telling episodes.

 Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted strategies in other everyday interactions with their child.

 The intervention will be delivered to parents in their homes by way of video teleconferencing (VTC).

 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention alone or in combination with Lovastatin.

 Combining Lovastatin and a Parent-Implemented Language Intervention for Fragile X Syndrome@highlight

The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of a 20 week multi-modal treatment comprised of lovastatin or placebo, and the Parent-implemented Language Intervention (PILI) in children with FXS.

 Children will be randomized to drug or placebo in a double-blind design with all participating in the PILI.

 The primary endpoint will be to measure improvements in spoken language and behavior among lovastatin-treated than placebo treated participants.
