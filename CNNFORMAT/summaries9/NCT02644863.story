(firstQuint)Autologous Tumor Tissue Antigen-sensitized DC-CIK Cells Combined With Chemotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.

 60 patients of esophageal cancer with TNM stage of tumor stage II-III,who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive cancer tissue antigen sensitized D-CIK immune cells in combination with chemotherapy treatment) or group B (just receive chemotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.

 Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of autologous antigen-sensitized DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks) and chemotherapy.

 Patients in group B will receive only 3 cycles chemotherapy.
