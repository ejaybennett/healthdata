.

 OBJECTIVES Evaluate the effectiveness of Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy (TBCT) compared to Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) in the treatment of OCD patients, by neuroimaging tests such as MRI.

 1.

 Describe the neuroanatomical profile of the sample participants before and after the psychotherapeutic intervention by MRI; 2.

 Compare the profile neuroanatomical between the experimental group and the control group by MRI; 3.

 Identify possible neuroanatomical differences in the participating sample of pre and post-treatment, both among individuals and among psychotherapeutic intervention groups; 4.

 To investigate associations between the results of MRI scans and indexes the scales currently used to assess severity of OCD.
