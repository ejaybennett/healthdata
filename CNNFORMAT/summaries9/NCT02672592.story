(fifthQuint)Effects of Interleukin-1 Beta on Low Testosterone Levels in Men With Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.

 Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are considered as chronic low-grade inflammatory states.

 Elevated pro-inflammatory mediators in obesity and metabolic syndrome have an inhibitory effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) leading to hypogonadism.

 Decreased testosterone production in obese men in turn promotes additional fat deposition, contributing to a vicious cycle of fat accumulation.

 This complex pathophysiological interplay is termed hypogonadal-obesity-adipocytokine hypothesis, describing a bidirectional relationship between low levels of testosterone and the metabolic syndrome.

 TestIL is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that inhibition of IL-1-activity diminishes the inhibitory effects on HPG axis and increases testosterone levels in men with metabolic syndrome.

 Effects of Interleukin-1 Beta on Low Testosterone Levels in Men With Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome@highlight

Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in men are associated with a high prevalence of hypogonadism of up to 50%.

 Increased fat mass leads to augmented release of adipocytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1-beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha which in turn suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to hypogonadism.

 This pathophysiological interplay is termed hypogonadal-obesity-adipocytokine hypothesis.
