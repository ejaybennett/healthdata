(secondQuint)Metformin for the Minimization of Geographic Atrophy Progression in Patients With AMD.

 This is a phase II, single-blind, randomized, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of metformin use to decrease geographic atrophy (GA) progression in non-diabetic patients with dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

 Approximately 100 study subjects throughout four separate study sites will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment group and the observation group.

 The treatment group will be assigned to the study intervention (oral Metformin) for 18 months while the observation group will receive no intervention for 18 months, instead continuing with standard of care ophthalmic exams and close monitoring of their disease.

 Throughout the 18 month study period, the progression of subjects' GA or drusen growth will be measured via ocular imaging taken at standard of care follow-up examinations, including fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus photography.
