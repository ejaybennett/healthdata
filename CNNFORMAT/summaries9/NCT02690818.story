(firstQuint)Promoting Adherence to Treatment for Latent TB Infection Through Text Messaging.

 We aim to determine the feasibility and acceptability of text reminders for improving adherence in latent TB patients.

 Specific objectives of the current study are to: 1) Assess the feasibility of the intervention as indicated by participant recruitment and retention and; 2) Evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, as indicated by intervention adherence, outcome measurement rates, and feedback from participants.

 Data will be used to design a definitive trial which will test the hypothesis that the intervention will improve medication adherence, as measured through an increase in treatment completion rates, and result in higher self-reported medication adherence, fewer missed appointments and doses, and a shorter course of treatment.
