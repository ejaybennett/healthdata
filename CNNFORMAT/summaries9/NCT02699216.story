(thirdQuint)BioCurrent Electrical Stimulation for the Treatment of Dry ARMD.

 The study will assess the effectiveness of transpalpebral micro-current electrical stimulation on improving the visual acuity in subjects with vision loss from Dry Macular Degeneration.

 The BioCurrent electrical stimulation will be applied by a device with the intended use of treating Dry Macular Degeneration.

 The device delivers a micro-current, an electrical current in the one millionth of an ampere range, to the retina in frequencies changing in a pre-defined pattern from 5Hz to 80Hz during each spot (40 sec).

 The device also incorporates a voltage limiter (a maximum of 245 micro A is possible) and a current level indicator.

 200 micro A will be used.

 Very low electrical micro-current is delivered to the subject through the goggle probe.

 BioCurrent Electrical Stimulation for the Treatment of Dry ARMD@highlight

This study evaluates the treatment of Dry Macular Degeneration and the resulting change in vision with a very, very low current that is similar to what occurs in the body naturally.

 In Phase 1, 16 participants will be treated, with half receiving treatment and half a sham (no treatment).

 After the treatment period of one week, those not treated will be treated.

 In Phase 2, all participants will be treated.
