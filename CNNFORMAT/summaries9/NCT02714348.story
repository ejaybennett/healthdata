(thirdQuint)Impact of Helminth Infections During Pregnancy on Humoral Vaccine Immunogenicity in Infants.

 There is evidence that helminth infections during pregnancy affect the immune system of the mother and the unborn child.

 As a consequence, the antimicrobial- immune and vaccine- response of the infant may be deficient.

 The aim of the present study is to measure the influence of maternal helminth infection (schistosomal, filarial and intestinal helminth infection) on vaccine immunogenicity of their infants.

 The main focus is on immune responses of infants to vaccine antigens given as part of the expanded program on immunization (EPI) in Gabon at an age when infants are unlikely to be infected with helminths and are immunologically primed by their intrauterine life.

 The objective is to investigate if and which species of helminths during pregnancy have an effect on any of the EPI vaccine-induced immune responses.

 Impact of Helminth Infections During Pregnancy on Humoral Vaccine Immunogenicity in Infants@highlight

Helminth infection is associated with low vaccine immunogenicity.

 Pregnant women are particularly sensitive to helminth infection.

 Since most vaccines are given shortly after birth, an effect of parasites on infant immunogenicity is of particular concern.

 Therefore, within this study the investigators aim to investigate if maternal infection influences vaccine immunogenicity in the newborn.
