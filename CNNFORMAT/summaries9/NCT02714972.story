(fifthQuint)Reduction of Nocturnal Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia in the Home Using Predictive Algorithms, Pump Suspension, and Insulin Dosing in Children and Young Adolescents.

 Subjects who are eligible for the clinical trial initially will use a Veo insulin pump and Enlite CGM sensor at home for a minimum of 6 days/week over a 2-week period to verify that the subject is able to use the CGM and insert sensors.

 The first 10 subjects enrolled will be 11 to 300 mg/dl (16.

7 mmol/L).

 Monitoring processes will ensure that the subject can be contacted if these values are not reported as required or are out of range.

 - Subjects will be asked to record all overnight carbohydrate intake using the controller software interface.

 - Subjects will be asked to perform periodic CGM data uploads using the controller software interface.

 Monitoring processes will ensure that the subject can be contacted if these uploads do not occur as required, or if review of an upload reveals any extreme, prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or elevated morning blood glucose values.

 Once approximately 200 nights of randomized clinical trial phase data are available, the study DSMB will perform another data review to determine whether it is safe to continue the study.

 Subjects already using the study system at home will continue to use it during the DSMB review process, but no additional subjects will begin home use of the system until the DSMB review is complete.

 Upon completion of the study, subjects as well as study clinicians will be asked to complete a human factors usability questionnaire regarding use of the study system.

 There will be a follow-up (optional) extension phase for subjects who exhibit safe and competent use of the system at home.

 They may be given the option to continue home use of the system for up to 56 days to assess whether data-driven, subject-level customization of algorithm parameters improves glycemic outcomes compared with generic algorithm parameters that are identical for each subject.

Objective: to gain experience in children and younger adolescents with in-home use of an algorithm that will dose insulin to minimize projected hyperglycemia overnight in addition to suspending the pump if hypoglycemia is projected overnight and to obtain feasibility, safety, and initial efficacy data Study Design: randomized controlled trial, with randomization on a night level within subject Patient Population: Youth 6.

 Major Safety Outcomes: CGM measures of hypo- and hyperglycemia, including morning blood glucose and mean overnight sensor glucose; adverse events including severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis
