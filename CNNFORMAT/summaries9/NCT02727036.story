 A beneficial effect of pumpkin seed oil on blood pressure has been observed in postmenopausal women.

 More than 1 in 3 female adults have some form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is affected by blood pressure.

 Phytoestrogens are compounds found in plants and are comparable to human estrogen, capable of producing estrogenic effects.

 Studies in post menopausal women have demonstrated that pumpkin seed oil, at a dose of 2g per day for 12 weeks can decrease blood pressure and reduce menopausal symptoms.
