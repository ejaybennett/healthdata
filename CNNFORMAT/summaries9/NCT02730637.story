(thirdQuint)Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury Through Biomarker-guided Nephrological Intervention.

 This study examines the impact of an early biomarker-guided intervention on the development of acute kidney injury (AKI).

 New biomarkers indicate kidney damage in an early stage before developing acute kidney injury according to AKI Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Definition is detectable.

 The investigators want to test if it's possible to prevent AKI based on elevated urinary biomarkers.

 Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to two groups, a control and an intervention Group by an early nephrologic consultation.

 The interventional group will receive an early preventive nephrologist consultation additionally to standard care.

This study examines the clinical relevance of early biomarkers to detect and prevent acute kidney injury.

 High-risk patients for developing acute kidney injury will be screened at initial presentation (emergency department and intensive care unit) for TIMP2xIGFBP7.

 In case of elevated readings patients will be randomized in two arms: The control group will be treated with standard care, the intervention group will receive an early nephrologic consultation.
