(fifthQuint)Trial of Liver Resection Versus No Surgery in Patients With Liver and Unresectable Pulmonary Metastases From Colorectal Cancer (Liver Resection With Unresectable Lung Nodules From Colorectal Adenocarcinoma - LUNA).

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 You will have an equal chance to be assigned to either group.

 - If you are assigned to Group 1, you will have liver resection surgery, followed by standard of care chemotherapy.

 The chemotherapy you receive will depend on what the doctor thinks is in your best interest.

 - If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive standard of care chemotherapy that your doctor thinks is in your best interest.

 You will sign a separate consent form explaining how the standard of care chemotherapy works, the chemotherapy schedule, and its risks.

 Group 1: If you are in Group 1, you will have standard of care liver resection surgery.

 A portion of the liver that is affected by the tumor will be removed either with many small incisions or one large incision.

 An ultrasound device will be used to help the doctor see the affected area.

 The study doctor will explain this procedure in more detail and you will sign a separate consent form explaining the standard of care surgery and its risks.

 Study Visits: Both groups will have study visits every 3-6 months while on study.

 The following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam.

 - You will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check status of disease.

 - You will have an abdominal and pelvic CT scan, PET/CT scan, or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

 - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

 - You will complete the quality of life survey you completed during screening.

 If you are unable to return to MD Anderson every 3-6 months, you or your regular care doctor will be contacted for follow-up information, and the tests listed above can be performed outside of MD Anderson.

 The study doctor will discuss this with you.

 Length of Study: You will be on study for up to 3 years.

 You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

 Trial of Liver Resection Versus No Surgery in Patients With Liver and Unresectable Pulmonary Metastases From Colorectal Cancer (Liver Resection With Unresectable Lung Nodules From Colorectal Adenocarcinoma - LUNA)@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effect of having liver resection with standard of care chemotherapy to having standard of care chemotherapy alone in patients whose colorectal cancer has spread to their liver and lungs.

 This is an investigational study.

 Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer that is able to be resected can be done with standard techniques using FDA-approved devices.

 Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer that can only be partially resected is considered investigational.

 Up to 80 participants will take part in this study.

 All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
