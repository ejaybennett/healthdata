(secondQuint)Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) in Healthy Children.

 The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV).

 TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever and to look at long-term safety results.

 This study will look at the success rate of TDV in preventing dengue fever (vaccine efficacy) and long-term side effects of the vaccine.

 The study will be conducted in 3 parts.

 Part 1 will evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE) and will last a minimum of 15 months.

 Part 2 will be for an additional 6 months to evaluate VE.

 Part 3 will evaluate long-term safety by following participants for side effects and will last an additional 3 years.

 Participants may be enrolled into a dry-run to commence and test febrile surveillance methodology; this dry-run part may be upto 10 months prior to receiving study injection, however, will not be applicable to all trials sites or participants.

 Approximately 20,100 participants will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned (by chance) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctors during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - TDV 0.

5 mL subcutaneous injection - Placebo (dummy inactive subcutaneous injection) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will receive a single injection on Day 1 and Day 90.

 A subset of participants will be asked to record any local symptoms at the injection site (Pain, Erythema and Swelling) in a diary card for 7 days after each injection.

 The same subset of participants will also be asked to record any systemic symptoms (child 6 years: fever, headache, asthenia, malaise and myalgia) in a diary card for 14 days after each injection.

 This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide.

 The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 4.

75 years excluding the dry-run.

 Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be contacted at least every week for the entire study duration.
