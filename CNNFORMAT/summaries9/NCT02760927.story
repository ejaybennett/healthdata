(firstQuint)Assessment of a Oral Endotracheal Tube Fastener on Patients Intubated With Oral Endotracheal Tubes.

 Endotracheal intubation is the trans laryngeal placement of a tube into the trachea via the nose or mouth.

 Subglottic suctioning, during endotracheal tube securement, is important for mechanically-ventilated patients to allow for the clearance of secretions that may accumulate during intubation.

 This protocol examines an enhancement to the current AnchorFast Guard device in order for the device to hold a subglottic suctioning lumen in addition to the intubation tube.
