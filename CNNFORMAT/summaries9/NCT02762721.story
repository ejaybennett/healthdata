(firstQuint)Analysis of Oncogenes in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma or Mixed Hepatocellular-Cholangiocarcinoma in Tumor Tissue Samples.

 This is a non-interventional, observational study of archived human tissue samples; no surgical procedures will be required and no treatment will be provided as part of this study.

 Approximately 150 archived tissue samples obtained from patients with iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA will be analyzed for somatic alteration status and will include cholangiocarcinoma-specific FGFR2 fusion isoforms.
