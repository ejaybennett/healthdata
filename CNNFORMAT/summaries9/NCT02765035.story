(thirdQuint)C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4 Study in Transfemoral Amputees.

 During the last two decades many microprocessor controlled knee joints (MPK) appeared on the market.

The newly developed C-Leg 4 aims to provide improved standing function while in the same time offering technology of knees previous version (C-Leg 3).

 Since added functional benefit of a knee joint cannot be anticipated just due to the fact that the knee is controlled by the microprocessor, the aim of this post-market study is to evaluate the safety, functional mobility and satisfaction of the microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee components C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4 in comparison to mechanical knee joints.

 Additional goal is to improve the methodological quality of research conducted in the field.

The aim of this post-market study is to confirm that the microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee components (C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4) in comparison to mechanical knee joints can bring additional benefit to the users primarily on level walking and secondarily in safety, stair and hill mobility, activities of daily living, satisfaction and preference.
