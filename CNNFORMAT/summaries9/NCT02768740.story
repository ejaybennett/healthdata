 The placebo was saline serum supplied as 10 ml ampoules.

 The study drugs were administered according to two protocols.

 In the 200-mg group, patients received an intravenous bolus of 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours for seven days associated with a continuous infusion of placebo for five days.

 In the 300-mg group, patients received an initial bolus of 100 mg of hydrocortisone followed by a continuous infusion of 300 mg per day for five days associated with a bolus of placebo every six hours for seven days.

@highlight

We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, pilot study in four adult medical intensive care units.

 Patients presenting septic shock were rapidly administered one of two regimens of hydrocortisone, either a 50-mg intravenous bolus every six hours during seven days (200-mg group) or a 100-mg initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 300 mg daily for five days (300-mg group).

 Hydrocortisone was stopped abruptly at the end of treatment.
