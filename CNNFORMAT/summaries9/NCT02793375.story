(fifthQuint)Does Montelukast Decrease Post Adenotonsillectomy Pain in Children.

 Adenotonsillectomy (T&A) is the one of the most common pediatric procedures performed in the United States, with over 530,000 procedures performed annually1.

 Pain control after T&A is essential for improving recovery and enhancing quality of life.

 At CCHMC, our current protocol in patients over the age of three is to treat pain with scheduled Tylenol, ibuprofen and steroids, as well as opioids (oxycodone) as a "rescue" medication for uncontrolled pain.

 Despite this regimented approach, pain control is often suboptimal, and numerous doses of opioids are often required.

 Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist that may have a role in decreasing post T&A pain2.

 The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of montelukast on post-T&A pain by measuring the amount of opioid pain medication required postoperatively in patients receiving montelukast preoperatively compared to those receiving placebo.

 The secondary objective will evaluate post-surgical outcomes and include group comparisons of post T&A pain scores and number of Emergency department visits and/or phone calls for perioperative pain related complaints.

 Hypothesis #1 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the amount of opioid pain mediation required in the first 24 hours postoperatively compared to those in the control group.

 Hypothesis #2 Preoperative montelukast will decrease pain scores in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients undergoing T&A compared to those in the control group.

 Hypothesis#3 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the number of postoperative contacts (Emergency department visits and phone calls) by parents for pain related concerns in the first 3-4 weeks after surgery.

 Does Montelukast Decrease Post Adenotonsillectomy Pain in Children@highlight

Objective: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative Montelukast as an analgesic for adenotonsillectomy Study Design: Randomized controlled double blinded clinical trial.

 Setting: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Methods: Children between the age of 3-8 undergoing adenotonsillectomy with planned 23 hour observation for adenotonsillar hypertrophy and sleep disordered breathing will be randomized to receive either montelukast or placebo in Same Day surgery.

 Analysis: Differences in demographics (age, gender, race, weight) between the intervention and control groups will be assessed using chi-square (for categorical measures) and t tests (for continuous measures).

 Differences in postoperative opioid usage, postoperative pain scores using the FLACC scale, and the number of postoperative contacts (Emergency department visits or phone calls) with patients or their family regarding pain or tonsillar hemorrhage will be evaluated using chi-square (categorical measures) and t tests (continuous measures).
