(secondQuint)A Clinical Trial of Topical Photodynamic Therapy With 5-aminolevulinic Acid for the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis.

 The study was performed to define the effective therapeutic dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (ALA) in a nanoemulsion formulation in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) with topical PDT and to assess the efficacy of topical PDT with a new nanoemulsion formulation of ALA in the treatment of AK.

 The efficacy of BF-200 ALA was calculated by the AK clearance rate, defined as the proportion of AK lesions showing complete remission 12 weeks after PDT treatment.

 Subjects of two study centres provided plasma and urine samples for the quantification of ALA and its metabolite, the active photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX).
