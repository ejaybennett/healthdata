(secondQuint)Comparison of His Bundle Pacing and Bi-Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure With Atrial Fibrillation.

 Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study.

 In the study, both atrial-ventricular node(AVN) ablation and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) implantation are performed with HBP lead implanted and connected with the A port of CRT device.

 Followed with successful AVN ablation, HBP lead and CRT implantation, patients are 1:1 randomized into BiVP and HBP group for 9 months and then crossover for another 9 months.

 The primary end points of the study is the change of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in both HBP and BiV pacing group.
