(fifthQuint)Effects of Ranibizumab to Delay or Regression Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy(NPDR) With DME Assessed by Microaneurysm Changes: A Pilot Study.

 Title of study: Effects of Ranibizumab to delay or regression non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy(NPDR) with DME assessed by microaneurysm changes: A pilot study Study Rationale: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading disease that causes acquired vision loss after 20 by making diabetic macular edema and neovascularization.

 In recent young generation, as prevalence of type 2 diabetes is growing, the burden of sight-threatening retinopathy is increasing on trend.

1 Pathologically, angiogenesis is a main cause that destroys the structure of the eye and induces the visual function disorder as VEGF playing an important role in increasing the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and increasing the permeability of the blood vessels.

2,3 VEGF is made from the endothelial cells of retinal tissue, perivascular cells, pigment endothelial cells by hypoxia.

 And hypoxic condition of intraocular tissues is a key regulator of intra ocular angiogenesis by VEGF, the balance between VEGF and angiogenesis inhibitors determines the neovascular proliferation in diabetic retinopathy.

4 VEGF is also inducing the expression of cell-to-cell contact molecule (intracellular adhesion molecule-1, ICM-1) and the adhesion of leukocytes to help the inflammatory response5, as mediator which destroys the blood retinal barrier, affecting the protein of tight junctions, making a microaneurysm and increasing permeability of capillary, that makes the liquid leakage and macular edema.

5,6 Microanuerysm is the earliest clinical manifestations, the saccular local lesion that perivascular cells protruding in damaged areas on the capillary wall.

 According to Stitt AW et al9, diabetic microaneurysm is non-functioning extrusion of the vascular system from the deep part of inner retinal capillary plexus.

 It is sometimes disappeared by being blocked with blood clots, on the other hand, new microanerysm is occurred in the other vascular bed structure.

 Through these changes, the investigators know the course of a diabetic retinopathy and it is known that the generation rate of microaneurysm is associated with the clinically significant progression of macular edema (CSME) in mild-to-moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy .

10,11 In addition, the number of microanerysm is an important prognostic indicator which can estimate the progression or regression of diabetic retinopathy, as predicting whether becoming better or worse in diabetic retinopathy.

12 Kohner and Sleightholm13 describe this concept at first time in 1986, its association with the number of microvascular flow and the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

 In recent years it is reported that measuring the number of microaneurysm and the turnover rate associated with the appearance or disappearance of microaneurysm, are predictors in progression of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.

14 To delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy and to improve macular edema, the laser photocoagulation have been the important role.

15 Although the laser photocoagulation have had treatment effect in the diabetic retinopathy by reducing the amount of VEGF in micraneurysm and by degenerating the neovascularization after laser therapy, there was a problem that has many limitations - peripheral visual field defects, night blindness, progression of macular edema etc.

, and that the disease does not cured in a good time because of limits of laser therapy due to cataract, vitreous hemorrhage and turbidity.

 As an alternative method to solve these limitations, there is an anti-VEGF therapy.

6 According to a previous study result, intraocular injection of Bevacizumab inhibits occurring of neovascularization by blocking the VEGF receptor .

17 Recently, several studies have been reported that when injected intravitreal anti-VEGF, macular edema is improved and neovascularization is inhibited, by reducing the leakage of neovascularization.

3 Especially, Leicht SF et al18 reported the number of microaneurysms and turnover rate in NPDR(non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) patients injected with Ranibizumab.

 And the result showed entire number of the microaneurysms and turnover rate are decreased, which could be mean the regression of diabetic retinopathy and it could decide the therapeutic effect.

 On this study, through the fluorescein fundus angiography, the average number of microaneurysms was significantly decreased after intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF therapy (p24.

 Fluorescein angiography (FA) will be performed at baseline, at 3 months after baseline and at the last visit(6 months after baseline), and OCT will be performed monthly (baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months from baseline).
