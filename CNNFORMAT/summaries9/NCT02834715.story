 The study has two arms including an intervention arm (test group) and a non-intervention arm (controls) matched for age, sex and body mass index in 2:1 ratio.

 The intervention is made of two phases including 1.

 A mixed meal tolerance test with and without 240 mg of Stevia in a randomized order to evaluate the acute effects; 2.
