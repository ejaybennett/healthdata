(fifthQuint)Couples-Based Mindfulness for Young Breast Cancer Survivors.

 Participants will be young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) and their partners.

 Young breast cancer survivors are those diagnosed at age 45 or younger.

 This study includes stress reducing interventions known to have a positive influence on physical and psychological functioning that will be administered through recorded videos.

 The interventions include watching an hour-long video stress-reduction class, each week, for 8 weeks and practicing guided meditations.

 YBCS participants will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course designed for couples (C-MBSR) or an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course for individuals.

 At the end of the study all participants (regardless of what assignment) will receive both sets of stress-reducing videos.

 Partners of the YBCS assigned to the couples condition will also be asked to watch the 8 C-MBSR videos.
