(thirdQuint)A Trial of PF-06252616 in Ambulatory Participants With LGMD2I.

 This study is a Phase 1b/2, open-label multiple ascending dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD of PF 06252616 in ambulatory adults with LGMD2I.

 The study design is intended to determine the optimal safe and pharmacologically active dose of PF 06252616 in LGMD2I while providing an opportunity for all subjects to receive active drug for a rare and disabling disorder.

 The study will be conducted in three periods: Lead-In, Treatment and Follow-up periods.

 The Lead-In and Follow-up periods will each be 16 weeks to allow an assessment of the change of various outcome measures of this period of time and comparison of change in function before, during and after treatment.
