(thirdQuint)Assessment of Visual Performance Combining a Symfony IOL and a +3.

25 Tecnis Multifocal IOL.

 Each study patient will undergo the same routine cataract extraction procedure in each eye.

 In their dominant eye a Tecnis Symfony IOL will be implanted and in the non dominant eye, a Tecnis +3.

25D Multifocal implanted.

 The surgeries will be within 2 days of each other.

 Every patient will receive same postoperative instructions and medications.

 The aim is to investigate the potential benefits of implanting two different IOL's to give the patient a wider range of near vision with decreased risk of haloing and glare to enable them to be less dependent on reading glasses.

This will be a single center, non comparison clinical trial.

 Fifty study patients will have the Symfony IOL implanted in their dominant eye and a +3,25D Tecnis Multifocal in their non-dominant eye.

 The investigators will be evaluated vision at distance, intermediate and near as well as assessing patient satisfaction and spectacle independence.
