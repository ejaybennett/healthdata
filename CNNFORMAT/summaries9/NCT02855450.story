(thirdQuint)Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of rhNGF Eye Drops Solution Versus Vehicle in Patients With Glaucoma.

 This is a masked, randomized, single-dose, monocentric trial of 60 study participants with chronic primary open angle glaucoma.

 Participants may qualify with either progressive optic neuropathy despite maximal current therapy (i.

e.

 IOP reduction), or with stabilized IOP but diminished vision (central or peripheral).

 Participants with a qualifying eye will be randomized 2:1 to topical recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) therapy or vehicle placebo control.

 Examinations for safety and efficacy will occur one week following initiation of therapy, and at 4, 8, 12 and 32 weeks.

 All participants in either arm will be followed clinically at 4 weeks after cessation of therapy.
