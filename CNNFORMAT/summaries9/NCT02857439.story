(fifthQuint)Creating a Diagnostic Decision Rule for Shoulder Injury: CASH-trial.

 The CASH (Clavicle-AC-Joint-Sub-capital-Humerus) trial is designed as a cross sectional interobserver study.

 It will randomize between first examiner of the patient to determine applicability for triage use and use a list of 19 criteria to determine a clinical decision rule for significant shoulder injuries.

 Method/intervention After admittance to the ED, all consecutive shoulder injury patients will be assessed for eligibility in the study.

 After informed consent is given, the patient will be randomized for first observer (ED physician or triage nurse) to be examined, which means they will be assessed in duplo.

 The patient will be examined by means of a score form, which contains 19 different diagnostic criteria.

 The criteria are grouped: anamnesis, inspection, palpation and pain/range of motion(ROM).

 After completing the list, patients will get a full set of shoulder x-rays: shoulder AP- and axial-view, and clavicle AP and 30' cranio-caudal view.

 The trial participation for the patient will be completed at this point and final diagnosis and treatment are provided by the ED physician according to his/her own findings and interpretation of the radiographs.

 For the study, the radiographs will be reassessed by one consultant radiologist specialized in skeletal trauma.

 Creating a Diagnostic Decision Rule for Shoulder Injury: CASH-trial@highlight

What combination of 6 clinical variables will give the highest specificity for indicating significant shoulder injuries (fractures or dislocations) with a set sensitivity of 97%? Although shoulder trauma is a common injury, there is no clinical decision rule to determine the necessity for radiography for these traumas.

 With this trial the investigators aim to develop such a rule to reduce the amount of radiographs without missing any significant injuries.

 The primary objective is to compose a set of clinical diagnostic criteria predictive of shoulder fractures or dislocations that would reduce the amount of radiographs without missing any significant injuries.

 A second objective is to determine if the clinical decision rule is applicable for triage use.
