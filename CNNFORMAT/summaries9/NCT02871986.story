(firstQuint)Pubertal Induction in Individuals With Hypogonadism.

 The investigators will invite individuals with hypogonadism who require pubertal induction to participate in the study.

 The participants will receive conventional routine oestrogen replacement in the form of transdermal patch.

 The participants will be reviewed every 2 months for a total of 8 months to document uterine, breast and bone assessment.

 This will be completed using a variety of tools.

 After 4 months, the participants will receive an incremental increase in oestrogen dose.
