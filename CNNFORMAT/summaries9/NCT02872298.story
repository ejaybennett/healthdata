(firstQuint)Evaluating the Safety and Feasibility of TLD for the Treatment of Severe Asthma.

 Prospective, multicenter, single-arm (non-randomized) study.

 All patients will undergo a run in period on optimal medical therapy as part of eligibility testing.

 Final determination to initiate treatment will be made after initial airway inspection.

 A total of 30 patients will be treated.

 Inflammatory biomarkers (washes and brushes) will be collected in all patients and bronchial biopsies will be collected from the last 15 patients at the time of treatment and at 90-days post-treatment.

 All patients will be prescribed peri-procedural antibiotics and steroids to minimize procedural risks.

 All patients will be provided a mobile handheld spirometer to measure and record daily peak expiratory flow both before and after treatment to monitor lung function.

 Patient follow-up will be conducted out to 3 years.
