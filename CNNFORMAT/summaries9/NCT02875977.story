 Patients who have been interviewed, examined, and a plan has been made by the treating physicians in the Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery practice will be invited to participate at the end of the visit if the patient and physician mutually agree that PFPT is the treatment modality to pursue.

 If she agrees to participate, she will be consented and randomized.

 If she is randomized to standard counseling, she will be given the standard handout to read.
