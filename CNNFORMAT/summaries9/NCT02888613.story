(thirdQuint)Mini-laparotomy Versus Mini Lumbotomy.

 Following abdominal aortic surgery, post-operative outcomes are considered favorable with a rapid recovery of respiratory, renal functions and intestinal transit, with limited cardiac events.

 Complications are still frequent after the classic open abdominal surgery.

 In abdominal aortic surgery, "mini" abdominal incision has been proposed as an alternative to the classic large surgical approach.

 Two mini surgical approaches are possible: mini lumbotomy with retroperitoneal approach, and mini laparatomy with transperitoneal approach.

 Previous studies have only compared classic versus mini surgical approaches and many are retrospectives studies.

 Pain control through the mini-incision surgery allowed early mobilization of patients, improved lung function, reduced muscle loss, and favoured intestinal motility.

 So far, no study has compared the results of two mini invasive aortic approaches.

 The aim of this prospective randomized study is to compare two mini-invasive surgical approaches and to determine which of them allows the improvement of surgical outcomes with less morbi-mortality.

 Mini-laparotomy Versus Mini Lumbotomy@highlight

This study aims to compare the results of two mini invasive surgical approaches in abdominal aortic surgery: mini lumbotomy with retroperitoneal approach versus mini laparotomy with transperitoneal approach.

 Respiratory and renal functions and recovery of intestinal transit will be assessed after 30 days.

 The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the life quality and morbi-mortality at 30 days, as well as at 6 and 12 months.
