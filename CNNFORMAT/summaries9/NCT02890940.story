(secondQuint)Bridging the Gap: Using Video Art to Document the Human Face of Disease & Predict Quality of Life Assessments in Brain Tumor Patients.

 Through this pilot study, the investigators propose to create new intersections between video art and clinical care by photographing and videotaping patients with brain tumors before, during and after pet therapy sessions.

 This exploratory scholarship has two equally compelling goals.

 First, the artistic component of the project aims to create compelling slow motion video portraits of patients' willing to share their experiences of what it is like to confront such a grave illness.

 The goal is to put a human face on disease and share the endurance of the human spirit through art.

 Second, the scientific component will assess the potential of using facial video portraits as a novel and innovative way to measure Quality of Life (QOL) in lieu of questionnaires in brain tumor patients.

 In addition, the project will evaluate the effects of pet therapy on the QOL of these patients.

The goal of this study is to explore whether facial expression changes in visual portraits correlate with Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire responses before and after pet therapy sessions and to compare scores of QOL questionnaires before and after pet therapy.
