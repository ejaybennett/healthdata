(fifthQuint)Hemodynamic Monitoring in Women Throughout Cesarean Sections.

 This is a prospective, single center study which will be conducted at the Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university hospital.

 The Institutional Review Board has approved this study.

 Two hundred women undergoing cesarean sections will be enrolled after filling out an informed consent form.

 Women will be recruited half an hour preoperatively in the women's surgery waiting room when they aren't experiencing any pain, and aren't under any sedatives.

 Following obtaining an informed consent maternal cardiac output will be monitored.

 The monitoring will be carried out using non invasive NICaS cardiac impedance by the use of two electrodes stickers which are pasted on the wrists for about 6 minutes.

 Monitoring will be done with women lying down or sitting up half an hour preoperatively (in the woman's surgery waiting room) intraoperatively, and postoperatively in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).

 Preoperative data will be compared to intraoperative and postoperative data, and will be analyzed in order to evaluate the dynamic cardiac output changes in women undergoing cesarean sections.

 Recorded data will include: - Demographic and obstetric - age, weight, height, current hemoglobin, co-morbidities, regular medication and other obstetric data.

 - Cardiovascular risk factors - a family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, BMI - Obstetric history - obstetric background (history of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), stillbirths or placental abruption).

 - Threshold of pain according to VAS It should be emphasized that the conduct of the study will not interfere in with cesarean delivery protocol in any way.

 Hemodynamic Monitoring in Women Throughout Cesarean Sections@highlight

In this study we would like to monitor cardiac output by the use of NICAS bioimpedance in women undergoing cesarean section delivery.

 This study is a purely observational study, it will not have any clinical intervention nor will it interfere with standard cesarean delivery protocols in any way.

 This study's primary objective is to evaluate how spinal and general anesthesia influences cardiac output during cesarean section deliveries.

 Secondary endpoints is whether the hemodynamic changes as measured in cardiac output correlate with women's pain, measured by a visual analogue scale(VAS) from o-10.

 (0=representing no pain at all, 10= worse pain imaginable)
