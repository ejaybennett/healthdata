(firstQuint)Analyze the Relationship Between the Density of Fat Tissue and Cellulite With the Lumbar Lordosis Degree.

 There are two types of abdominal fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue which is more superficial, lying above the abdominal muscle wall and visceral adipose tissue, corresponding to the intra-abdominal fat witch is more harmful to health.

 The accumulation of fat tissue differs between genders and age.

 Men have a huge propensity for developing central fat and women accumulate more subcutaneous fat tissue on the gluteal-femoral region.

 Some authors suggest that the accumulation of fat tissue increases with age.

 Several studies have concluded that there is a relationship between the abdominal fat storage and the degree of lumbar curvature.

 In addition, some authors also suggest that there is a relationship between the degree of lumbar lordosis and cellulite, which is related to circulatory changes.

 However these relationships are not yet clarified in the literature.
