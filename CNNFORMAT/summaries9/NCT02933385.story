(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Dfi Sant + Program.

 Lifestyle habits of workers noe represent a personnal concern but also concern the companies.

 Currently there are very few efficacy studies that integrate classical interventions (screening clinics) and online tools in order to obtain sustainable lifestyle changes in workers.

 The current project aimed to evaluate l'efficiency of a combined approach versus more traditional approaches.

 Health Data collected by CAPSANA in the workplace between 2012 and 2014 showed that, out of 4231 workers, 69% should aimed at a more active lifestyle and 74% at a better nutrition profile.

 In addition, 53% of the sampled population was overweight.

 In this context, the current project aimed to motivate and follow individuals towards a healthier lifestyle.

 To do so, the Defi Sante Plus+ will be implemented and tested using various versions (light to more complete) in several compagnies.

 It is planned to compare to a control group individuals receiving light, moderate, high and maximal interventions.

 The content of the interventions involved health assessment, electronic tools (SOS Kitchen and social media platform), health screening, activity monitor provided and sport events.

 At least two compagnies per level of intervention will be assessed.

 It is anticipated that the maximal intervention will yield better results for the activity profile.

 In addition, changes in eating habits toward better habits are expected.
