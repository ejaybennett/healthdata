(thirdQuint)CSI-Glucagon for Prevention of Hypoglycemia in Children With Congenital Hyperinsulinism.

 This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group study with open-label follow-up designed to evaluate the efficacy of CSI-Glucagon cent for the prevention of hypoglycemia with lower IV glucose infusion rates when delivered subcutaneously to patients up to 1 year of age with congenital hyperinsulinism.

 CSI-Glucagon cent is expected to provide a better inpatient treatment option compared to the current standard of care.

 The study will consist of three phases: 1.

 Baseline Phase: First is a baseline stabilization phase during which concomitant therapy with octreotide and diazoxide will be safely weaned and continuous enteric feed will be held constant to the degree possible, with the only factors varying being meal size and IV glucose infusion rate (GIR) adjusted by a set plasma glucose measurement driven algorithm.

 2.

 Blinded, Randomized Treatment Phase: Following the stabilization phase, subjects will be randomly assigned to blinded treatment with either glucagon or placebo, which will be delivered for up to 48 hours with an OmniPod(R) infusion pump with the controller set to a starting basal rate for glucagon of 5 1/2g/kg/hr and GIR adjustments used to maintain euglycemia.

 After 48 hours of blinded treatment, all subjects will transition to open-label active treatment.

 However, if GIR reduction from baseline is cent to manage blood glucose with minimal GIR for up to 28 days of cumulative exposure.

This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with open-label follow-up designed to assess the efficacy of Xeris Glucagon delivered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion to prevent hypoglycemia with lower intravenous glucose infusion rates in children < 1 year of age with congenital hyperinsulinism.
