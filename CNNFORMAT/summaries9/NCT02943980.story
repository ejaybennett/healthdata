(secondQuint)Influenced the Type of Laryngoscopy the Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring During Thyroid Surgery.

 Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) is used in addition to the visual the nerve in thyroid surgery.

 Here, the IONM can be done by placing electrodes on an endotracheal tube.

 In order to guarantee a sufficient signal quality of the IONM, the electrode must be adequately positioned on the glottis.

 The present study pursued the question of whether the conventional direct laryngoscopy always allows visually adequate tube placement.
