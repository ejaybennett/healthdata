(fifthQuint)Eliminating Breast Cancer Surgery in Exceptional Responders With Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy.

 Length of Study: You will receive radiation therapy for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

 Your participation on this study will be over after the follow-up period (5 years after you complete radiation therapy).

 Study Visits: At any point after you have completed chemotherapy and before you begin radiation therapy, you will have an image-guided biopsy of the breast to test for evidence of disease.

 To perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using imaging such as CT, ultrasound, MRI or mammography to collect cells or tissue from an organ, lymph node, or suspected tumor mass.

 The doctor will use the imaging to guide the needle into the area.

 The sample collected will be a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue.

 If the biopsy shows evidence of the disease, you will be scheduled for standard of care surgery and will still receive radiation therapy and remain on this study.

 You would sign a separate consent form for the surgery.

 Within 12 weeks after you have completed chemotherapy, you will have radiation therapy to your breast.

 The doctor will discuss the dose amount and length of the radiation therapy period with you.

 During radiation therapy, you will have weekly visits with your doctor.

 Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) before your first radiation therapy visit, and at 6 months and 1 year after you complete radiation therapy.

 CTC testing checks how many tumor cells are in your blood.

 You will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about your quality of life and symptoms when you first agree to take part in this study, and again at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after your post-chemotherapy biopsy.

 The questionnaires can be completed by mail, email, or during a phone call.

 The questionnaires should take about 15 minutes to complete each time.

 Follow-Up: Every 6 months for 5 years after you finish radiation therapy, you will have a physical exam and mammogram.

 If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI instead of a mammogram at every other 6-month visit.

 Eliminating Breast Cancer Surgery in Exceptional Responders With Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often breast cancer recurs (returns after treatment) in the breast in patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and have had follow-up radiation therapy (but not surgery) and are in complete remission (no evidence of disease).

 This is an investigational study.

 Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

 The study doctor can explain how radiation therapy is designed to work.

 About 50 participants will be enrolled on this multicenter study.

 Up to 50 may take part at MD Anderson.
