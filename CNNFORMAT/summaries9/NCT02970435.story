(thirdQuint)Evaluating the Impact of Video Discharge Instructions for Mohs Surgery Post-Operative Care.

 The Primary Objective of this study is to determine if video discharge instructions, when added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, lead to a decrease in unnecessary phone calls from patients in a Mohs dermatology clinic.

 The Secondary Objectives of this study are to determine if video discharge instructions, when added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, help to improve patients' satisfaction with education materials provided by the clinic, improve patients' knowledge of post-operative management, improve patients' confidence in taking care of their suture site post-operatively, and reduce post-operative anxiety about their suture site.

 This study will be a randomized controlled trial in which the impact of video discharge instructions on patient calls, anxiety, and confidence will be evaluated.

 Patients will be randomized using a permuted block model generated through SAS.
