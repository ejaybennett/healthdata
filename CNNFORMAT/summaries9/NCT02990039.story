(secondQuint)A Tailored Feasibility Study to Increase Physical Activity and to Reduce Sedentary Time.

 The study aimed to assess the feasibility of a brief counseling letter intervention to increase physical activity and to reduce sedentary time in leisure time.

 Following the Intervention Mapping Protocol we developed the counseling letter intervention.

 The intervention is based on the Health Action Process Approach, comprising 3 tailored letters based on separate assessments, delivered over 6 month.

 All participants consented (i) to participate in an examination at the university hospital including standardized measurements of blood pressure, waist and hip circumference, body height and weight as well as blood sample taking, (ii) to fill in a paper-pencil questionnaire, and (iii) to wear an accelerometer for 7 days at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.

 A general population sample of cardiovascular healthy adults was randomly allocated to a control and an intervention group.

 At 5 time points (baseline, 3-month, 6-month, 7-month, and 12-month follow-up) participants of both study groups completed standardized questionnaires.
