(firstQuint)Novel Evaluation of Aspirated Follicular Fluid.

 Ovarian stimulation is a routine part of in vitro fertilization treatment: this process involves an inflammatory response in the developing follicles.

 We still do not completely understand the complex interactions leading to the maturation of the egg and the multiple interactions of the egg with its supporting cells.

 In this study we will assess follicular fluid, letf over after the eggs were identified and separated, for the presence of inflammatory mediators, dendritic cells , vasorin and soluble Flt1.

 The presence and quantification of these factors, as well as their correlation with the size of the aspirated follicle is the focus of this study.
