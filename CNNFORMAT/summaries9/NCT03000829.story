(thirdQuint)Code Blue Outcomes & Process Improvement Through Leadership Optimization Using Teleintensivists-Simulation.

 Only 15-30% of patients who suffer in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survive to hospital discharge.

 Factors associated with lower mortality and improved function include provision of high-quality, minimally-interrupted chest compressions and swift defibrillation of eligible arrhythmias.

 Unfortunately, resuscitation teams provide suboptimal care to 25-40% of IHCA victims.

 A dedicated IHCA team "copilot" may improve resuscitation team performance by providing the team leader with parallel analysis, situational awareness augmentation, action checking, protocol verification, and error correction.

 Critical care physician involvement via a telemedicine link could allow experienced specialists to fill the "copilot" role in a cost and resource-efficient manner, particularly in smaller hospitals with fewer available physicians.

 The current study will evaluate how consultation by an off-site intensive care physician via a telemedicine link influences local IHCA teams' quality of care, team function and provider experience during simulated cardiac arrest events ("mock codes").

This multicenter randomized trial will employ in-situ cardiac arrest simulations ("mock codes") to test whether using telemedicine technology to add an intensive care physician as the "copilot" for cardiac arrest resuscitation teams influences chest compression quality, resuscitation protocol adherence, team function, and provider experience.
