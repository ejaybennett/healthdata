(thirdQuint)Study of Durvalumab Alone or Chemotherapy for Patients With Advanced Non Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms (durvalumab or SOC therapy).

 The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab compared to SoC in terms of OS (Overall Survival) in patients with NSCLC.
