(thirdQuint)Clinical Outcomes After Dry Needling on Cervical Muscles, and Quality of Life, in Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome.

.

 Design: A single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted on patients with FMS.

 Methods: Sixty-four subjects with FMS will be randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving dry needling therapy, or to a control group for myofascial release therapy in the trigger points active or latent in the following pairs of muscles: occipital, splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoid, scalene, trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and multifidus.

 Myofascial trigger points, quality of life, impact of fibromyalgia symptoms, quality of sleep, intensity of pain, anxiety levels, state of depression, impact of fatigue will be recorded at baseline and after four weeks of treatment.

 Clinical Outcomes After Dry Needling on Cervical Muscles, and Quality of Life, in Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome.

@highlight

Objectives: The purpose of the current randomized clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of dry needling versus myofascial release therapy on myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in cervical muscles, quality of life, fatigue, quality of sleep, anxiety and depression in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).
