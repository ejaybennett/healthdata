(secondQuint)An Open-Label Trial of Losartan Potassium in Participants With Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).

 The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of Losartan potassium to see what effects (good and bad) it has on participants and their Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).

 If a subject has Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) the researchers want to see what effects (good or bad) Losartan has on EoE.

 EoE is an inflammatory disease in the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach) that is typically triggered by exposure to certain things in food.

 Connective Tissue Disorders (CTDs) are disorders that affect the connective tissues in the body, such as fat, bone, and cartilage.

 Eosinophils release a protein called TGF-beta.

 Losartan may decrease the amount of the protein and therefore help EoE and CTD.

 Losartan is a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults and children over 6 years of age who have high blood pressure.

 This medication has not been studied in people with EoE.

 An Open-Label Trial of Losartan Potassium in Participants With Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)@highlight

The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Losartan potassium in subjects with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), both those with a connective tissue disorder (CTD) and those without a CTD.
