(thirdQuint)Denosumab and Male Infertility: a RCT.

 INTRODUCTION Infertility is a serious problem estimated to affect 7-26% of all couples globally (1;2).

 Approximately 9% of all newborns were conceived by assisted reproductive techniques in 2013 in Denmark (Danish Fertility Society).

 Impaired semen quality is the causal or contributing factor in almost 50% of all cases of infertility (3;4).

 Today, there exist no treatments that can improve semen quality of most infertile men.

 Instead, the vast majority of infertile couples are treated with assisted reproductive techniques (ART) independently of the aetiology (maternal/paternal) causing the infertility (3;5-8).

 The treatment choice ranges from mild intrauterine inseminations (IUI) to more invasive in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

 ART is successful for more than 70% of all couples.

 However, ART is very expensive and associated with maternal side effects due to the invasive methodology and the need for hormonal treatment, often for several months (9-11).

 Infertility is also a financial burden to society due to the costs of ART to maintain an acceptable annual birth rate.

 Fertility potential determined by semen quality is established already as a fetus (12).

 In case the testes don't develop normally, reduced semen quality in adulthood will be the result as a result of impaired Sertoli cell function.

 Up until today it has barely been investigated whether intervention during adulthood can improve semen quality.

 Our recent studies using both human testis and Vitamin D receptor knock-out mice revealed that the vitamin D regulated bone factor RANKL is expressed in the testis (13;14).

 This is a novel finding, because up until now RANKL has only been known to affect bone homeostasis and to some extend influence the immune system, inflammation and lactation (15;16).

 In the skeleton RANKL is expressed in osteoblasts and binds to its specific receptor RANK in osteoclasts to induce osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption (17).

 This activation is controlled by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which binds to the ligand domain of RANKL and thus inhibits RANK activation and osteoclastogenesis, ultimately reducing bone resorption (18).

 This knowledge has been utilized into development of an OPG-analogue drug, a recombinant human monoclonal IGg2 antibody Denosumab (Prolia by Amgen), which inhibits RANKL and thereby bone resorption and is indicated for use in both osteoporosis and bone metastases (19;20).

 Prolia has in several clinical studies shown to be safe and is approved as treatment for osteoporosis in both men and women (21-24).

 Newer data indicate that RANKL/OPG may be involved in regulation of pancreatic function, insulin and glucagon production which support a possible indirect effect on reproduction through bone-pancreatic-gonadal axis.

 AIM OF STUDY To determine the significance of systemic RANKL inhibition for male reproduction by investigating whether Denosumab (Prolia) can increase semen quality and particularly to identify the group of men that will benefit from the treatment.

 DESIGN Single center, prospective randomized double blinded* clinical controlled intervention.

 Patients and methods: 95 infertile men, otherwise healthy, will be recruited among men referred to investigation for infertility at the outpatient clinic at Dpt.

 of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshopitalet.

 Neither choosing to participate, nor declining, will affect further outpatient clinic treatment.

 The 95 participants are randomly allocated to receiving either - Denosumab s.

c.

 injection 60 mg x1, or - Placebo, Sodium Chloride s.

c.

 injection x 1 All participants deliver semen samples, blood samples and have DXA-scan performed before and after intervention.

 All receive supplements with Vitamin D and calcium to avoid hypocalcaemia, a known, temporary side effect to Denosumab.

 *double blinded studies require that placebo and active substance are identical.

 Placebo can only be obtained from Amgen and we were not able to receive or purchase placebo.

 Instead the study will be double blinded to patient, medical doctors and all who participates in data-handling and analyses - only one nurse giving the medicine will be unblinded.

 She will know whether she injects active substance or placebo.

 Inclusion criteria - Men > 18 years of age referred due to infertility in need for further investigation with - Sperm concentration 0,05 mio.

 VDB, 24,25OH2 - Difference in infection rate in the two groups SETTING, SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND RECRUITMENT Participants will be included among men referred to the Department of Growth and Reproduction (dept.

 of GR), Rigshospitalet (RH) for evaluation of male infertility This is a prospective, double blinded, two-arm randomized controlled trial.

 Group of intervention: Each man will receive Denosumab 60 mg x 1 sc at day 1 only Group receiving placebo: Will follow the same chain of events, although Denosumab will be replaced with saline All men will be offered the same vitamin D and calcium supplementation starting prior to initiation of the treatment start of Denosumab or placebo: vitamin D 15 microgram and calcium 400 mg once daily.

 PARTICIPANTS Screening of ~500 infertile men will be performed.

 The investigators assume that ~300 men will be excluded and ~100 men do not wish to participate.

 Thus, 95 men will be included in the study and half will be randomized to active treatment.

 The investigators expect a small drop out (<5) because of high motivation and no adverse effects.

 ANALYSIS AND INTERVENTION Reproductive hormones and semen will be analyzed at dept.

 of GR, Rigshospitalet.

 ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All the patients will have full-filled their investigation, before they are invited to the study.

 They will be informed of potential adverse effects, and they can leave the trial at any point without any consequences.

 Denosumab is proven to be safe in several randomized studies, and is already approved by both FDA and EMA.

 All side effects will be closely monitored, registered and in case of either unexpected frequency of adverse effects or unexpected clinical complications it will be published.

 Based on previous fertility studies at our department we expect a large proportion of the out clinic-patients will wish to participate.

 In our opinion the outlined study is ethical sound, and we believe that in order to generate future recommendations, randomized clinical trials are necessary.

 PUBLICATION OF RESULTS All results, positive or negative will be submitted to peer reviewed scientific journals.

 Data will successively be obtained and transferred to a statistical database.
