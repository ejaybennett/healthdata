(secondQuint)Twice Daily Treatment With Amoxicillin for Non-severe Community Acquired Pneumonia.

.

 A single-center, non-blinded, pragmatic, randomized-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial will be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED.

 All patients three months old to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of non-severe community acquired pneumonia based on respiratory complaints and a pulmonary infiltrate identified by trained paediatricians or emergency physicians will be eligible to the present study.

 Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive either amoxicillin (90mg/kg per day) in twice or thrice daily regimen.

 Primary outcome will be treatment failure within 10 days of enrolment as defined by hospitalisation, need for a change in antibiotic (persistence of fever at 72 hours, clinical deterioration, comorbid condition or development of serious adverse reactions) and death.

 ED revisits within 72 hours, second course of antibiotic and clinical recurrence rates will be evaluated in the follow-up assessments as well as percent of adverse events encountered, number of days missed (work, school or daycare), coverage vaccination rate, protocol adherence and patient and parental satisfaction.

 The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach.

 Per-protocol analysis will also be carried to compare the failure rate.

 Accounting to a maximal 10% drop-off rate, a sample size of 685 participants per arm was calculated to have a power of 90% to identify a difference of 5% with an alpha value of 0.

 Twice Daily Treatment With Amoxicillin for Non-severe Community Acquired Pneumonia.

@highlight

The aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a twice-daily antibiotic regimen is non-inferior to a thrice-daily regimen for the treatment of non-severe community acquired pneumonia in children presenting at a paediatric Emergency Department (ED).
