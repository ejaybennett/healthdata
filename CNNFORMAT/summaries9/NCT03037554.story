(thirdQuint)The Effects of Lateralized Thermal Sleepwear on Sleep, Skin Temperature and Skin Moisture in Menopausal Women.

 Sixteen menopausal women who have given informed consent to participate will be medically screened to rule out physiological sleep disorders.

 Sleep schedules will be regulated to the average bedtime of a two-week baseline sleep log.

 Subjects will undergo two six-night, home-based monitoring phases, one an experimental and one a control condition, separated by a washout period of at least two weeks.

 The order of conditions will be counterbalanced between subjects in double-blind fashion.

 In the experimental condition subjects will wear sleepwear constructed of two fabric types arranged bilaterally, with typical cotton spandex insulating material on one side and specialized conductive material on the other.

 In the control condition subjects will wear sleepwear that is similarly lateralized in terms of appearance but constructed with typical cotton spandex insulating material on both sides.

 Ambulatory monitoring will include body position, EEG, actigraphy, skin temperature at multiple proximal sites, and sternal skin moisture.

 Subjective scales of insomnia severity and menopausal symptoms will also be employed.
