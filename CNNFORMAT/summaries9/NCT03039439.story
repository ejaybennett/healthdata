(secondQuint)Molecular and IHC Profiling of PTH Tumors to Evaluate Targeted Agents.

 The purpose of this study is dual-fold: 1.

 To determine the differences in clinical behavior and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers between parathyroid carcinoma (PC), atypical neoplasm (AN) and parathyroid adenoma (PA).

 This will allow to use these markers as a diagnostic and screening tool when evaluating parathyroid tumors.

 2.

 To determine which potential genes can be used in patients with parathyroid tumors for diagnostic purposes.

 Genomic analysis of tumor samples will be performed to identify molecular aberrations for which novel targeted therapies have been recently developed.

 Molecular and IHC Profiling of PTH Tumors to Evaluate Targeted Agents@highlight

This is a pilot biomarker study designed to compare frequencies of mutations between groups of malignant, benign and normal tissue or blood of patients with parathyroid disease and identify the potential genes showing molecular aberrations as other types of cancer.
