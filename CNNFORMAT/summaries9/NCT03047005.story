(thirdQuint)Behavioral and Pharmacologic Treatment of Binge Eating and Obesity: Maintenance Therapy.

 Binge eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder, is associated strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment.

 Improved treatments for patients with obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight loss.

 This study (maintenance stage) RCT will provide new and novel findings from a controlled test, amongst responders to acute treatments, whether NB medication results in superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo.

 This is the first controlled test of maintenance pharmacotherapy for BED and will be only the third RCT for BED of any medication with follow-up after medication discontinuation.
