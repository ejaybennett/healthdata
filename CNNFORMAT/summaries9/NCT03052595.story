(thirdQuint)Multiple Sclerosis: The Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in IR Resistance.

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most common neurological diseases, often leading to disability of the patients.

 The MS pathogenesis includes vascular and inflammatory components, however recently also the role of mitochondrial dysfunction being a hot topic in neurodegeneration.

 Current project is based on our previous project results, where we found signs of insulin resistance (IR) with hyperinsulinemia in patients with MS, which seems not to be related to chronic inflammation or low physical activity.

 Therefore aim of present project is to elucidate impact of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of impaired insulin action and its role in the neurodegenerative process.

 To test our hypothesis we will assess mitochondrial function, endothelial function, changes in membrane proteins and function of autonomic nervous system.

 Those parameters will be measured non-invasively and in samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid and skeletal muscle.

 MS patients will be examined at the time of diagnosis and after 12 months of treatment, healthy subjects will be used as controls.

 We expect elucidation of insulin resistance cause and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathogenesis of disease.

 Potential outcome of the project could be the answer, if pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention might lead to improvement of mitochondrial function and therefore represent a new approach to prevent MS progression.
