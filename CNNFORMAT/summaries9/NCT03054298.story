(secondQuint)CAR T Cells in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers.

 This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells in 5 cohorts with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose escalation design.

 Cohort 1 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

 Cohort 2 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day - 4 to day -2).

 Cohort 3 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

 Cohort 4 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2).

 Cohort 5 subjects (N=up to 6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 by intrapleural infusion (IP) through an indwelling pleural catheter without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

 Subjects in this cohort will be enrolled after safety is demonstrated at this dose level by completion of Cohorts 1 and 2.

 Subjects in Cohort 5 may be enrolled in parallel to Cohorts 3 and 4.

 The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0-1 DLT occurs in 6 evaluable subjects tested within the dose range of this study.

 In order to gather additional data for the MTD dose level, the respective cohorts (both with and without lymphodepletion) may be expanded to treat up to 6 evaluable subjects.

 Adverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period.

 CAR T Cells in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers@highlight

Phase I study to establish safety and feasibility of intravenous or intrapleural administered lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells with or without lymphodepletion.

 Intravenous administration of huCART-meso cells is planned with or without cyclophosphamide as lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
