(firstQuint)Prevalence of NNSH in a Group of Egyptian Children Aged 3-8 Years Old in Giza Governorate: A Cross Sectional Study.

.

 Several studies have reported on the prevalence of non-nutritive sucking behaviors among infants and young children in different populations.

 Non-nutritive sucking is regarded as a normal part of development, and early studies of its prevalence generally found that 70-90% of children had some history of a non-nutritive sucking habit.

 Like these early studies, most recent studies have used retrospective methods to assess the prevalence of non-nutritive sucking habits.

 Prolonged duration of non-nutritive sucking behaviors may have consequences in regard to the developing orofacial structures and occlusion.

 Little is known as to why some children have sucking habits beyond the first 2 to 3 years of life.

 Prevalence of NNSH and associated factors in Egyptian children might be different.
