(secondQuint)A Randomized Prospective Multicenter Trial of Early Versus Late Drain Removal After Pancreaticoduodenectomy.

 The objective of this randomized prospective multicenter study is to investigate the association between the time of removal of drain after pancreaticoduodenectomy and incidence of abdominal complications, such as intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic leakage.

 We unite six pancreatic surgery center in Beijing.

 Patients with pancreatic and periampullar tumors who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) are recruited into the study if amylase value in drain(s) is less than 5000 U/L on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3.

 After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients are randomly allocated to early or late drain removal group on POD 3.

 In the group A, drain(s) are removed on POD 3, whereas in group B drain is removed on POD 5 or beyond.

 The primary outcomes are the incidence of intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic fistula; the secondary outcomes include intra-abdominal bleeding, delayed gastric emptying, pulmonary complications, and length of hospital stay.

The aim of this randomized prospective multicenter study is to demonstrate the hypothesis that early removal of drain can reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula and intra-abdominal infection after pancreaticoduodenectomy , when compared with later removal of drain.
