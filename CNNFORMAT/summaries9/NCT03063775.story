(thirdQuint)Proof of Concept: Socket Seal.

 In a proof of concept 5 groups are compared in preserving soft- and hard tissue after tooth extraction in the esthetic zone: 1.

 Mucograft(R) Seal + Bio-Oss(R) 2.

 Free Gingival Graft (FGG) + Bio-Oss(R) 3.

 Free Gingival Graft + Gelatine sponge (Spongostan(R)) 4.

 Spongostan(R)+ Mucograft(R) Seal 5.

 Spongostan(R) Volumetric changes of hard and soft tissues are recorded , 2/4/8 weeks and 3/6/12 months after extraction.

 Proof of Concept: Socket Seal@highlight

It is planned to evaluate if a porcine collagen matrix (Mucograft Seal) is offering comparable results to free gingival grafts (FGG) in post-extraction tissue preservation.

 If so, this would provide a substantial benefit to the patient as the second intervention on the palate and the subsequent morbidity of the donor site is omitted.
