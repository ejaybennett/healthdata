(fifthQuint)Fast Track Surgery for Abdominal Surgery in Rwanda.

 Fast track surgery (FTS) uses a multifaceted approach to reduce the stress response to surgery, thereby improving outcomes and decreasing length of hospital stay.

 The core elements of FTS include: epidural or regional anesthesia, peri-operative fluid management, minimally invasive techniques, optimal pain control, early initiation of oral feeding and early mobilization.

 The combination of these approaches has led to a significant reduction in complication rates, morbidity and mortality rates, duration of hospital stay and costs of hospitalization, and greatly improved postoperative recovery The main aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of FTS in the Rwandan surgical setting and to demonstrate the benefits of FTS.

 This randomized control trial was conducted in CHUK over a period of three months (October - December, 2015).

 For patients in the FTS arm, the study investigator would assess patients on a daily basis and work with the primary surgical team.

 The study investigator would prompt the primary surgical team for early feeding, mobilization, pain control and fluid management recommendations.

 Data were collected on variables including postoperative analgesia, mobilisation, resuming oral feeding, hospital stay and complications.

 The primary outcome was duration of postoperative hospital stay and secondary outcome was major complications.

Fast Track Surgery (FTS) was started in colorectal surgery, but was later applied to other surgical fields.

 Core elements include epidural or regional anaesthesia, perioperative fluid management, minimally invasive surgical techniques, pain control, and early mobilization and feeding.

 Beneficial effects of FTS include reduced costs, early hospital discharge, and increased availability of hospital beds.

The main aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of FTS in the Rwandan surgical setting and to demonstrate the benefits of FTS.

 it is study comparing the management of surgical patients using traditional management and fast track surgery.

 the study was done on patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery only
