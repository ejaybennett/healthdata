(fifthQuint)Sleep Quality in High School Students With Asthma.

 Sleep quality among adolescents is poor and asthma's impact is significant among adolescents.

 Asthma control is an important risk factor for poor sleep and poor academic performance.

 In addition, poor asthma control, poor sleep hygiene, and poor sleep quality are more likely in urban settings.

 Interventions to promote sleep quality by targeting both asthma control and sleep hygiene in this vulnerable population are lacking.

 To adapt ASMA and Sleep-Smart, the investigators will use a 3-step iterative process that will consist of (1) interviewing high school students and their caregivers, (2) interviewing high school teachers and (3) conducting separate focus groups with students and caregivers.

 The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable.

 This study is a multi-site trial and collaboration between Columbia University Medical Center and Rhode Island Hospital (RIH).

 Sleep Quality in High School Students With Asthma@highlight

The overall goal of this project is to develop and to preliminarily validate a novel intervention to be delivered in the high school setting that integrates two evidence-based, school-based interventions for urban adolescents with proven efficacy: (1) Asthma Self-Management for Adolescents (ASMA), an intervention for adolescents with uncontrolled asthma and (2) the Sleep-Smart Program (Sleep-Smart), which focuses on sleep hygiene and behaviors in urban adolescents.

 The aim for Phase I is to develop and integrate school-based interventions to improve asthma self-management and sleep hygiene in urban high school students via interviews.

 The aims for Phase II are: (1) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention procedures; and (2) to assess the preliminary evidence of the effects of the intervention on improving sleep quality in urban high school students with persistent asthma over a 2-month follow-up period.

 This record is for Phase I only.
