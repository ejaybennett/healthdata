(fifthQuint)P53 Mutational Status and cf HPV DNA for the Management of HPV-associated OPSCC.

 The proposed study is a follow-up study to LCCC 1120 and 1413.

 The investigators have shown that de-intensification is efficacious in these two phase II studies.

 A major question is whether the investigators can de-intensify in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer who have smoking histories.

 The investigators' hypothesis is that genomic profiling of patients' tumors (specifically for p53 mutations) will help in triaging patients to de-intensification versus standard of care.

 Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC will be enrolled regardless of smoking history and p53 mutational status will be assessed in patients with a smoking history.

 The investigators will use the same de-intensification chemoradiotherapy regimen already evaluated in LCCC 1120 and 1413 in patients with HPV-associated OPSCC who have a minimal smoking history and in patients with a smoking history but with wild-type p53.

 Patients with a smoking history who have mutated p53 will not receive de-intensified chemoradiotherapy, but instead will receive standard doses.

 The hypothesis is that by using genomics in the patients with a significant smoking history, the investigators will better select those who can be safely de-intensified.

 Circulating free HPV DNA (cf-HPV-DNA) will also be prospectively assessed from blood samples.

 P53 Mutational Status and cf HPV DNA for the Management of HPV-associated OPSCC@highlight

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether genomic based risk-stratification can be used in deciding whether to de-intensify in patients with Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) with > 10 pack years smoking history.

 Hypothesis: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, > 10 pack years smoking history, and non-mutated p53 will have similar 2 year progression-free survival (PFS) as patients with < 10 pack years smoking history.
