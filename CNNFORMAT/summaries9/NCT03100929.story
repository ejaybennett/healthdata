(fifthQuint)Nuchal Cord Detection in Sonographic Evaluation by a First Year Resident.

.

 Patients undergoing elective cesarean section will undergo a routine ultrasound examination during which fetal heart rate, fetal presentation and nuchal cord presence will be documented.

 During surgery, after the fetus is delivered, presence or lack of nuchal cord will be documented.

 The aim of the study is to show that minimal sonographic training may assist even an unexperienced sonographist in detection of such a subtle yet important phenomenon.

 The study will be performed utilizing the newest resident in the OBGYN department.

 Nuchal Cord Detection in Sonographic Evaluation by a First Year Resident.

@highlight

The investigators aim to prove that minimal sonographic training for nuchal cord detection in an unexperienced first year medical resident is more than enough to detect the phenomenon.

 Patients undergoing elective cesarean section will undergo a routine ultrasound (that is performed to detect the fetal heart rate and the fetal presentation) during which the resident will attempt to detect nuchal cord.

 The resident will then attend the patient`s surgery to verify the findings.
