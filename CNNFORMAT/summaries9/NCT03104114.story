(fifthQuint)Pharmacist-led Intervention on Adherence in Patients Undergoing Treatment With an Oral Oncology Medication.

 Boston Medical Center's Specialty Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP) will focus on improving adherence and persistence through the implementation of a high-touch program.

 In order to be eligible for the program, patients must be initiated on oral chemotherapy or targeted therapy with a life expectancy >6 months.

 All patients will be administered a Patient Activation Measure (PAM) 13 survey prior to consultation.

 Patients eligible for our program will receive a 30-60 minute pharmacist consultation prior to initiation of treatment.

 The pharmacy consultation includes, but is not limited to the dissemination of medical information utilizing a standardized counseling checklist, supplying of patient education materials, pharmacist-led interventions, and/or the use of other materials or devices that may improve patient adherence.

 All counseling checklists and monitoring will be standardized and approved by a multidisciplinary oncology team.

 At week 1, 2, and 4, patients will be contacted by the pharmacist for an assessment of treatment goals; monthly contacts will continue thereafter by either a specialty pharmacist or certified pharmacy technician.

 Scheduled follow up visits with the consulting pharmacist will be made at months 3, 6 and 12.

 Prior to the scheduled pharmacist consultation, patients will be administered the PAM 13 survey.

 Patients with a treatment gap >37 days will be referred to the consulting pharmacist for follow up.

 The consulting pharmacist will attempt to contact the patient via telephone for an assessment of adherence and adverse drug-related events.

 If patients experience a treatment gap >45, then the patient will be contacted and scheduled for a pharmacist consultation, additionally, the prescribing provider will be notified.

 All consultations and interventions will be documented in the hospital's electronic medical record system, EPIC(R).

 Pharmacist-led Intervention on Adherence in Patients Undergoing Treatment With an Oral Oncology Medication@highlight

Boston Medical Center provides care to cancer patients on oral cancer medications through the use of Boston Medical Center Specialty Pharmacy (BMC SP).

 The use of oral medications in cancer treatments is relatively new and unfortunately, very little is known about adherence in cancer patients.

 This study will evaluate the influence of a pharmacist-driven medication management program on adherence and persistence rates.

 Boston Medical Center's Specialty Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP), will utilize a high-touch counseling model involving clinical pharmacist that will focus on educating patients about their oral cancer treatments.

 The program will require face-to-face counseling with a pharmacist, through the use of a proven patient teaching tool, prior to initiating treatment with oral oncolytic treatments and, periodically thereafter, based on protocol.

 This study will help improve our understanding of the role of the pharmacist in cancer patients.

 In addition, the study will help identify independent factors that may contribute or impact adherence.

 The outcomes of this program will be compared to a historical control group of patients that have already received treatment for their cancer through the BMC Specialty Pharmacy.
