(thirdQuint)Thoracic Spine Thrust Manipulation Compared to Sham Manipulation in Individuals With Subacromial Pain Syndrome.

 Thoracic spine thrust manipulation has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (subacromial impingement).

 It remains unknown if individuals respond differently to different manipulation techniques.

 This study examines the immediate effects of these different thoracic spine thrust manipulation techniques on scapular kinematics (upward rotation and posterior tilt, specifically), pectoralis minor muscle length, and scapulothoracic muscle force production for the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior.

 Additionally, the short-term effects on pain and function were examined through use of the Penn Shoulder Score (PSS).

 Thoracic Spine Thrust Manipulation Compared to Sham Manipulation in Individuals With Subacromial Pain Syndrome@highlight

This study evaluates the immediate effects of a supine upper thoracic spine thrust manipulation, seated upper thoracic spine thrust manipulation, and sham manipulation for individuals with subacromial pain syndrome.

 The participants were randomized to receive one of the three interventions and baseline measures for the dependent variables were repeated immediately after the delivery of the intervention.
