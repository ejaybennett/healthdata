(thirdQuint)Collabri Flex - Effect of Collaborative Care for People With Anxiety in General Practice.

 The Collabri Flex model for Collaborative Care takes point of departure in the earlier study Collabri.

 It is changed according to gathered information under the first study of the Collabri model in order to achieve a Danish Collaborative Care model easier to implement.

 The aims of Project Collabri Flex are to: - Develop a flexible model for collaborative care (the Collabri Flex model) for patients with anxiety.

 - Study the effects of this Collabri Flex model against consultation liaison in a randomized design on selected outcomes.

 In Collabri the treatment is in line with a set of general treatment principles relevant for collaborative care interventions.

 The patients in the intervention group are offered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation and medication according to at stepped care model by a care manager refering to the general practitioner.

 The Collabri Flex study is set up as a researcher-blinded individually randomized controlled trial with participation of an intervention group (treatment according to the Collabri Flex model) and a consultation liaison group.

 This study will contribute with new knowledge on collaborative care interventions in a Scandinavian context.
