(firstQuint)CBP501, Cisplatin and Nivolumab in Advanced Refractory Tumors.

 This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b study of CBP501/cisplatin/nivolumab combination administered once every 21 days to patients with advanced solid tumors.

 The study will be conducted in two parts.

 The first part of the study involves dose-escalation, in which successive cohorts of three patients (expanded to six patients in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity) will receive escalating doses of CBP501 and/or cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, based on tolerability observed during the first 21 days of treatment.

 The second part of the study involves treatment of expansion cohorts of 9 to 12 patients each in specific indications (to be specified by protocol amendment) to confirm the tolerability of treatment at the RD and evaluate evidence of anti-tumor activity in specific indications.
