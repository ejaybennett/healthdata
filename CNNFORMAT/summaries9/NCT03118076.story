(fifthQuint)The Effect of Dexmedetomidine as an Adjuvant for Lower Limb Nerve Blocks.

 Peripheral nerve block has been recommended as the technique for postoperative pain management because it provides equivalent analgesia but with fewer adverse effects than either systemic or epidural analgesia.

 The use of clonidine, a partial 2 adrenoceptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the duration and analgesia in peripheral nerve blockade.

 Dexmedetomidine is a more selective and shorter-acting 2 adrenergic receptor.

However, its use in femoral and common peroneal nerve blocks has not been described.

 In this study, we investigated the effect of adding dexmedetomidine as additive in femoral and common peroneal nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia.

 Patients, diagnosed as oromaxillofacial tumor and undergoing elective free fibular or anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction, were divided into two groups in a randomized, double-blind fashion.

 For patients with free fibular flaps harvested, femoral nerve block and common peroneal nerve with ropivacaine were administered.

 For patients with anterolateral thigh flaps harvested, femoral nerve block with ropivacaine was administered.

In Group R, nerve blocks were administered with 0.

3% ropivacaine.

 In Group RD, nerve blocks were administered with 0.

3% ropivacaine and 50 1/2g dexmedetomidine.

The primary endpoints were the onset time and duration of sensory blocks.

 The secondary endpoints were heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), sedation level, the duration of motor blocks.
