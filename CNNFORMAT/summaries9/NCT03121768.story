(secondQuint)A New Prognostic Model for Predicting the Outcome of Patients With Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC).

 Bladder urothelial carcinoma is the most common cancer of the urinary tract and is the 7th most common cancer in males and the 7th most common cancer in females.

 Most of newly diagnosed cases of urothelial cancer of the bladder are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), and including stages Ta, T1, or Carcinoma in situ (CIS).

 The initial management is endoscopic resection, aiming at complete removal of all visible papillary lesions, and accurate staging of the bladder tumor.

 The future plan is determined based on the results of histopathological diagnosis and included either re-resection or adjuvant immunotherapy.

 The incidence of recurrence and progression to muscle invasive disease after resection of NMIBC reaches up to 42 % and 21%, respectively, concluding that alternative treatments are urgently required.

 Therefore, the development of prognostic models is of ultimate importance to minimize long-term morbidity and improve the outcome.

 The most commonly used stratification systems are the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables and the The Club Urologico Espanol de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO) scoring model.

 The EORTC risk tables have been constructed based on 2596 patients diagnosed with Ta/T1 urothelial bladder carcinoma.

 Nevertheless, there were low number of patients treated with BCG (7%), as well as immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapy ( 3 cm, and older age were independent predictors for progression and cancer specific survival.

 Currently, all publications investigating the outcome after treatment of NMIBC lack several factors including the re-staging TUR, maintenance BCG therapy, inclusion of other highly prognostic factors e.

g.

 smoking, inflammatory biomarkers, depth of lamina invasion.

 Therefore, this protocol is constructed to combine all clinically affordable biomarkers into a prognostic model for predicting the outcome after NMIBC.
