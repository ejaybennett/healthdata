(fifthQuint)ADVANCE Study of DTG + TAF + FTC vs DTG + TDF + FTC and EFV + TDF+FTC in First-line Antiretroviral Therapy.

 This is an open label randomised, non-inferiority (10% non-inferiority margin), phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of DTG (50 mg once daily [QD]) administered in combination with TAF (25 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) compared to DTG (50 mg QD) administered in combination with TDF (300 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) and compared to EFV (600 mg QD) administered in combination with TDF (300 mg QD) and FTC (200 mg QD) over 96 weeks in patients with HIV-1 starting first-line ART.

 Approximately 1110 male and female patients infected with HIV-1 who are eligible for first-line ART will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (approximately 370 patients per treatment group) to Treatment Group 1 (DTG + TAF + FTC) or Treatment Group 2 (DTG + TDF + FTC) or Treatment Group 3 (EFV + TDF + FTC).

 To ensure adequate representation of adolescents (12 - 18 years) in any treatment group, randomisation will be stratified according to age greater or less than 18 years.

 The study includes screening and baseline visits, 8 study visits from Week 4 to Week 84, and an end of study visit at Week 96 (figure 1).

 Study medication pill counts will be performed at each follow up visit.
