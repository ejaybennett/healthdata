(thirdQuint)The Effect of Non-surgical Periodontal Therapy on Adverse Birth Outcomes Randomized Controlled Trial.

 Approximately two-thirds of pregnant Pakistani women suffer from periodontal disease a common inflammatory disease of the soft tissues surrounding the tooth.

 It was demonstrated that periodontitis among pregnant women is significantly associated with preterm birth and low birth weight.

 Pakistan has a high prevalence of these adverse birth outcomes therefore; identifying an intervention is of prime importance and may have social and economic benefits.

 Non-surgical periodontal therapy is affordable and amenable to people and thus seems to be an intervention which may prove to be of benefit in a population where the dental services are available.

 It has been recommended in systematic reviews and Meta analysis that Randomized Controlled Trials are now required to establish whether the removal of inflammatory factors by scaling and root planning are effective in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight.
