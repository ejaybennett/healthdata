(firstQuint)A Study on a Multidimensional Prediction Model for Rupture Risk of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms.

 An intracranial aneurysm is swelling along a blood vessel.

 Ruptured aneurysms, the most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, can be catastrophic and have high mortality and morbidity rates.

 The key points of prevention and cure of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are: (1) clarify the natural history of UIA patients and (2) clarify the risk factors of aneurysms.

 Furthermore, understanding how to reduce the rate of rupture, and thus reduce patient mortality, has become a key problem to be solved in this field.

 The aim of this study is to establish a multidimensional model for predicting the rupture of unruptured aneurysms.

 The investigators will first establish a prospective cohort of patients with UIA from 20 different grade centers selected randomly in China, and collect baseline information for each patient.

 Multidimensional data will be acquired in follow-up assessments.

 Based on the original prediction system and the central laboratory and international uniform experimental technical specification, the risk factors related to the rupture of UIA, including genes, biomarkers, high resolution magnetic resonance images (HRMRI), hemodynamics and clinical features will be analyzed.

 These data will then be used to further improve the prediction model of UIA rupture risk.

 After refinement of the model, the evidence-based prediction will provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of aneurysms with high rupture risk, so as to improve the prevention and control of UIA and avoid uninformed treatment.
