(fifthQuint)ENgaging in Advance Care Planning Talks Group Visit Intervention.

 This pilot feasibility randomized controlled study will determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the ENACT Group Visit intervention compared to a comparison arm.

 The ENACT Group Visit intervention aims to engage patients in an interactive discussion of key ACP concepts and support patient-initiated ACP actions (i.

e.

 choosing decision-maker(s), deciding on preferences during serious illness, discussing preferences with decision-makers and healthcare providers, and documenting advance directives).

 The group visits involve two 2-hour sessions, one month apart, facilitated by a geriatrician and a social worker.

 The ENACT Group Visit is based on an intervention manual that guides the structure, facilitator considerations, session format, and documentation and billing details.

 The discussions include sharing experiences related to ACP, considering values related to serious illness, choosing a surrogate decision-maker(s), flexibility in decision making, and having conversations with decision-makers and healthcare providers.

 The facilitators support an interactive discussion that promotes opportunities for patients to learn from others' experiences.
