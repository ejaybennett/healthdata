(fifthQuint)Assessment of TMAO Formation With Egg Intake Versus Choline Supplement in a Healthy Population.

 Epidemiological data in short term studies, suggests that egg intake does not increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

 In fact, eggs are a great source of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine) where choline has many metabolic roles, specially in lipid metabolism and cell membrane structure.

 Choline is present in the diet as free choline, which is absorbed in the small intestines, or choline esters, which is absorbed intact primarily through the lymphatic system.

 In addition, recent evidence suggests that the choline found in eggs may be metabolized by intestinal microbes into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a compound that may increase the risk for CVD.

 However, it is not known to what extent egg intake may contribute to plasma TMAO concentrations.

 Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the impacts of daily intake of 3 eggs versus a choline supplement on plasma TMAO as well as other biomarkers for CVD risk, with the goal of determining if the same amount of choline given as phosphatidylcholine from eggs will increase plasma choline levels without a concomitant increase in plasma TMAO, such that CVD risk is not negatively impacted.

The objective of this study is to determine the effects of consuming either 3 eggs per day as compared to a daily choline supplement (choline bitartrate, 397.

5 mg choline/day) on plasma concentrations of High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in young, healthy individuals.

 The goal is to determine if choline given as phosphatidylcholine (eggs) will lead to a different TMAO response when compared to choline in free supplemental form.
