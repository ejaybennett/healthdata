(fifthQuint)Connecting Youth and Young Adults to Optimize ART Adherence: YouTHrive Efficacy Trial.

 Youth between the ages of 13 and 24 accounted for 22% of all new HIV infections in 2015.

 Less than half (44%) of youth living with HIV (YLWH) in the US are estimated to be virally suppressed, which is a well recognized critical factor in individual health and non-infectiousness.

 Given the high demands of social identity development during adolescence and early adulthood, as well as the increasing use of social media as important and influential communication channels, there is an ongoing need for innovative programs that leverage current communication channels to foster social support for ART adherence behaviors.

 The investigators developed a program first called Thrive With Me (TWM) as an intervention that leverages enhanced peer-to-peer interaction, ART adherence reminders and self-monitoring, and ART and HIV informational content to improve ART adherence.

 Given youth's broad acceptance and adoption of many of the components of the TWM intervention, and the critical need for novel and scalable ART adherence interventions for this population, we have adapted TWM for a younger audience and all genders in a program called YouTHrive (YT).

 Focus groups will provide insights into what features and functions of the current TWM study youth like and dislike to assist intervention adaptation.

 The investigators will conduct focus groups in three cities (Houston, Bronx, and Chicago) and will recruit up to 16 YLWH per city, and use the results to develop the YT intervention.

 Ahead of the RCT, the investigators will conduct usability testing on YT to gain feedback about the developed intervention.

 The investigators will recruit 12 YLWH in six cities to use the intervention for a two-week period for usability testing.

 The randomized controlled efficacy trial will compare YT (N=150) to a control group (N=150).

 YLWH in the control arm will receive weekly static information-only emails, compared to daily use of the dynamic YT social network site for the intervention group.

 Participants will be recruited from six cities: Houston, Chicago, Atlanta, Tampa, Philadelphia, and the Bronx.

 Assessments will be collected at baseline, 5, 8, and 11-month follow-up.

 Specific Aims include: Primary Aim: In a 2-arm RCT (n=300), assess the efficacy of YouTHrive to suppress VL among YLWH at the 11-month follow-up time point compared to an HIV information-only control condition.

 H1: A higher proportion of participants in the YT intervention arm than in the information-only control arm will have undetectable VL at the 11-month follow-up time point.

 Secondary Aim: Assess whether YT is more beneficial for substance-using than non substance-using YLWH.

 H2: Among YLWH in the YT intervention arm, a higher proportion of substance-using YLWH will demonstrate VL suppression at the 11-month follow-up time point compared to non substance-using YLWH.

 Connecting Youth and Young Adults to Optimize ART Adherence: YouTHrive Efficacy Trial@highlight

YouTHrive (YT) is a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of an adapted version of the Thrive With Me (TWM) intervention for youth living with HIV (YLWH).

 In the RCT, intervention participants will have access to the full YouTHrive (YT) website- a mobile-enhanced private social networking website aimed at improving medication adherence for YLWH.

 The investigators will enroll up to 60 YLWH for formative work on YT, and 300 YLWH (15-24 years old) of all genders with a detectable viral load (VL) across six cities and randomize them to either the intervention condition or control condition.

 Assessments will be collected at baseline, 5, 8, and 11-month follow-up.
