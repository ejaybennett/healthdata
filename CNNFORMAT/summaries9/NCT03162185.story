(secondQuint)Serotonin and Motor Plasticity.

 Microdialysis findings in animal models provide evidence for a monoaminergic augmentation of motor function.

 However, this evidence is largely limited to noradrenaline and dopamine, with little evidence to support a similar effect for serotonin.

 What remains to be tested therefore, is whether acute serotonergic administration induces neural or behavioral changes during motor learning also.

 Using a sample of 60 female participants (with the possible inclusion of male participants at a later date), the investigators aim to test the effects of a serotonergic challenge on motor learning and plasticity in healthy participants.

With this study, the investigators aim to test whether acute administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) improves motor performance in a sequential motor learning task in comparison to placebo in healthy humans.
