(secondQuint)To Assess the Cutaneous Irritation and Sensitization Potential of a Cosmetic Facial Product Using a Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT) in Healthy Participants.

 The first phase of the study is an Induction Phase; a known amount of each product (test and control) is applied, under a semi-occlusive patch.

 Patches will remain on the skin for 48 (2) (weekdays) or 72 (2) (including inclusive weekends) hours during this phase.

 Induction phase lasts for 3 weeks.

 After the Induction Phase participants will enter a Rest Phase of 2 weeks duration, during which no patches are applied.

 After the Rest Phase, participants will return to the clinical site for the Challenge Phase.

 In this phase a challenge patch containing the test and control products is applied to virgin skin for 48 (2) hours then assessed 30 minutes (maximum 1 hour) following removal, 24 ( 2) and 48 (2) hours later.
