(firstQuint)Norepinephrine Infusion Different Doses in Cesarean Delivery.

 Maternal hypotension is a common complication after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery (CD).

 Using vasopressors have been considered a gold standard for prevention of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) during CD.

 Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor characterized by both adrenergic agonist activity in addition to a weak adrenergic agonist activity; thus, NE is considered a vasopressor with minimal cardiac depressant effect; these pharmacological properties would make NE an attractive alternative to phenylephrine and ephedrine (the most commonly used vasopressors in obstetric anesthesia).

 Norepinephrine has been recently introduced as a prophylactic vasopressor during CD with promising results; However, the optimum dose for efficient prophylaxis with the least side effects is not known.

 In this study, three doses (0.

1, 0.

15 mcg/Kg/min) of norepinephrine will be compared for prophylaxis against PSH during CD.
