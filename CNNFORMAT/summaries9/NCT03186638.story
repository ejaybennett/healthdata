(thirdQuint)Exercise and Low-Dose Ibuprofen for Cognitive Impairment in Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I.

 To provide preliminary data on the individual effects of exercise and ibuprofen, as well as the combined effect of both interventions, on alleviating chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to health education and placebo controls, as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACTCog).

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To provide preliminary data on the individual effects of exercise and ibuprofen , as well as the combined effect of both interventions, on alleviating CRCI in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to health education and placebo controls by objective assessments of cognitive function.

 II.

 To provide preliminary data on the individual effects of exercise and ibuprofen , as well as the combined effect of both interventions, on alleviating CRCI in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to health education and placebo controls on phone-based cognitive function measures (digit span, word recall, digits backward, CALVT, category fluency; all from BTACT).

 III.

 To provide preliminary data on the individual effects of exercise and ibuprofen, as well as the combined effect of both interventions, on serum pro-inflammatory (MCP-1, IL- 6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, sTNFR2, sTNFR1, IL-1beta) and anti-inflammatory (sIL-1Ra, IL-10) cytokines/receptors in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to health education and placebo controls.

 IV.

 To provide preliminary data on the mediating effects of cytokine concentrations on the CRCI changes due to exercise and ibuprofen (as well as the combined effect of both interventions), in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to health education and placebo controls on cytokines/receptors.

 OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

 ARM I: Patients receive ibuprofen orally (PO) twice a day (BID) for 6 weeks and participate in a discussion of "Chemotherapy and You" pamphlet.

 ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 weeks and participate in a discussion of "Chemotherapy and You" pamphlet.

 ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.

 Patients also participate in home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise over 20-60 minutes 3 to 5 times per week for 6 weeks.

 ARM IV: Patients receive ibuprofen PO BID for 6 weeks.

 Patients also participate in home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise over 20-60 minutes 3 to 5 times per week for 6 weeks.

 After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

 Exercise and Low-Dose Ibuprofen for Cognitive Impairment in Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy@highlight

This randomized phase II trial studies how well exercise and low-dose ibuprofen in improving cognitive impairment in patients with colorectal cancer that has not spread to other places in the body who are receiving chemotherapy.

 Anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen, may slow the decline of cognitive processes and diseases involving the brain.

 Exercise may also help alleviating cognitive difficulties during chemotherapy.
