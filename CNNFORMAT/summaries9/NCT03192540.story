(thirdQuint)The Impact of an 8-week Supported Exercise Program on Fitness and Symptoms in Adolescents With Down Syndrome.

 Adolescents with Down syndrome will attend an eight-week, center-based exercise intervention.

 Participants will undergo an hour of exercise intervention each week.

 During this time, participants will be working with a certified athletic trainer, exercise physiologist and physician.

 Exercises will focus on strength and endurance of all major muscle groups, while ensuring proper technique and form is used.

 They will also receive instruction on how to continue the exercise program at home.

 Prior to starting, and at the end of eight visits, all exercise participants will undergo testing procedures for anthropometric, strength and flexibility measurements.

 This data will be collected as part of clinically evaluating the impact of the program on each participant.

 In addition, to the exercise program (and clinical assessments of fitness), DSFit participants will complete study measures of behavioral functioning as well as scales of depression and anxiety.

 In addition, participants in the DSFit study will complete a weekly exercise log during and for three months after the intervention.
