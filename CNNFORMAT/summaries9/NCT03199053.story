(fifthQuint)Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Dapagliflozin and Saxagliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Aged 10 to Below 18 Years Old.

 In pediatric Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects on diet and exercise and metformin, or insulin, or metformin and insulin: The primary research hypothesis for dapagliflozin is whether addition of dapagliflozin, including up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as compared to placebo when each are administered over 26 weeks of oral double-blind add-on treatment.

 The primary research hypothesis for saxagliptin is whether addition of saxagliptin, including up-titration if needed, results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c as compared to placebo when each are administered over 26 weeks of oral double-blind add-on treatment.

 Study Design: The proposed study is a 26-week Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study with a 26-week safety extension period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg), and, separately, saxagliptin (2.

5 mg and 5 mg) in pediatric subjects with T2DM, and an additional post study visit at Week 104 for assessment of measures of growth and maturity.

 Approximately 243 pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.

5 mg, or placebo.

 Approximately 81 subjects will be randomized to each treatment arm.

 After a 26-week, double-blind, ST treatment period, the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed.

 This will be followed by a 26-week, site- and subject-blind LT safety extension period.

 Dapagliflozin and, separately, saxagliptin will be compared against the single shared placebo comparator.

 Measures of growth and maturity will be assessed at the Week 104 post study visit.

 Subjects will be required to have been treated with diet and exercise and a stable dose of at least 1000 mg metformin (IR or XR) for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable baseline dose of insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks, or a stable combination of at least 1000 mg metformin and insulin for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization.

 At least 50% of subjects will be on a stable baseline dose of metformin, with or without concurrent insulin therapy.

 At least 30% of total subjects will be between the ages of 10 and 14 years and at least one third, but no more than two thirds, female subjects.

 During the 2-week lead-in period, subjects will be instructed on a diet and exercise program (in accordance with the American Diabetes Association [ADA] or similar local guidelines) to be followed for the study duration.

 Subjects will maintain their baseline types and/or doses of antidiabetic therapy throughout the study (2-week lead-in, 26-week double-blind ST treatment period, and the 26-week blinded safety extension LT treatment period).

 If applicable, investigators will encourage subjects to keep their insulin doses stable.

 Down-titration of insulin will be allowed only as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia and will be at the discretion of the Investigator.

 Home glucose meters to monitor glucose control will be dispensed to subjects and self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) requirements and procedures will be explained.

 Subjects will also be instructed on the use of the subject diary to record self-monitored glucose levels and daily insulin dose, if applicable.

 Subjects will also receive a blood ketone meter for testing when DKA is suspected.

 After the lead-in period, eligible subjects with HbA1c of 6.

5% to 10.

5% at screening will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive oral, double-blind, dapagliflozin 5 mg (approximately 81 subjects), saxagliptin 2.

5 mg (approximately 81 subjects), or placebo (approximately 81 subjects).

 Randomization will be stratified based on baseline anti-diabetes treatment regimen (stable baseline dose of metformin (IR or XR), a stable baseline dose of insulin, or a stable combination of metformin and insulin), gender, and age (10 to below 15 years of age, 15 to below 18 years of age).

 A blinded HbA1c assessment will be performed at Week 12.

 All subjects with Week 12 HbA1c values = 7% will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 5 mg) or up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (dapagliflozin 10 mg) after the Week 12 assessment.

 Similarly, subjects assigned to the saxagliptin treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values >= 7% will be re randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low-dose treatment (saxagliptin 2.

5 mg) or up-titrate to the high-dose treatment (saxagliptin 5 mg) after the Week 12 assessment.

 Subjects assigned to the placebo treatment arm at Day 1 Randomization with Week 12 HbA1c values >= 7% will continue on placebo treatment.

 To maintain the blinding of treatments as well as HbA1c results, all placebo subjects and all subjects taking saxagliptin or dapagliflozin with an HbA1c = 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will get a weight of 0.

 The subjects who had HbA1c>= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose will have a weight of 2.

 The subjects who withdrew from the study entirely before the second randomization and all placebo subjects will get a weight of one.

 The intent-to-treat (ITT) estimand will be evaluated as the primary estimand.

 Missing values for Week 26 will be imputed using the multiple imputation method.

 The details of the imputation method will be presented in the statistical analysis plan.

 Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated based on maximum likelihood for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups.

 To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis for the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26, additional sensitivity analysis may be performed using the Evaluable Subjects Data Set if > 10% of the subjects in any treatment group in the Randomized Subjects Data Set have relevant protocol deviations.

 The primary endpoint will also be compared between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo.

 In addition, up titrating to high-dose and continuing on low-dose will be compared in the subset of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12.

 These analyses are described under secondary efficacy analyses.

 Secondary efficacy analyses will also be performed separately for each drug (saxagliptin and dapagliflozin).

 For each drug, the following sequential testing order will be employed to control multiplicity of testing for the secondary objectives.

 1.

 Comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo 2.

 Comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo 3.

 Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low dose/high-dose treatment regimen and placebo 4.

 Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between the low-dose treatment regimen and placebo 5.

 Comparison of mean reduction in FPG from baseline at Week 26 between overall drug treatment and placebo 6.

 Comparison of the percentage of subjects with baseline HbA1c>= 7% who achieve an HbA1c level = 7% who achieve an HbA1c level = 7% who achieve an HbA1c level = 7% who achieve an HbA1c level = 7% at Week 12 and continued on the low-dose will get a weight of 2.

 The subjects who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12 and received the high-dose will have a weight of 0.

 The subjects who withdrew from the study entirely before the second randomization and all placebo subjects will get a weight of one.

 For subjects on saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and who had HbA1c >= 7% at Week 12, the change from baseline HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared between the subjects re-randomized to remain on the low-dose and the subjects who are re-randomized to the high- dose using an ANCOVA.

 Change from baseline of HbA1c at Week 26 (ST) will be compared also using a repeated measures analysis between overall drug and placebo.

 For this analysis, both treatment regimens will be combined into one treatment group for each drug.

 Change from baseline at Week 26 (ST) in FPG will be analyzed similar to the primary weighted analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26.

 The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.

0% at Week 26 (ST) will be analyzed using weighted logistic regression with adjustment for the baseline HbA1c measurement and the randomization strata.

 Weighting for the subjects will be applied similarly to a weighting in the analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c.

 Subjects with missing a response at Week 26 will be imputed by dichotomizing the imputed values of HbA1c at Week 26.

 The assessment of safety will be based on the analyses of AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, hypoglycemia, DKA, safety laboratory evaluations, and measures of growth and maturity.

 All safety analyses will be performed using the Treated Subjects Data Set.

 Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin will be summarized separately.

 Treatment regimens (low-dose or low-dose/high-dose) will be combined for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin to provide the safety summary for overall saxagliptin and overall dapagliflozin compared to placebo.

 A common placebo group will be included in each summary.

 Measures of growth, bone and maturation markers will also be summarized for the combined ST + LT + additional post study visit at Week 104.

 Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Dapagliflozin and Saxagliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Aged 10 to Below 18 Years Old@highlight

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are aged 10 to below 18 years old and are currently taking metformin, insulin, or both drugs.

 Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are both approved for use in patients with Type 2 Diabetes aged 18 years or older.

 This study will assess how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin work by finding out how these treatments affect blood glucose (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a pill that contains no active drug), in children and adolescents.

 Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are considered investigational products in this study since while they have been approved for use in adults (patients 18 years or older), they haven't been approved for children and adolescents due to lack of clinical studies in this specific population.

 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who do not have this disease.

 The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term and long-term medical problems.

 The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood glucose to a normal level.

 Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the possibility of amputation.

 Dapagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels by helping the kidneys to remove excess glucose from the blood and excrete it in the urine.

 It prevents the kidneys from returning glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream.

 Saxagliptin increases insulin production when blood glucose levels are high.

 Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows the body to use sugar (glucose) from the food that is eaten for energy or to store glucose for future use.

 Saxagliptin helps to improve blood sugar levels in response to a meal and between meals if blood glucose levels are not lowered effectively.

 Saxagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low.

 Saxagliptin also helps to decrease the amount of sugar made by the body.

 Together, these processes reduce blood glucose levels and help to control Type 2 Diabetes.

 Dapagliflozin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) has been shown to be effective in lowering blood glucose in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and is available for use in adults (patients 18 years or older) in approximately 40 countries worldwide including the USA and Europe.

 Dapagliflozin has not yet been studied in children (pediatric patients).

 Saxagliptin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) has been shown to be effective in lowering blood glucose in adults with Type 2 Diabetes and is available for use in adults (patients 18 years or older) in approximately 90 countries worldwide.

 Saxagliptin also has not yet been studied in children (pediatric patients).

 The subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo (a pill that looks identical but contains inactive drug).

 This study will be double blind; this means that neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know which treatment the subject will receive.

 Which treatment the subject receives is decided by a computer, purely by chance; this is called a "random assignment".

 For this study, there will first be a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, followed by a 2 week lead in phase.

 Thereafter there will be a 26 week short-term treatment phase (week 1-week 26), and a 26 week long-term treatment phase (week 27-week 52).

 Following this there will be a follow-up telephone call on week 56 and a post study visit at week 104.

 At day 1 visit after the lead in phase the subject will be randomly assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 2.

5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner.

 This treatment will continue up to week 14.

 Then after week 14, and until the end of the study, the subject will be assigned to receive one of the following 5 treatments: dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, saxagliptin 2.

5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner.

 The drugs assigned after week 14 will be the same drugs as at Day 1, but some of the groups will receive them at a higher dose.

 After completion of the 26-week short-term phase, the subject will enter a 26 week long-term phase.

 The same treatment that the subject had been assigned to at week 14 visit will be continued.

 This long-term phase is primarily designed to provide additional information on how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are tolerated.

 Following the treatment phases, there will be a follow-up telephone call at week 56.

 The subject will be asked to visit the clinic at week 104 again for a final evaluation of the physical development (based on the stage of puberty).
