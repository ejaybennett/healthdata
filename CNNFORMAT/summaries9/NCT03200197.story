(thirdQuint)Effectiveness of Menthol Chewing Gum in the Management of Thirst.

 There is evidence that chewing gum is effective in relieving thirst in the surgical patient in the preoperative period as it stimulates the salivary glands by means of mechano and chemoreceptors, increasing the salivary pH and flow, lubricating the oral cavity, acting in this way on peripheral thirst, which is triggered by dehydration of the oral mucosa.

 Furthermore, menthol gum stimulates the cold receptors, known as TRPM8, which are responsible for deactivating centers of thirst.

 Thus, the risk of bronchoaspiration due to gastric fullness is avoided and the discomfort of a dry mouth is reduced.

Preliminary evidence indicates that the chewing gum strategy assists in the relief of a dry mouth and thirst in patients undergoing dialysis and head and neck radiotherapy.

 However, there is no scientific evidence of controlled studies with results that can be generalized regarding the use of chewing gum to reduce thirst and its discomforts in surgical patients in the preoperative period when they remain in a fasted state.

 Effectiveness of Menthol Chewing Gum in the Management of Thirst@highlight

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of menthol chewing gum compared to maintained fasting (usual care) in reducing the intensity of the surgical patient's thirst during the preoperative period.

 The hypothesis of the study was that the use of menthol chewing gum in surgical patients in the preoperative period would be more effective than the maintenance of fasting with regard to the decrease in thirst and its discomforts.
