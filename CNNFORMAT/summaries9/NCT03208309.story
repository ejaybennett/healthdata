Considering that, Diacerein is on the market for 16 years being used continuously in elderly patients with osteoarthritis without experience significant side effects, and considering the anti-hyperglycemic effect and the improvement in the insulin resistance observed in animal models of type 2 diabetes treated with this medicine.

 The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Diacerein, a medication with anti-osteoarthritic properties and moderately analgesic activity, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic, which demonstrates inhibit properties for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1).

 Administered for 12 weeks and the effect in the glycemic and metabolic control in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 and secondary failure to metformin treatment.
