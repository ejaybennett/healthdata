(fifthQuint)Staging Accuracy of a Selective Lymphadenectomy Strategy in Early Stage NSCLC.

 Background: Complete lung cancer lymphadenectomy in patients without nodal metastasis may not improve survival and would increase operative duration and cause damage to mediastinal structures.

The investigator's previous retrospective study showed tumors with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) or lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA) histology had zero mediastinal nodal involvement.

 Tumors in the apical segment of upper lobes had zero inferior mediastinal nodal involvement.

 The current prospective, multi-center, observational study is to verify the staging accuracy of a selective mediastinal lymphadenectomy strategy based on intraoperative histological subtyping by frozen section and tumor location in patients with clinical T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer.

 Objectives: Primary: To determine the staging concordance rate of the selective mediastinal lymphadenectomy strategy with the traditional complete lymphadenectomy strategy.

 Secondary: 1.

 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative histologic subtyping by frozen section.

 2.

 To determine the mediastinal lymph node metastasis rate in clinical T1N0M0 lung cancer with different histologic subtypes.

 3.

 To evaluate the pattern of mediastinal involvement of tumors in different lung segments.

 4.

 To determine the mediastinal nodal status of tumors with different radiological features (pure ground glass opacity, mixed ground glass opacity and solid nodules).

 Outlines: All recruited patients will undergo complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy.

 For tumors in the left lungs, removal of mediastinal nodal stations 5,6,7,8 and 9 are required.

 For tumors in the right lungs, removal of mediastinal nodal stations 2,4,7,8 and 9 are required.

 Frozen section histologic subtyping will be made intraoperatively.

 By the selective strategy, the patients with intraoperative AIS/MIA/LPA diagnosis will be considered as negative mediastinal metastasis and patients with an apical tumor will be considered as negative inferior mediastinal metastasis.

 Otherwise, the mediastinal nodal status will be determined by the post-operative pathology.

 The virtual staging results of this selective strategy will then be compared with the final staging results by the complete lymphadenectomy.

 Staging Accuracy of a Selective Lymphadenectomy Strategy in Early Stage NSCLC@highlight

Systemic mediastinal lymphadenectomy is deemed indispensable in lung cancer surgery for accurate staging and complete resection.

 However, extensive lymphadenectomy in patients without nodal metastasis may not improve survival and would increase operative duration and cause damage to mediastinal structures.

Therefore the precise selection of patients without mediastinal nodal metastasis is the key to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy.

The investigator's previous retrospective study shows tumor location and histological subtypes are exclusive predictors of negative mediastinal nodal disease.

 The current prospective observational study is to further verify the staging accuracy of this selective mediastinal lymphadenectomy strategy.
