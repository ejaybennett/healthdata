(fifthQuint)Scleral Self-indentation Chandelier-assisted Peripheral Vitrectomy Under Air Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.

.

 Retrospective cohort study.

 One hundred and thirty eyes of 130 participants with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were identified.

 All the participants had undergone a chandelier-assisted peripheral vitrectomy under air.

 Scleral self-indentation had been used in 68 eyes (study group) (Indentation group), while non-indentation had been used in 62 eyes (comparison group) (Non-indentation group).

 Outcome variables included: Trimming-induced retinal breaks (TIRB), retinal redetachment rate, final LogMAR BCVA, and intraoperative complications.

 Scleral Self-indentation Chandelier-assisted Peripheral Vitrectomy Under Air Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.

@highlight

The investigators compared the incidence of trimming-induced retinal breaks, retinal redetachment rate, and final LogMAR BCVA; between scleral self-indentation and non-indentation during chandelier-assisted peripheral vitrectomy under air for eyes with primary retinal detachment.

 Self-indentation enables complete trimming of the vitreous base without causing iatrogenic retinal breaks, with a higher retinal reattachment rate, and with less need for chandelier shift than with non-indentation approach.
