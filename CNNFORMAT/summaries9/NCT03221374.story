(fifthQuint)Mind-body Awareness Training and Brain-computer Interface.

 In this protocol, the following hypothesis will be tested; namely that MBAT including the verified mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course will improve the ability for subjects to concentrate on the control of the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.

 Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training.

 The performance of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.

 Procedures involved include a standard 8-week MBSR course, and an EEG brain noninvasive brain computer interface study.

 Mind-body Awareness Training and Brain-computer Interface@highlight

Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices, has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners.

 In the present study, the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the initial learning of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is being investigated.

 The hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.
