(fifthQuint)A Phase III Study of Fruquintinib in Combination With Paclitaxel in Second Line Gastric Cancer(FRUTIGA).

 This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed after first-line standard chemotherapy.

 After checking eligbility criteria, subjects will be randomized into Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel group (treatment group) or placebo combined with Paclitaxel group (control group) in a ration of 1:1.

 Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS).

 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.

1), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), .

 Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.
