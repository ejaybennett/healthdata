 A total of 110 newly type 2 diabetic diagnosed patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c%) above 9% were hospitalized, and were randomly divided into two groups: NovoRapid group (group Asp) and Prandilin group (group Lis) in CSII, combined with metformin therapy.

 Treatments were maintained for 2-3 weeks after the glycaemic target was reached.

 To complete the assessment of general information, fasting C-peptide (C-P0), 2-h postprandial C-peptide (C-P2h), fasting insulin (Ins0), 2-h postprandial insulin (Ins2h), HbA1c% and fructosamine on the baseline and endpoint.
