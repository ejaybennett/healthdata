(thirdQuint)Crossover Blinded Trial of Cell Therapy Versus Placebo in COPD.

 The purpose of the Lung Institute is to collect, minimally process, and administer a person's own stem cells and/or platelet rich plasma and deliver the product back to the patient same-day through an intravenous catheter.

 This study is limited to patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a double-blinded prospective, cohort trial using cross-over methodology.

 The aim of this study is to determine if stem cell therapy is better than placebo among a group of patients with COPD.

 50 participants will be recruited for each arm of the study.

 Cohort A will receive three days of cell therapy using the venous procedure (three consecutive days of blood harvest, cell separation and cell application).

 Cohort A will return in three months and receive three consecutive days of placebo.

 Cohort B will receive three consecutive days of placebo.

 Cohort B will return in three months and receive three consecutive days of cell therapy using the venous procedure.
