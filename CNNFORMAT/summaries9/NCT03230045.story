(secondQuint)Dual Acupoints Stimulation Alleviates Pulmonary Complication.

 Postoperative pulmonary complications contributes to the high morbidity of aged patients.

 The incidence could be as high as 30~50% in those undergoing abdominal surgery.

 Stimulation at acupoints have been to alleviate inflammatory response,improve pain management and decrease consumption of opioids, indicating a beneficial effect on pulmonary complications.

 In this study the investigators tend to verify the effect of dual acupoints stimulation on pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery in aged patients.
