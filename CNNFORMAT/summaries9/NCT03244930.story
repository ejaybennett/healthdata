(secondQuint)Low Dose Plerixafor Plus G-CSF in Mobilizing Stem Cells for Autologous Peripheral Blood Transplantation.

 Plerixafor, is added to mobilizing chemotherapy and G-CSF to overcome poor stem cell mobilization.

 Consecutive patients in autologous transplant protocol will receive mobilization consisted of daily subcutaneously G-CSF 10 mg/kg for 4 days and plerixafor 0.

12 mg/kg as a single dose 11 hours prior to initiation of apheresis.

 HSC collection was performed with a Cobe Spectra(R) or Spectra Optia(R) apheresis system.

 The planned target blood volume to be processed will be 4-fold total blood volume calculated according to patients' weight and size.

 Peripheral blood CD34+ counts will be analyzed using flow cytometry.

 For each ASCT, we aimed for target yields of at least 2 x 106 CD34+cells/kg.

 Toxicities and engraftment will be documented.

 Low Dose Plerixafor Plus G-CSF in Mobilizing Stem Cells for Autologous Peripheral Blood Transplantation@highlight

Plerixafor, is added to mobilizing chemotherapy and G-CSF to overcome poor stem cell mobilization.

 We want to demonstrate that half of the commonly prescribed dose can be safely administered once as a single dose in first attempt leading to apheresis yields of >2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight.
