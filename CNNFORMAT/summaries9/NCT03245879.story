(fifthQuint)Antibiotic Stewardship in Small Hospitals.

 The investigators designed a clustered randomized controlled intervention to evaluate 3 antibiotic stewardship strategies designed for small hospitals.

 Each hospital was randomized to one of three ASP interventions with increasing levels of intensity and intervention (Programs 1, 2, 3).

 The investigators felt that clinical equipoise about the effect of ASPs did not exist and randomizing to a no-intervention group was unacceptable.

 Antibiotic use was compared within each group before and after the intervention.

 In keeping with other real-world implementation studies, secondary analyses were planned to include an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of each strategy.

 Randomization of hospitals was stratified based on patient volume.

 Hospital administration and clinical leadership were not blinded to which ASP program they were randomly assigned to, but there were no public announcements.

 The intervention started March 2014 and ended June 2015.

 Antibiotic Stewardship in Small Hospitals@highlight

Core elements of effective antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) have been identified and evidence-based guidelines have been developed for implementation.

 The majority of the evidence used for these guidelines are from published studies on the effectiveness of ASPs in large academic or large community hospitals.

 A significant portion of healthcare in the United States, however, takes place in small hospitals.

 In 2015, 73% of US hospitals had < 200 beds (4,057 hospitals) and accounted for 29% of all US inpatient bed days.

 Limited studies on the effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship implementation have been performed in hospitals with < 200 beds.

 Antibiotic use rates and selection patterns in these small hospitals are similar to that of large hospitals and the majority of small hospitals lack formal ASP that meet the CDC's core elements.

 The objective of this real-world implementation study was to assess the effectiveness of three ASP strategies of escalating intensity designed specifically for small hospitals within a vertically integrated healthcare delivery system.
