(fifthQuint)Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain (Neuroimaging Supplement).

 This neuroimaging sub-study will examine a sub-set (N=60) of the main study's (Smoking Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain) randomized clinical trial participants (balanced sample between BAS+ and SC).

 Participants who meet MRI eligibility and elect to participate in the sub-study will complete two, 1-hour functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while completing computer tasks inside an MRI scanner.

 fMRI can identify mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report and behavioral measures.

 The investigators will examine neural responses in three parallel pathways including: cognitive control, food cue reactivity, and food reinforcement.

 The project's three aims address: 1) identifying putative brain mechanisms underlying BAS+ (vs.

 SC) treatment for smoking cessation and PCWG; 2) evaluating the relative contribution of treatment-induced changes in task related brain signal (Food Cue Response, Food Reinforcement/Choice) in prediction of post treatment food intake; and 3) testing whether BAS+ (vs.

 SC) induced change in neural responses to food cues and food reinforcement is a stronger predictor of food intake among smokers with greater cognitive control.

 The findings will address why BAS+ may be effective in managing PCWG and provide insight into which patients are best supported by this treatment.

 The investigators will also test whether cognitive control processes moderate the influence of BAS+ treatment on food intake.

 Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain (Neuroimaging Supplement)@highlight

This research study is a sub-study within the Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain main study (NCT02906787).

 Participants who are eligible for the main study and meet certain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) related study criteria (i.

e.

 conditions) may also elect to complete a series of computer tasks inside a standard, closed MRI scanner to examine changes in brain activity associated with the smoking cessation counseling that participants will receive in the main study.

 In total, participants will be asked to complete 2, one-hour fMRI scans: 1 before completing their first counseling session and 1 during the final 7 days of the scheduled 8-week nicotine patch treatment period.
