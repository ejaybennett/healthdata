 Sarcoma Treatment Guide in Improving Self-Monitoring in Patients With Sarcoma Receiving Chemotherapy@highlight

This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well the Sarcoma Treatment Guide works in improving self-monitoring in patients with sarcoma who are receiving chemotherapy.

 The Sarcoma Treatment Guide may help patients with sarcoma to be better informed, become more engaged with care, encourage communication, and to better manage side effects associated with chemotherapy treatments in order to improve quality of life.
