(thirdQuint)Multi-CAR T Cell Therapy in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells, which remains a clinical challenge despite advanced therapeutic interventions including novel molecular therapies and stem cell transplantation (SCT).

 This trial is to test the safety and efficacy of T cells genetically modified to specifically target several MM surface antigens, including BCMA, CD38, CD56, CD138 or alternative MM surface antigens, based on a multi-CAR T cell immunotherapy approach.

 Another goal of the study is to investigate the persistence and function of CAR T cells in the body after CAR T cell infusion.

The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of autologous CAR T cell immunotherapy targeting multiple cancer cell surface antigens in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients.

 Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence and function of CAR T cells in the body.
