(fifthQuint)Effects of Apalutamide Plus LHRH Agonist or Apalutamide Plus Abiraterone Acetate Plus LHRH Agonist for Six Months for Prostate Cancer Patients at High Risk for Recurrence.

 Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

 This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

 You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group: - If you are assigned to Group A, you will receive an LHRH agonist and apalutamide.

 - If you are assigned to Group B, you will receive an LHRH agonist, apalutamide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone.

 Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days.

 You will take 4 apalutamide tablets by mouth 1 time each day with or without food.

 The type of LHRH agonist you receive will depend on what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest and may be either leuprolide, goserelin, or triptorelin.

 These drugs are given as injections, but the schedule for each is different.

 The study doctor will explain how and when the drug is given, as well as its risks.

 If you are in Group B, you will take 1 prednisone tablet by mouth 1 time each day.

 It is recommended that prednisone be taken with food, but this is not required.

 If you are in Group B, you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth 1 time each day on an empty stomach (no food for at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after each dose).

 Do not crush or chew the tablets.

 You may take your tablets at the same time, if needed.

 Length of Treatment: You may take the study drugs for up to 6 cycles.

 You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

 All participants on this study will be scheduled to have surgery.

 You will receive a separate consent form that details the surgical procedure in more detail.

 Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit after surgery (described below).

 Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

 This blood will also be used to check your prostate specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels.

 You must fast for up to 12 hours before this blood draw.

 - Urine will be collected for routine tests.

 On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 5, and 6: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

 This blood will also be used to check your PSA level.

 You must fast for up to 12 hours before this blood draw.

 On Day 15 of Cycle 1, 2, and 3, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

 On Day 1 of Cycle 4: Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

 You must fast for up to 12 hours before this blood draw.

 After you stop taking the study drugs (End-of-Treatment Visit): - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to test your PSA level.

 You must fast for up to 12 hours before this blood draw.

 - Urine will be collected for routine tests.

 - You will have a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 For the purposes of this study, tissue samples that are removed on the day of surgery will be collected for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers).

 About 4 Weeks after surgery: - You will have a physical exam.

 - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to test your PSA level.

 You must fast for up to 12 hours before this blood draw.

 hours before blood draw.

 - You will have a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

 - You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

 Effects of Apalutamide Plus LHRH Agonist or Apalutamide Plus Abiraterone Acetate Plus LHRH Agonist for Six Months for Prostate Cancer Patients at High Risk for Recurrence@highlight

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding abiraterone acetate and standard of care prednisone to the combination of apalutamide and a standard type of drug called an LHRH agonist can help to control prostate cancer when given before surgery.

 The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.

 This is an investigational study.

 Apalutamide is not FDA approved or commercially available.

 It is currently being used for research purposes only.

 The combination of abiraterone acetate, LHRH agonists, and prednisone is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

 Both drug combinations being used in this study are considered investigational.

 Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this study.

 All will take part at MD Anderson.
