(firstQuint)Transverse Facial Cleft Repair Using Precise Location of Commissure.

 Nine patients with transverse facial cleft were treated with redesigned repair using precise location of commissure.

 The main outcome measurement included scar, symmetry of the commissure.

 They were graded in five scores by five resident physicians who had never seen the patients.

 The results were compared with nine patients treated with classical transverse facial cleft repair, and eight patients seen in our clinic other than transverse facial cleft.
