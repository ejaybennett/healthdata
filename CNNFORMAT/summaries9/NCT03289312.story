(firstQuint)Dissecting How Peripheral Lymphocytes Are Lost During Sepsis.

 There is an observational, clinical study.

 We recruit patients with diagnosis of new onset sepsis within 24h, collect and record clinical characteristics: Demography data,diagnosis, admission source, infection source, APACHE II,SOFA scores;Endotoxin levels and PaO2 measured; cent Immune and systemic inflammatory indicators:T, RR, WBC, ALC, etc.

;Complicated organs dysfunctions: duration and therapy;Incidence of ICU-acquired infection and prognosis.

The blood samples were collected for apoptosis,necrosis,autophagy,pyroptosis measurements.

The aim of this study is to investigate how peripheal lymphocyte loss relates to outcome and the mechanisms of peripheal lymphocyte loss in different condition.
