(fifthQuint)Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab(Pbr)/Nab-Paclitaxel Followed by Pbr/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide in TNBC.

 This is a multicenter, phase II, one-arm, open-label neoadjuvant study of pembrolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel followed by pembrolizumab in combination with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (E/C) in patients with TNBC.

 Pathological complete response rate at the time of surgery is the primary objective of this study.

 In approximately six large breast cancer centers in Germany 50 patients are planned to be enrolled.

 All patients will undergo state of the art staging and tumor assessments prior to study entry to assess eligibility for the present trial.

 Eligible and consented patients will receive 12 cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel i.

v.

 125 mg/m BSA q1w in combination with 4 cycles of pembrolizumab i.

v.

 200 mg q3w; followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin i.

v.

 90 mg/m BSA and cyclophosphamide i.

v.

 600 mg/m BSA, q3w in combination with 4 cycles pembrolizumab i.

v.

 200 mg q3w.

 Clinical and bioptic tumor assessment will be performed after each treatment phase.

 Additional imaging, preferably with sonography, will be performed 6 weeks after initiation of taxane and anthracycline therapy to allow for early progress and response monitoring.

 Study treatment will be applied until state of the art surgery, onset of unacceptable toxicities, progression or withdrawal of consent.

 No follow-up is planned after definite surgery.

 Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab(Pbr)/Nab-Paclitaxel Followed by Pbr/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide in TNBC@highlight

Despite its aggressiveness and high incidence, to date, no targeted therapies exist for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

 Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role of tumor immunology on outcome for this entity.

 Checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, which target immune cells within the tumor, might therefore have an important impact on therapy response and outcome in these high risk patients.

 We propose a phase II study exploring pathological complete response and the safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as well as the combination of pembrolizumab with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting for women with early TNBC.

 After completion of this study an extension will be determined.
