(thirdQuint)Retrieval of Sperm From Men With Azoospermia Using Ultrasound-guided Rete Testis Aspiration.

 The aim of this study is to demonstrate that ultrasound-guided rete testis aspiration is a safe and effective method to flush and aspirate rare sperm from the testes of men with azoospermia (no sperm in the ejaculate).

 Current methods to recover sperm from men with azoospermia range from surgically invasive and time consuming micro testicular sperm extraction (microTESE) to fine needle aspiration (FNA), which is less invasive and less time consuming, but also less effective because it is a blind approach.

 Our approach is not surgical; it involves the percutaneous insertion of a hypodermic needle into the rete testis space.

 This approach is also not blind because the needle is accurately positioned under ultrasound guidance into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules (where sperm are made).

 Patients who are scheduled to undergo testicular sperm extraction (TESE) will be approached about the experimental procedure.

 The investigators will first perform the experimental ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration on both testis and then perform the standard TESE procedure for sperm retrieval also on both testes.

 For the ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration, the investigators will flush and aspirate the tubules with 500ul of physiological saline, containing methylene blue and Optison ultrasound contrast agent in sterile 0.

9% saline (both routinely used in clinics).

 The investigators will examine the aspirate for presence of sperm.

 After the flushing/aspiration procedure, the investigators will perform the standard of care TESE procedure on both testicles.

 With this experimental design, the investigators can compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided aspiration technique to the effectiveness of the standard TESE procedure employed at the male fertility clinic at Magee-Womens Hospital.

 The ultrasound-guided rete testis approach will not interfere with the TESE approach, as the ultrasound-guided procedure accesses the tubules in the middle of the testis, but TESE accesses the tubules on the surface of the testis.

 The investigators hypothesize that sperm recovery using the ultrasound-guided rete testis injection/aspiration approach will at least as effective as TESE approach employed in the Magee male fertility clinic (10%) and it will be less invasive.

 Retrieval of Sperm From Men With Azoospermia Using Ultrasound-guided Rete Testis Aspiration@highlight

The objective of this study is to use ultrasound-guided rete testis flushing and aspiration technique to retrieve sperm, non-surgically, from the testes of azoospermic men.

 If sperm are retrieved by this method, it will provide a direct benefit to the infertile men.

 This protocol will also establish the safety and feasibility of the ultrasound-guided rete testis injection approach in consenting men before the approach is translated to teenage boys.
