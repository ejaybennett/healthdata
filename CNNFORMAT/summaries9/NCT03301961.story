(secondQuint)Multiplex Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA.

 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes about 85% of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

Early diagnosis and monitoring tumor recurrence after surgery are still far from satisfying.

 Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) detection has been proved to be feasible in early stage NSCLC in previous studies.

Both genomic mutation and methylation a promising biomarker.

Therefore,this study will perform multiplex detection of ctDNA,analysing mutations, methylation and other biomarkers,focusing on the early diagnosis and postoperative surveillance for NSCLC patients.
