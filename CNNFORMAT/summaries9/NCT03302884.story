(firstQuint)Circulating Tumor DNA as an Early Marker of Recurrence and Treatment Efficacy in Ovarian Carcinoma.

 The main objective is to explore the capacity of ctDNA to be an early marker of ovarian carcinoma recurrence after front-line treatments, i.

e.

 to show significant modifications before clinical diagnosis of disease relapse.

 Prospective multicentre open-label study During visits in the frame of management of the disease, blood samples will be collected at diagnosis, after each cycle of eventual neoadjuvant chemotherapy, every 6 months during the following 2 years, and every year during the remainin time of follow-up.

 Tumor samples will be collected at surgery or through a biopsy.

 Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years.
