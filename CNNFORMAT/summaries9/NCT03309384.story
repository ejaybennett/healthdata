(secondQuint)Intraoperative Monitoring to Predict Postoperative Complications After Thyroidectomy.

 Intraoperative PTH values and intraoperative continuous neuromonitoring will be collected prospectively in consecutive patients who undergo total thyroidectomy.

 Postoperative parathyroid morbidity and recurrent laryngeal nerve morbidity will be evaluated within 1 week after total thyroidectomy and at 1 year postoperatively.

 Other postoperative morbidity will be evaluated at 1 year postoperatively using validated classification.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of intraoperative continous and intermittent neuromonitoring and intraoperative parathormone (PTH) to predict postoperative nerve morbidity and hypocalcemia.
