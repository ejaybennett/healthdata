(thirdQuint)Remote Ischemic Conditioning Using the autoRIC.

 This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled single-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the autoRIC device to attenuate myocardial injury as measured by cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) levels in patients undergoing elective PCI.

 Eligible patients that are scheduled for an elective PCI or patients scheduled for a diagnostic catheterization procedure with orders of "treat as indicated" will be enrolled in the study.

 Patients will undergo remote ischemic conditioning with the autoRIC device or the control procedure with the autoRIC Sham device completed 1 hour prior to balloon or stent inflation.

 Subjects will have measurements of cTnI levels at baseline and 4-8 and 12-24 hours post completion of the PCI procedure.

 Adverse events will be recorded through study exit for all patients.

 Patients will be exited from the study after completion of their 30-day post-procedure telephone follow-up.

 Remote Ischemic Conditioning Using the autoRIC@highlight

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the hypothesis that patients receiving remote ischemic conditioning using the autoRIC device show statistically significant reduction in the prevalence of ischemia-reperfusion injury to the myocardium as compared to patients in the autoRIC Sham device arm (within 12-24 hours post-elective PCI procedure).
