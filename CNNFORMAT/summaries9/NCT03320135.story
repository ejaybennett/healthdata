(firstQuint)EMD for Treatment of Proximal Class-II Furcation Involvements.

 Proximal class-II furcation represents a challeng to periodontal therapy.

 Studies show that the ultrasonic non-surgical therapy doesn't work in these defects and the guided tissue regeneration therapy with membranes also demonstrates an unpredictable improvement.

 Therefore, enamel matrix derivative proteins (EMD) have been proposed as a periodontal regenerative procedure due to their fundamental role in cementum development.
