(secondQuint)PENS or TENS for Pain in Pancreatic Cancer.

 PENS and TENS have been reported with analgesic effect in patients with pain, including cancer pain, lower back pain, neck pain, stomachache and so on.

 Effect and mechanism of PENS on pain relieving has been widely researched.

 With additional electrical stimulation in certain frequency and intensity to conventional acupuncture, pain controlling effect has been largely enhanced.

 However, invasive operation limits its application and acceptability, especially on pancreatic cancer.

 TENS is an advanced technique generated from PENS, which is much more welcome for its noninvasive character.

 Further more, its analgesic effect on cancer pain has been proved by several multi-central, randomized, clinical trials.
