(fifthQuint)Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites.

 Many studies have addressed the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in free flap donor sites with mixed results.

 It is well established that NPWT is safe and causes no harm, and no delay in healing.

 A previous study performed at UAB showed that NPWT in complex Head & Neck Surgery reconstruction is safe, including free flap donor sites.

 There have been studies that state the rate of tendon exposure is lower with NPWT in free flap donor sites, and studies that conclude there is no difference in complication rates.

 Current clinical practice is varied, often within a single institution.

 While no studies of NPWT in free flap donor sites have noted inferior results with its use, a primary reason cited for not using it is cost.

 Traditional NPWT using canister-based vacuum devices adds significant cost.

 The PICO single-use NPWT device (Smith & Nephew) is a relatively inexpensive, low-profile dressing that does not require attachment to an external canister.

 It is battery-powered and disposable.

 Empiric use on our patients undergoing split-thickness skin-grafting to free flap donor sites shows good results with minimal intra-operative effort compared to traditional bandaging.

 We would like to prospectively investigate the use of this low-cost NPWT device and compare it directly to the traditional post-op dressing method.

 Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites@highlight

Various management options for free flap donor sites that require split thickness skin grafting exist.

 None has proven superior from both a patient care and a cost standpoint.

 Major complications occurring at these surgical sites include wound breakdown, tendon exposure, and loss of function.

 We seek to investigate the use of the PICO single-use negative pressure wound therapy device in these surgical sites and determine if it can yield superior results to simpler methods.
