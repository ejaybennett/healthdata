(fifthQuint)The Role of DNA Damage of Granulosa Cell on Oocyte Quality and in Vitro Fertilization Outcome.

 Granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes will be mechanically obtained during the oocyte pick-up procedure in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment due to unexplained infertility.

 Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in these cells will be evaluated by comet assay.

 The quality of oocytes retrieved during the oocyte pick-up procedure will be graded by particular criteria (zona pellucida thickness, granulation, vacuolization, etc).

 Fertilization rates, embryo quality by grading, and transfer rates will also be assessed.

 Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates, and pregnancy outcomes including gestational age at delivery, route of delivery, and birthweight will be recorded as well as demographic data such as age, body-mass index, smoking, alcohol use, employment, coexisting chronic disease, infertility duration, etiology of infertility, treatment protocol, and hormone levels on day 3.

 Implantation will be evaluated by determination of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at day 12 following an embryo transfer.

 Clinical pregnancy will be diagnosed upon presence of gestational sac on ultrasound examination.

 DNA damage of granulosa cells will be compared between unexplained infertile group and control group.

 The effect of DNA damage of granulosa cells on fertilization, quality of oocyte and embryo, implantation, and clinical pregnancy will be also evaluated.

 The Role of DNA Damage of Granulosa Cell on Oocyte Quality and in Vitro Fertilization Outcome@highlight

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage of granulosa cells obtained during oocyte retrieval will be evaluated by comet assay in unexplained infertile patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.

 The oocytes will be graded by particular criteria.

 Fertilization, embryo quality, transfer rate, implantation, clinical pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at delivery, route of delivery, and birthweight etc.

) will be recorded as well as demographic data.

 DNA damage of granulosa cells will be compared between unexplained infertile and control groups.

 The effect of DNA damage of granulosa cells on fertilization, quality of oocyte and embryo, implantation, and clinical pregnancy will be also evaluated.
