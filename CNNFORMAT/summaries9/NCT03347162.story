(fifthQuint)Muscle Dysfunction in Gastrointestinal or Hepatobiliary Cancer.

 RATIONAL: Patients diagnosed with GI-HEP cancer are faced with poor prognosis.

 The treatment is demanding and associated with severe deconditioning potentially leading to worse prognostic outcomes.

 To what extend patients body composition at the point of diagnoses, as well as changes in body composition throughout the cancer continuum is associated with cancer outcomes is currently not well-described, specifically if this should be part of standard clinical evaluation in order to optimize therapy-efficacy.

 Recent findings suggest that pathophysiological alterations in skeletal muscle mass and function can have significant implications for the risk of disease progression and long-term prognosis.

 Muscle Dysfunction in Gastrointestinal or Hepatobiliary Cancer@highlight

PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic properties of a comprehensive evaluation of body composition and physical function in patients with GI-HEP cancer from point of diagnosis and throughout the treatment trajectory.

 GI-HEP: Patients with tumors of the upper gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract, specifically tumors of the esophagus, gastro-esophageal junction, stomach, primary tumors of the liver or biliary tract, as well as colorectal liver metastasis or tumors of the pancreas.
