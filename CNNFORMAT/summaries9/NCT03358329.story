(firstQuint)Safety Evaluation of Repeat Placement of the S8 Sinus Implant in Chronic Sinusitis Patients With Nasal Polyps (ENCORE).

 The ENCORE Study is a prospective non-randomized, open-label, multicenter trial conducted in up to 10 clinical centers (academic and private) across the United States in 50 adults with chronic sinusitis, who are indicated for revision surgery because of recurring nasal obstruction/congestion symptoms and bilateral ethmoid polyposis.

 This study will assess the safety of repeat placement of the S8 Sinus Implant when used in chronic sinusitis (CS) patients with recurrent nasal polyps.
