(fifthQuint)To Compare the Efficacy of the Addition of Methotrexate (MTX) to Current Standard Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) First-line Treatment With Corticosteroids.

 This is a phase III randomized, multicenter, double blinded controlled study.

 Patients who develop clinically meaningful acute GVHD and who meet all other entry criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive either corticosteroids and placebo ("standard of care", control arm) or the combination of low-dose MTX with corticosteroids as first-line therapy for acute GVHD (MTX; "experimental arm").

 The primary analysis of this hypothesis generation study is to estimate the composite endpoint of GVHD-free and corticosteroids-free survival at 12 months after randomization in both treatment arms.

 In fact, it is more and more established that such composite endpoint is a clinically very relevant one because it represents ideal recovery from allo-SCT (Stem Cell transplantation) (at 1 year after acute GVHD diagnosis) and a measure of cure without ongoing morbidity.

 To Compare the Efficacy of the Addition of Methotrexate (MTX) to Current Standard Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) First-line Treatment With Corticosteroids@highlight

Phase III randomized double-blinded trial designed to compare the efficacy of the addition of MTX to current standard acute GVHD first-line treatment with corticosteroids.

 The protocol will use a novel endpoint for benchmarking interventions based on a composite primary endpoint of GVHD-free and corticosteroids-free survival.

 The primary endpoint of the trial will be the assessment of a composite endpoint of graft-versus-host disease-free and corticosteroids-free survival at 12 months after randomization
