(secondQuint)Powertoothbrushing for Treating Gingivitis.

 In this single-masked, parallel-armed, interventional clinical trial for treatment of gingivitis we will assess the use of an oscillating-rotating powered toothbrush in comparison to the use of a manual toothbrush over 12 weeks in the absence of interproximal hygiene.

 The primary outcome variable is the change from baseline in the Modified Gingival Index at 2, 4 and 12 weeks from Baseline.

 Secondary outcome variables include change from baseline in bleeding on probing as well as change from baseline in the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque index measuring overnight plaque formation.

 There will also be an assessment of single use efficacy in reduction of overnight plaque levels at the baseline visit.
