(fifthQuint)Semilunar and Conventional Coronally Positioned Flap for the Treatment Gingival Recession.

 The aim of this study is to clinically compare between the semilunar coronally positioned flap (SCPF) and the conventional coronally advanced flap (CAF) after applying modification in both techniques to treat class I Miller gingival recession.

 Coronally repositioned gingival margin will be stabilized by coronally anchored suture with composite stops on the buccal surface of tooth using flowable composite for the treatment of gingival recession.

 Ten patients who have bilateral maxillary buccal Miller Class I gingival recession defects will be enrolled in this study.

 These defects will be distributed randomly into two groups: the test group (SCPF) and control group (CAF).

 Clinical parameters will be evaluated: visible plaque index (VPI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession height (GRH), gingival recession width (GRW), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (WKT), thickness of keratinized tissue (TKT), change in the position of muco-gingival junction, vestibular depth, wound healing index (WHI), the percentage of root coverage (RC) and root coverage esthetic score (RES) system.

 A questionnaire will be given to each patient, which includes evaluation of the pain intensity, root sensitivity, and satisfaction with aesthetic by using the visual analog scale (VAS) and questions about the number of analgesic pills consumed per day.

 Semilunar and Conventional Coronally Positioned Flap for the Treatment Gingival Recession@highlight

A clinical evaluation of using the semilunar coronally position flap (SCPF) compared to the conventional coronally advanced flap (CAF) with modification to treat class I Miller gingival recession.

 The coronally repositioned gingival margin will be stabilized by coronally anchored suture with composite stops on the buccal surface of the tooth using flowable composite.

 The sample size will be ten patients.

 Each patient has bilateral Miller Class I gingival recessions; one will be treated with SCPF, while the other will be treated with CAF
