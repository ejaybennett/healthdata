(fifthQuint)Combination of Immunization and Radiotherapy for Recurrent GBM (InSituVac1).

 GBM is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis.

 The current strategy for newly diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

 After recurrence, there is no standard therapy and survival is less than 9 months.

 Recently, personalized cancer immunotherapy has shown great promise in treating different types of cancers.

 However, effective immunotherapies for recurrent GBM have yet to be established.

 Newly diagnosed GBM patients experience recurrence in five or seven months after standard treatment.

 We will investigate whether combining radiotherapy with intratumoral and systemic administration of immune adjuvants will improve the treatment outcome of recurrent GBM.

 We will use several immune adjuvants that activate innate and adaptive immunity.

The study will investigate combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy on recurrent glioblastoma(GBM).

 Immune adjuvants will be injected intratumorally and systemically to induce antitumor-specific immunity after radiation induced immunological tumor cell death (ICD).

 With radiation, tumor cells release tumor antigens that are captured by antigen presenting dendritic cells.

 Immune adjuvants promote the presentation of tumor antigens and the priming of antitumor T lymphocytes.

 The combined treatment induces and amplifies the specific antitumor immunity in recurrent GBM patients, prolonging survivals for GBM patients.
