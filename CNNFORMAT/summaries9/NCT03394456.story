(thirdQuint)Technology to Improve the Health of Resource-poor Hispanics With Diabetes.

 The number of Hispanics diagnosed with diabetes is escalating in the US with disproportionately higher prevalence and complication rates than other ethnicities.

 Community Health Workers (CHWs) are a well-established and culturally sensitive means to bridge gaps in care to individuals with diabetes.

 However CHWs are often left unsupported, placing patients at risk of substandard care or harm.

 Telemedicine is a term used to describe a range of technologies to support healthcare delivery via communication with the patient or a member of the healthcare delivery team.

 Though telemedicine has been implemented into diabetes programs for many years, there is a paucity of data showing the use of telemedicine for CHW training and support.

 In a pilot study, the investigators initiated a CHW-led diabetes program for resource-poor Hispanics with in-person support for CHWs.

 The current study utilizes pilot data to evaluate the use of telemedicine support for CHWs who lead diabetes programs for resource-poor Hispanics.

 Specifically, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in 4 cohort waves with 176 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

 The study will compare clinical outcomes and treatment satisfaction of subjects who receive a CHW-led diabetes group visit program incorporating telemedicine support (intervention, n=88) to subjects who receive usual care (wait list control, n=88).

 In addition, we will analyze the acceptability of telemedicine use for CHWs.

This study evaluates the effect of diabetes group visits that are led by Community Health Workers (CHWs).

 Half of the subjects will be randomized to receive a 6-month, CHW-led group visit program (intervention) and the other half will be randomized to receive 6-months of treatment as usual in the clinic followed by the group visit program (wait list control).

 The CHWs will receive training and support via telemedicine.
