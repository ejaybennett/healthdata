(thirdQuint)Comparison of the Proximal Approach and Distal Approach of Axillary Vein Catheterization Under Ultrasound Guidance.

 In this randomized single-centre study, all patients requiring axillary vein catheterization in cardiac surgery ICU will be randomly assigned to proximal or distal approach groups.

If catheterization failed after 3 attempts using the approach allocated, the non-allocated approach will be used.

 The primary endpoint is the first puncture success rates in each approach.

 Comparison of the Proximal Approach and Distal Approach of Axillary Vein Catheterization Under Ultrasound Guidance@highlight

Ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization can be performed via the proximal or distal approach of the axillary vein.

 The aim of our study is to compare the first puncture success rates between the two approaches of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in cardiac surgical patients,as performed by junior intensivists with limited practice experience.
