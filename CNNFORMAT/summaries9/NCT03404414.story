(thirdQuint)Detection of Functioning Pituitary Microadenoma: PET/MRI Versus PET/CT.

 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be insufficient to locate functioning pituitary microadenoma.

This study compared the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas in patients with inconclusive conventional MRI findings.

 Trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy was performed within 2 weeks of imaging.

The PET/CT and PET/MRI findings and tracer uptake levels were correlated with the surgical findings and pathological results.

 Detection of Functioning Pituitary Microadenoma: PET/MRI Versus PET/CT@highlight

This is a prospective case-control study to compare the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas.

A single dose of 370 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 18F-FDG will be injected intravenously.

Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/MRI and PET/CT images.
