(fifthQuint)Evaluation of the Efficacy of Nutritional Risk Screening Tests, NRS 2002 and SGA, to Identifying Malnourished Patients.

 In several hospital clinical trials, the nutritional intervention has been proven to be effective in preventing and/or reducing malnutrition.

 Therefore, a procedure to identify the risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients is necessary to guarantee an adequate and timely nutritional treatment.

 It is mandatory for clinics and health services to perform the screening test for the evaluation of the nutritional status and need in hospitalized patient.

 Aims: The first aim of this study is to compare two validated nutritional screening tools: Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA).

 These are used to identify the risk of malnutrition or malnourishment in hospitalized patients.

 The second aim is to evaluate possible correlations between the tests score and body composition parameters (phase angle of the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, BIA), handgrip strength and biochemical parameters.

 Patients and Methods: The study is currently carried out at the Federico II University Hospital of Naples, Italy.

 The inpatients admitted in the Clinical Wards coming from the Emergency Room of the Hospital since September 2016 are being evaluated.

 The two screening test results and the assessment of the patients' parameters are collected within 72 hours following admission.

 The SGA and NRS 2002 are administered separately.

 Age, sex, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calf circumference and dominant hand of the participants are being noted.

 Venous blood samples are collected for routine biochemistry and inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) early in the morning in the fasting state; all measurements are determined by routine laboratory methods at the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples.
