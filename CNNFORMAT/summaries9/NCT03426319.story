(firstQuint)Cardiovascular Status in Adrenal Insufficiency.

 An unfavorable metabolic profile in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) under hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (HC) has been revealed in one recent analysis.

 Furthermore an increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity in AI is assumed.

 The aim of the study is to evaluate the metabolic profile and cardiovascular status in patients with primary AI.

 Patients with primary AI under standard replacement therapy with HC undergo detailed CV evaluation (including e.

g.

 laboratory test, analysis of endothelial function, 24h blood pressure profile, Holter ECG, echocardiography and cardiac MRI).
