(secondQuint)Low Intensity Exercise in Different Normobaric/Hypobaric Normoxic/Hypoxic Conditions.

.

 Subjects will bike at 1W/kg for 6 minutes at different simulated altitude level in the hypobaric chamber at the FAI in Dubendorf.

 Concentration performance also will be measured to better understand how hypobaric and hypoxia conditions may affect physiological responses, cerebral and cognitive functions.

 Low Intensity Exercise in Different Normobaric/Hypobaric Normoxic/Hypoxic Conditions.

@highlight

The main goal of this project is to investigate how low intensity cycling exercise (1.

5W/kg, for 6 minutes) influences cerebral functions, such as: Cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, and other physiological variables in different normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions.
