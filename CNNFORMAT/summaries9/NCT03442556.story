(fifthQuint)Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and Rucaparib Camsylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer With Homologous Recombination DNA Repair Deficiency.

 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To determine radiographic progression free survival with 4 cycles of docetaxel with carboplatin followed by maintenance rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency.

 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.

 To assess maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to induction docetaxel and carboplatin.

 II.

 To assess PSA response to switch maintenance with rucaparib.

 III.

 To assess PSA response duration to docetaxel and carboplatin followed by switch maintenance with rucaparib.

 IV.

 To assess response of measurable disease.

 OUTLINE: INDUCTION: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on day 1.

 Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 MAINTENANCE: Patients receive rucaparib camsylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

 Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

 Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and Rucaparib Camsylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer With Homologous Recombination DNA Repair Deficiency@highlight

This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel, carboplatin, and rucaparib camsylate work in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer with homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency that has spread to other places in the body.

 Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

 Rucaparib camsylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

 Giving induction docetaxel and carboplatin followed by maintenance rucaparib camsylate may work better in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.
