(thirdQuint)NIBS and Dual-task Walking After Stroke.

 This study will enroll 12 individuals with a stroke at least 6 months ago.

 Participants will be tested across 3 sessions and each session will be approximately 1 week apart from each other.

 During testing, participants will be asked to walk under two conditions: single- and dual-task conditions.

 Under the single-task condition, participants walk on a instrumented mat such that their gait performance will be captured.

 Under the dual-task condition, participants walk on the mat while performing a counting backward task.

 The walking assessment is followed by a 12 minute non-invasive brain stimulation using high frequency rTMS.

 Another walking assessment will be conducted right after the brain stimulation session.

 High frequency rTMS will be applied to different neural loci, namely primary motor cortex, supplementary cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

 The walking speed under two different conditions will be compared before and after brain stimulation to different neural loci.

 NIBS and Dual-task Walking After Stroke@highlight

The study aims to identify neural locus critical for dual-task walking (walking and talking) in individuals with stroke.

 To achieve this aim, the investigators apply repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to different parts of the brain and evaluate the effects of brain stimulation on dual-task walking speed.
