(thirdQuint)Titration Study of ABX-1431.

 This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, optimized titration study of ABX-1431 HCl.

 The study will explore whether patients experiencing ABX-1431-related CNS AE accommodate or become tolerant to them with continued dosing.

 The efficacy of ABX-1431 in treating neuropathic pain will be assessed by the change from baseline in pain intensity scores using numerical rating scale (NRS-11).

 All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria.

 Eligible patients will be treated with daily medication for 28 days which will include some treatment with placebo and some treatment with ABX-1431 HCl.

 Patients will record their daily average pain using a paper numerical rating scale (NRS-11).

 This study will enroll up to 32 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain due to one of the four following diagnostic groups: post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy or post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

 Titration Study of ABX-1431@highlight

This study is designed to identify a titration regimen of ABX-1431 in adults with neuropathic pain with satisfactory tolerability to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events (AEs).

 During the course of this study, each participant will take a daily dose of ABX-1431 or a matching placebo for 28 days.
