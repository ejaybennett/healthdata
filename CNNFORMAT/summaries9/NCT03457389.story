(secondQuint)Comparison of Treatment Outcome of Cabergoline According to Target Prolactin Levels in Patients With Prolactinoma.

 Prolactinoma patients will be assigned to a experimental group that maintains serum prolactin levels below 5 ng/mL and a control group that maintains normal serum prolactin levels.

 After that, cabergoline will be maintained at a therapeutic dose for 130 weeks.

 After cabergoline is discontinued, patients will be followed up with serum prolactin measurement for 52 weeks.
