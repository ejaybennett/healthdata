(firstQuint)Clinical Study for Safety and Acute Performance Evaluation of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF-5D System Used With Fast Ablation Mode in Treatment of Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.

.

 The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and acute performance of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH(R) SF-5D catheter used in combination with the nMARQ cent Multi-Channel RF Generator with TGA mode in the treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) during standard electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures.

 The QDOT-FAST study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, interventional clinical study.
