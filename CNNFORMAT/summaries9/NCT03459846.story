(secondQuint)A Phase II Study of Durvalumab and Olaparib in Advanced, Cisplatin Ineligible Bladder Cancer (BAYOU).

 This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center, comparative global study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + olaparib combination therapy versus durvalumab + placebo (durvalumab monotherapy) as first-line treatment in patients ineligible for cisplatin with unresectable Stage IV urothelial cancer (UC).

 A biomarker enriched study design will be employed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the study treatment arms in both homologous recombination repair mutated (HRRm) and HRR wild-type (HRRwt) patients.
