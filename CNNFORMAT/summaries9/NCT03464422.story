(secondQuint)Adapting an Evidence-based Intervention for Stigma-related Stress, Mental Health, and HIV Risk for MSM of Color in Small Urban Areas.

 This study has two specific aims.

 Aim 1 will focus on the modification of an existing intervention manual (created by the study PI) using feedback from previous qualitative interviews with MSM in New Haven and Hartford, CT.

 Also incorporated will be recent qualitative research on MSM of color's resilience.

 Specifically, the ways in which racial minority stigma impacts the mental health of MSM in small urban areas and adaptive coping skills that MSM can use in the face of these health threats.

 Aim 2, will consist of the deliver of the adapted intervention to 30 young MSM (15 HIV-negative and 15 HIV-positive) to gather data on the feasibility and acceptability of the newly adapted program.

 The evaluation of the new program will be conducted using pre-post comparisons of quantitative assessments and from qualitative interviews hoped to provide information regarding intervention feasibility, acceptability, and any needed refinement.

 This project integrates expertise in culturally-sensitive evidence-based interventions for MSM's HIV risk into a community-based HIV prevention and care context at the Fair Haven Community Health Center, where the intervention will be delivered to the existing patient population.
