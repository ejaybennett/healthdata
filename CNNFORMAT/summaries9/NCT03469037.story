(secondQuint)Effects on Experimental Dyspnea of High Flow Nasal Cannula.

 This study will measure the effect of HFNC on an experimental model of dyspnea induced by thoraco-abdominal elastic strapping on healthy subjects at rest.

 The study will also compare the effects on dyspnea of the administration of high flow nasal cannula with and without oxygen added.

 Effects on Experimental Dyspnea of High Flow Nasal Cannula@highlight

To develop an experimental model of dyspnea by external thoraco-abdominal elastic strapping at rest in order to study the mechanisms involved in the relief of dyspnea by the administration of high flow by nasal cannula (HFNC).
