(secondQuint)Cognitive and Blood Flow Effects of Mountain Tea.

 The presence of polyphenols such as ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid and apigenin in Sideritis Scardica (SS or 'mountain tea') are likely responsible for the cognitive and mood effects of its consumption and this could be underpinned by the ability of such polyphenols to prevent monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake and to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF).

 The current randomised, placebo controlled, parallel groups study extends on the abovementioned small amount of literature; assessing both cognitive and mood outcomes in a sample of older (50-70 yrs) adults, as well as blood pressure (BP) and CBF, in a sub-sample, utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

 The above will be assessed acutely (pre-dose and 90- and 310-mins post dose) on day 1 and following 28 days consumption of either a placebo control, and active control of 240 mg ginkgo biloba, 475 mg SS or 950 mg SS.

Two doses (475 mg and 950 mg) of Sideritis Scardica (SS or 'mountain tea') are investigated for cognitive, mood, blood pressure and cerebral blood flow effects in a healthy group of 50-70 yr olds, both acutely and following 28 days of consumption.
