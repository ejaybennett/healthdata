(secondQuint)Treatment of Osteoarthrosis of the Knee With Platelet Rich Plasma, Comparative Study With Hyaluronic Acid.

 Platelet Rich Plasma and hyaluronic acid are treatments injected directly into diseased knees.

 Both products reduce negative symptoms such as pain and inflammation.

 But they use different mechanisms.

 Plasma is a biological product that acts mainly as an anti-inflammatory reducing pain and collaborating to re establish the chemical balance within the knee, which slows down the deterioration of the joint.

 Hyaluronic acid is a knee lubricant that decreases friction and therefore stress inside the knee.
