 The study population will be selected from prospective, consecutive ambulatory outpatients suspected of having venous thromboembolism.

 Patients will be diagnosed for VTE (PE or DVT) based on local standard of care.

 Samples will be collected for future testing with new D-Dimer assay.

 In case of Low/Moderate PTP score and negative VTE diagnosis, patients will be followed for 3 months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of new D-Dimer assay combined with a clinical pretest probability (PTP) to safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) or Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in a 3 month follow-up.
