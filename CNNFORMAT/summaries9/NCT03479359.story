(thirdQuint)Learning Curve of Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Among Internship.

 Digital rectal examination (DRE) is a basic physical examination in routine practice in Urology.

 The DRE is a very important daily practice for screen prostate cancer, and each internship in Urology is required to perform this for patients suspected of prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia.

 However, how many DRE are usually needed for a internship to perform so as to obtain a stable accuracy in daily practice is currently unknown.

 The investigators thus conduct this prospective trial to investigate the learning curve of DRE among internship.
