(firstQuint)VitalFlow Healthy Volunteer Study.

 Magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve (geniculate ganglion) in humans can induce changes in cerebral blood flow safely, without generating adverse effects unknown to the technique.

 Our specific objectives: 1.

 Perform tolerability and safety tests of magnetic stimulation on the facial nerve.

 2.

 Establish the optimal stimulation threshold associated with tolerability in order to apply it to the final design of the Magnetic Stimulation (MS) system.

 3.

 Measure whether the threshold found shows any increase in cerebral perfusion in the subject with respect to their baseline.
