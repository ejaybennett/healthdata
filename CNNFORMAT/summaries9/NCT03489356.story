(fifthQuint)Project Options - The ABC Method.

 Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.

S.

 and the incidence and mortality from skin cancer is on the rise.

 Individuals can decrease their risk of skin cancer by engaging in protective behaviors such as limiting intentional and unintentional UV exposure, and wearing broad-spectrum sunscreens and protective clothing.

 Despite knowing the risks and receiving dermatological care, many patients with and without a history of skin cancer frequently forget to use UV protection or fail to use it in an optimal manner to reduce their UV risk.

 To address these concerns, Mallett and colleagues developed a 3-minute brief ABC intervention - Addressing Behavior Change.

 The ABC intervention is designed to be delivered by dermatologists in the context of a routine office visit involving a skin examination.

 Previous work by Mallett and colleagues showed dermatologists were highly motivated to deliver the intervention, quickly learned the requisite skills, delivered the intervention with fidelity, and showed minimal decay in knowledge, motivation, and skills over a 6-month period.

 This study builds on a previous study by conducting an examination of the efficacy of the ABC intervention on patients' motivations and behaviors utilizing a prospective longitudinal design.

 Project Options - The ABC Method@highlight

The present study explores the ability of dermatologists to influence patients' behavior using a novel and brief (3 minute) behavioral intervention in the context of naturally occurring patient interactions and shows promise for long term sustainability.

 The incidence of invasive skin cancers, cutaneous melanoma in particular, has nearly tripled in the U.

S.

 between 1975 and 2004, making it the fastest rising incidence rate for all cancers in the United States.

 Dermatologists are in an ideal position to effect change in their patients.

 The present study will assess whether a brief intervention (The ABC-Addressing Behavior Change method) delivered to patients by dermatologists during a skin examination will increase the use of sun protection and reduce risk behaviors compared to patients who receive treatment as usual.
