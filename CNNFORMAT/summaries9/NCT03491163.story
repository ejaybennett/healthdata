(secondQuint)Evaluation of Damaging Factors to Endothelial Glycocalyx During Heart Surgery Pilot Study.

 Study tasks: 1.

 To evaluate changes of syndecan-1 concentration during surgery and postoperative period.

 2.

 Determine the effect of aortic clamping and on-pump duration on endothelial glycocalyx damage.

 3.

 Assess the risk of early postoperative complications and syndecan-1 plasma concentrations.

 4.

 To evaluate the correlation of inflammatory status with glycocalyx damage.

 5.

 To evaluate glycocalyx damage to patients with diabetes vs non-diabetes.

 Methods: Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are being treated at the Heart, Chest and Vascular Surgery Clinic of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital in Kaunas Clinics.

 After receiving patients written consent a syndecan-1 concentration test will be performed upon arrival at the operating room, before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), after CPB, upon arrival in the ICU and after 24 hours.

 All needed data for evaluating patients outcome will be taken from medical documentation during patients stay in hospital.

 Evaluation of Damaging Factors to Endothelial Glycocalyx During Heart Surgery Pilot Study@highlight

Evaluation of endothelial glycocalyx damage in on-pump conventional coronary artery bypass surgery using a syndecan-1 (CD138) blood test.

 The study will be carried out in two stages.

 Pilot study for testing and correcting research methodology and the main study.
