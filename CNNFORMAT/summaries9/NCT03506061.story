(fifthQuint)iPS Cell Response to CFTR Modulators.

 Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).

 Defects in this gene prevent correct chloride absorption in and out of the cells.

 The current trial is intended to show for the first time that primary induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells differentiated to an airway epithelial phenotype can be used to predict in vivo clinical response for a rare CF patient population, with the long-term goal of facilitating drug access for individuals with other rare CF variants.

 This study addresses gaps in knowledge, and limitations to therapeutic drug access, as these features relate to CF precision medicine.

 Specifically this study highlights the situation for individuals carrying P67L, an orphan allele noted in approximately 240 CF patients and emblematic of hundreds of other rare CFTR mutations.

 Individuals with the P67L variant exhibit recurrent pseudomonas pneumonia, reduced FEV1, and early death.

 This study is an open-label, two-center study of orally administered lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi) that will enroll 22 patients (11 at each site) with the P67L/F508del genotype.

 The researchers will monitor clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.

 The researchers will also obtain cutaneous punch biopsy material from each subject so that iPS cells can be differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested for response to Orkambi.

Orkambi is currently approved for patients with CF carrying two copies of the common F508del variant, but not for those with the P67L mutation.

 This is a clinical study of 22 subjects carrying P67L, each given Orkambi for approximately four weeks.

 The researchers will monitor clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.

 Cutaneous punch biopsy material will be obtained from each subject so that iPS cells can be differentiated into airway epithelial monolayers and tested for response to Orkambi.
