(firstQuint)Neurocognitive Decline in Patients With Brain Metastases.

 On review of our experience with treatment for brain metastases since 2009, the investigators have treated over 100 patients with 6 or more metastases in a single radiosurgery session.

 In the past year and a half (2015-16) there have been approximately 50 patients treated with six or more metastases, indicating that there has been a shift in management of intracranial metastatic disease with increasing preference for radiosurgery despite the presences of greater metastatic burden.

 The phase I component will accrue 7-15 patients at each dose cohort until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

 Once the MTD is reached, the phase II component will commence with a total of 50 patients total enrolled at the MTD, with a study time of 3 years.

 The primary endpoint of the phase I component is toxicity.

 The primary endpoint of the phase II component is the change in neurocognitive function, defined by a decline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised delayed recall.

The phase I component of the study is to identify maximal tolerated dose (MTD).

 The phase II is to evaluate neurocognitive decline.
