(firstQuint)Performance Study of a Non-invasive Glucose Monitoring Device Prototype.

 Protocol consists of two parts: Part A) Subjects will collect spectral raman data on device every 15 minutes for 10 hours a day for five days.

 The five days will be distributes with in a timeframe of ten days.

 A Flash Glucose Monitor will be used as a comparator.

 In addition to this, four daily capillary Blood Glucose readings will be collected.

 Part B) Subjects will collect 4 daily optical Raman readings paired with capillary Blood Glucose comparator in own home with maintaining usual diabetes management routines.

 Subjects will collect data for 30 days during a 60 days period.
