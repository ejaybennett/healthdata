(secondQuint)Robotic Assisted Spleen-Preserving No.

 10 Lymph Node Dissection for Locally Advanced Upper Third Gastric Cancer.

 The incidence of No.

 10 lymph node metastasis is high in advanced proximal gastric cancer, reported to range from 9.

8%-20.

9%, and the presence of No.

 10 lymph node metastasis is closely related to survival.

 Therefore, in East Asia, D2 lymph node dissection of potentially curable locally advanced upper third gastric cancer including No.

 10 lymph node is the standard surgical treatment.

 Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive procedures.

 However, it remains a controversial international issue if it is safe and feasible to conduct robotic assisted spleen-preserving No.

 10 lymph node dissection for advanced upper third gastric cancer.

 There is no prospective study to identify the results.

 The study is through a prospective, open, single-arm study,to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted spleen-preserving No.

 10 lymph node dissection in the treatment of locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (cT2-4a, N-/+, M0).

The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical Efficacy of robotic assisted spleen-preserving No.

 10 lymph node dissection for patients with locally advanced upper third gastric adenocarcinoma(cT2-4a, N-/+, M0).
