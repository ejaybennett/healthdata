(firstQuint)Efficacy and Mechanisms of Naltrexone+Bupropion for Binge Eating Disorder.

 Binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder, is associated strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment.

 Improved treatments for patients with BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes.

 This study aims to test the efficacy of Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB; FDA-approved anti-obesity combination medication) for the treatment of BED in patients with and without obesity.

 The RCT will provide new findings regarding the efficacy of NB medication for reducing binge-eating episodes among patients with BED, for reducing weight among patients with BED and obesity, and whether patients with and without obesity derive differential benefit from NB.
