(secondQuint)First in Human Study of IBI310 in Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.

 Phase Ia study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design.

 Dose escalation follows the first accelerate titration (0.

3 mg/kg dose levels).

 Exploring safety and tolerance of 3 dose cohorts (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg).

 The first patient assigned to the 0.

3mg/kg dose group to complete the 21-days dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period.

 Then the study will start 1mg/kg,3mg/kg and 10mg/kg dose group, each dose group assigned 3 patients, after finishing the DLT observation period initiate the next dose level.

 If DLT was present in the first patient of the 0.

3mg/kg dose group, DLT observation and dose escalation should be performed according to the "3+3" design in this group.

 For 1mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg dose groups, such as the first 3 patients were not observed DLT, increase another 3 patients to this dose group for PK analysis and research while entering the next dose group.

 After complete the DLT observation in each dose group, a total of three times IBI310 treatment were given once every three weeks.

 Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by RECIST v1.

1.

 Patients' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity information will be assessed throughout the study.

 Exploration using Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(iRECIST) for IBI310 to evaluate the curative effect in advanced solid tumor patients.

 First in Human Study of IBI310 in Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors@highlight

This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and efficacy of single agent of IBI310 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
