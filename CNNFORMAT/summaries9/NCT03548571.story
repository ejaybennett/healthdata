(secondQuint)Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy Against Cancer Stem Cells in Glioblastoma Patients Receiving Standard Therapy.

 Autologous leukapheresis for enrichment of PBMCs is performed after enrollment of the patient into the trial.

 Ex vivo generated DCs will be frozen and stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen.

 At first surgery, tumor biopsies will be cultured under sphere-forming conditions under ex vivo conditions for enrichment of glioblastoma stem cells.

 mRNA will purified and amplified from these autologous tumor stem cells.

 At specified intervals patients randomized to the vaccine group will receive intradermal injections of DCs transfected with mRNA from autologous tumor stem cells, survivin and hTERT.

 Injections will be given as three separate injections at three separate sites.

 Vaccination will be continued for as long as there are vaccines available.

 Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy Against Cancer Stem Cells in Glioblastoma Patients Receiving Standard Therapy@highlight

Open, randomized study of a trivalent dendritic cell therapy compared to standard therapy in primary treated patients with IDH wild-type, MGMT-promotor methylated glioblastoma.

 The IMP is dendritic cells transfected with mRNA of survivin, hTERT og autologous tumor stem cells derived from tumorspheres.
