(secondQuint)Impact of DAA Uptake in Controlling HCV Epidemic and Modeling Interventions for HCV Elimination Among HIV-infected Persons in San Diego.

 A study that aims to quantify the state of DAA uptake and its impact on the HCV epidemic among PLWH in San Diego, and to characterize negative predictors of DAA treatment uptake among PLWH in San Diego.

 Retrospective and prospective data from UCSD Owen Clinic will be utilized to calculate HCV prevalence, primary incidence, and reinfection incidence.

 Using mathematical epidemic models, the study will assess levels of existing and scaled-up interventions necessary for HCV elimination from PLWH in San Diego.
