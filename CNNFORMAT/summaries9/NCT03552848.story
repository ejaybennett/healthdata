(secondQuint)Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Multiple Organ Failure After Cardiac Surgery.

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are common debilitating complications after cardiac surgery.

 Despite recent advance in surgical technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions.

 There is a growing body of experimental evidence that mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) may be effective in treating critically ill surgical patients who develop multiorgan dysfunction with ARDS, acute renal failure, and secondary infections.

 Therefore, in the present pilot study, the investigators hypothesized that timely initiation of MSC will positively influence ventilation in and survival of patients with ARDS in combination with MODS.

 The indication for MSC was unresponsive severe ARDS in combination with MODS when all the other treatment modalities such as intravenous steroid administration, nitric oxide inhalation, or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation performed within 20 days were unsuccessful.

 The dosage of the MSC was determined on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 100000 cells per kilogram of body weight and administrated intervenously .

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in combination with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after cardiac surgery is a life-threatening condition.

 In this study, patients who are unresponsive to conventional treatment will be treated with umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell.
