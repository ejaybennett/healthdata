(thirdQuint)Early Kangaroo Mother Care in Gambian Hospitalised Unstable Neonates.

 This individually randomised controlled trial will compare 2 parallel groups of hospitalised mild-moderately unstable neonates 24h of admission and when stable.

 The intervention will be un-blinded to participants and researchers with blinding of outcomes where possible.

 If participants clinically deteriorate and meet "stopping criteria" they will be temporarily withdrawn from the intervention arm and re-start KMC when clinically stable, as per the control arm.

 Intention to treat analysis will be used.

 Duration of time spent in KMC will be documented and compared between arms.

 All other hospital management will be provided as per a Standardised Preterm Management Protocol, based on current standard care at the study site and compliance to this protocol will be monitored in both arms.

 Underlying protective mechanisms for early KMC will also be explored, focusing on causal pathways such as thermal control, cardio-respiratory stability, infection prevention control and gastro-intestinal stability pathways.

 Early Kangaroo Mother Care in Gambian Hospitalised Unstable Neonates@highlight

The mortality effect of kangaroo mother care in stable newborns <2000g is well established but mortality effect in unstable newborns is not conclusively known.

 This pragmatic clinical trial aims to investigate the mortality and clinical effects of early continuous Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) compared to standard care in mild-moderately unstable neonates <2000g in a resource limited hospital setting.
