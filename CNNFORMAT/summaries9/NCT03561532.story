(secondQuint)Fecal Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis.

 80 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will be recruited.

 They are randomized to receive either an autologous FMT as a placebo or FMT from a healthy donor (frozen and thawed).

 The patients are followed up with fecal samples to detect microbial changes.

 The follow up lasts 1 year after the FMT and a follow up colonoscopy will be done 52 weeks after the FMT.
