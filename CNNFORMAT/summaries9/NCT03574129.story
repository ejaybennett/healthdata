(secondQuint)Adolescent Transition To Adult Care for HIV-infected Adolescents in Kenya.

 The Adolescent Transition Package (ATP) will include two components.

 The validated Namibia comic book for disclosure (to be used with children over 10 years of age) and an adapted US transition toolkit ("Got Transition").

 The disclosure tool includes a cartoon book, readiness and tracking tools used in clinic and a HCW training.

 The intervention progresses from incomplete to complete disclosure using a narrative about soldiers fighting the battle of infection as the rationale for taking medicine.

 This tool has been validated for use in Namibia.

 The adapted transition toolkit will be developed prior to the trial utilizing input from health care workers workers providing services to adolescents, HIV policy makers, caregivers of HIV infected adolescents and HIV infected adolescents.
