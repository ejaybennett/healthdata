(secondQuint)Acute Exposure of Simulated Hypoxia on Cardiac Output.

 Low altitude baseline measurements will be performed in Zurich (469m asl) including Echocardiography, right heart catheterization, 6MWT, pulmonary function test, clinical assessment and blood gas analysis at rest and under exercise.

 Randomly assigned to the order of testing, the participants will be tested under simulated altitude (FiO2: 15.

1% with the AMC Altitrainer) and shamed altitude with the same device.

 During the exposure to simulated altitude (FiO2: 15.

1%) and shamed alitude of 1 hour each, the participants cardiac output non-invasively assessed will be measured throughout the whole intervention.

 Acute Exposure of Simulated Hypoxia on Cardiac Output@highlight

Randomized crossover trial in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension (PAH, CTEPH) to assess the acute response to simulated altitude (FIO2: 15.

1% = equivalent to 2500m above sea level) on non-invasive cardiac output assessments by Finapres(R) NOVA Technology at rest and under exercise.
