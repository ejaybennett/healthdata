(secondQuint)Muscle Activity of the Upper Limb Between Task-Specific and Robot Assisted Training Among Individuals Post Stroke.

 Twenty sub-acute post stroke subjects received one TST and one RAT.

 They marked the pain level in their paretic extremity before and after each session.

 Muscle activity levels and fatigue and number of repetitions were monitored during each session.

 The subjective assessment questionnaire of treatment and the Borg scale were administered post-session.
